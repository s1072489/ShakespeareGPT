Robte E. of Essex, hold vp thy hande,
I have
a true harte to her Ma=tie= and my countrye and have done nothinge but that w=ch= by the Lawe of nature and the necessitie of my case I was inforced vnto;
ffor
yf a man intend the deathe of a kinge beinge the heade of the comon welthe w=t=hout w=ch= the members cannot live, it is Treason: they not onlye intended but allso acted so far forthe as was in there powre vz: By assemblinge a powre and encitinge the Subiectes to Rebell,
Th'earle
hathe done both, for he hath raised a power in a setled govermen=t= w=ch= the lawe intendes to be a purpose to destroye the kinge, for he y=t= abusethe the gou'm=t= hates the Governor. The contynuingeof his power assembled at Essex house being comaunded to disperse them, is playne Treason. Agayne
to rayse force to take a Towne, forte or place of defence is Treason: the E. of Essex raised a force not to take a small Towne but the verie Cittye of London: not a slend=er= fforte but y=e= Towre, nor there to rest, but to attempt the sacred Pallace of the Prince, killinge her subiectes after a most disloyall mane=r=. What shold I say more,. But what answeres my Lo. of Essex? that the Lawe of nature comaunndes and he was bound to his owne defence. But I will shewe that he transgressed the Lawes both of God & Nature and of reacon's. Consider first the Quallitie of the offence, 2 the manner 3 the p'sons by whome 4 the p'sons against whome it was comitted, and they shall be lefte w=t=hout excuse. And ffirst let me tell them, that Treason for satisfacon of a passion in Nature is noe excuse to Treason. All offences gainst God and nature, are: Rebellion worst of all confoundes all Nature, God and reacons. This Treason is for y=e= quallitie p'meditate and aymed at the heade, even of her Ma=tie=: ffor the manno=r= howe soddaine soev=er= yet it is highe Treason: ffor soddaine Treason is not les daungero=s= then y=t= w=ch= is of longer growth. But my Lo. yo=r= offence was past an imaginerie offence, it was; neither was it of that soddaines as yo=u= wold have it beleeved, ffor yo=u= wore a black bag about yo=r= necke conteininge a Catologue of the names of such as were mene of yo=r= number: a black bagg was meetest for such a black cause: But my Lo. there lyes a greate burthen vppon yo=r= Lo=p= for drawinge so many worthye gent. into so desp'ate and detestable a busines. ffor the p'sons by whome thes Treasons were comitted, they received there first breath vnd=er= her mat=ie's= gou'nm=t=: Th'earldome of Essex given to his father by her ma=tie=; howe she hath loaden this man w=th= hono=ers=, offices and dignities, the world can testifie
above all her ma=tie's= favo=res= made him greate, neither was it fruitles to his estate: for I am able to p've and make good accompte that her ma=te's= guiftes to himamounted to 300 thousand poundes. Allso the Earle of South: received divers favo=res= from her ma=tie=, thoughe for his misdemeano=res= it pleaseth her to thinke worse of him. The p'son against whome thes treasons were intended was against her sacred ma=tie=, against the Relligion w=ch= her highenes sincerely p'fesseth at home and p'tecteth in other provinces: and her exercise of Justice comixed w=th= admirable mercy, w=ch= is aparant in this, that in the examinacon of all the p'sons imp'soned for this facte, none were rackte nor offer of fortune made vnto them. And an other thinge materiall to be noted comes into my mynde, no two of the examinantes spake togither & yet they all agree in y=e= substance of theire tales.
the Lo=es= of the Counsell put vnto them 2 Counsello=res= of State to summon him; the reason because there was a Roytous company assembled, The intent to admonish him, he camnot, was forborne till the next day y=t= a guilty conscience counselled him to put himselfe into strengthe: ffor there were forces expected from Wales, y=e= discou'ie whereof th'earle nowe doubted & Consultacon was had amongst them 3 monthes before whether was best, first to surprize the Tower and Court, or to p've there freindes in London. Allso at Drewrie house, it was resolved vppon 4 daies before theie brake owte into open rebellion y=t= to goe to y=e= Courte was y=e= best: then was allotted to eurie one his severall place of charge, S=r= Christopher Blunt, a reconcyled Papist, to haue charge of the vtter gate, S=r= John Davies the Hall, a Papist likewise & S=r= Charles Davers the presence, a secret Papist (as is confessed), Th'erle of Essex the privye Chamber: Should the Court have bene thus guarded, oh (saith) S=r= Christopher Blunt, what fearefull humo=er= shall we fynde them in at Courte when we surprize them. Well what shold be the end of y=e= surprize? forsoothe to call a p'liament. A bloody parliam=t= wold that haue bene when yo=r= Lo=p= that nowe standeth all in black, shold haue worne a bloody Robe. But my hope is y=t= he shalbe Robte the laste Earle of his house that wold have bene Robte the first Kinge of this land. Well what did he? heassembles a greate number of Barons, Earles and gent. of Quallitie, yet her ma=tie= held gracous and sent vnto him favo=r= vz. the Lo. Keep: th'earle of Worcester, the Comptroller and the Lo. Cheife Justice, two of them of his owne blood, th'other, men that never malliced him, as himselfe will (I thinke) confess. Thes charged him vpon his alledgiaunce, to lay downe his Armes and to disolve his troupe. Nowe marke the fury of a rebellious company, They cried owte kill them, kill them, we shall have the less to doe, they but abuse and goe aboute to betraye yo=u=: here you see Treason in the house: before he went owte he was a Trayto=r=: when he came into the Citty whatt did he? even followed the rules of Treason: Treason durst never looke directlye vppon a Prince, for the Ma=tie= of godes annoynted doth ever cast forth such beames as daunteth the eye of disloyaltie and therefore he p'tendes a cause of stirringe the State, Or (saith he) at firste entraunce I shold haue bene murthered by my Lo. Cobham and S=r= Walter Raleighe but when he was gott w=t=hin them & began to speake nearer to them, then an other cause was invented, vz. y=t= the Kingdome of England sholde be soulde to the INFANTA of Spayne: In the end fyndinge in London truer hartes then he expected, he resolved vppon his retorne, what to doe? to burne some pap'r least they shold hurte his freindes:
My Lo.
began to tell us that one was touchinge th'erle of South: in whiche instant one at my back, cryed owte kyll them, kill them: he said he knewe him not yf he sawe him agayne, but he was suer he had on a white Sattin doblett.
but
for any intent of treason towarde her Ma=tie= or the State, I am cleare and I can avowe asmuch for the rest there p'sent. But my Lo. Steward and the rest of yo=r= Lop=s=, I wold not that yo=u= shold mistake me in this, as if I went aboute to saue my Lyfe: no, I despise it and am at peace w=th= god and have forgott the world, beinge more desirous to dye then to live. That w=ch= I speake is rather in satisfacon of this nobleman that standeth by me and the rest that are engaged w=th= me, whose hartes are purely affected and whose bodyes are able to serve theire sou'aigne and their countrye. But to confirme in me the doubte of beinge s=r'=prised in my house, S=r= Walter Raleighe pleaded S=r= fferdinando Gorges to leave vs or he was lost, tould him that he came owte of a sinkinge ship. And the adviser on Saterday night and Sunday morninge, came not from light and vayne reportes but from an honorable adu'tisem=t=. But my Lordes
I haue had very uniust courses vsed against me, Papists soughte owte to accuse, as Tho. Blunt, and one Sudall a Preiste, Allsoe Bales a Scrivener confessed to me and others that he counterfeited my hand twelve tymes. What measure might I then expect from such begininge?
w=ch=
was never ment yo=u=.
S=r= fferd. Gorges I wish yo=u= shold speake any thinge that shold do yo=r= self good, but remember that yo=u= are a gent. and that yo=r= reputacon oughte to be deare vnto yo=u=. I pray yo=u= answere, did yo=u= advise me to cease my enterprise? My Lo.
I thinke I did. Nay
it is no=w= not tyme to answere vppon thinkinge, did yo=u= indeede so counsell me?
I did.
Well, let his lyfe and my death witneshowe truely he speakes.
But
put the case as yo=u= wold haue it, that it was advised both to attempt the Courte and Towre att once, neither of the two was done: how can it then be made treason? It is true we did consult at Drewry house, about securinge the E. of Essex his arrest free from impeachm=t= and that for noe other end, but to p'strate o=r= selves at her mat=e's= ffeete, humblie submittinge o=r= selves to her m=er=cye, and laying forth our greifes to her self, whereof we thought she had noe true informacon from others. this was the end of o=r= meetinge, and not w=th= any treasonable thought of my p'te. I take god to record, and
I desire the opinion of the Judges, whether one thinge consulted vppon and an other executed be Treason, ffor we talkte of goinge to the Courte, the Towre allso was talked vppon, but the counsell was reiected, and this yo=u= will haue to be treason. ffor my p'te I knewe nothinge in the morninge when I came to Essex house of o=r= goinge into London. when I was in London I hard not the p'clamacon, I was not neare by the lengthe of the streete. Let my Lo. Burleigh speake (I knowe him hon=or=able) whether he sawe me in London or not. I never drewe my sword all the daye. I am charged to carry a pistoll: I had none when I went owte. when I came into London I sawe one havinge a pistoll. I desired it of him and had it. But it had never a stone nor cold it have hurte a flye. At my retorne into Essex house I did there what I could to hind=er= the shootinge, and for that ende sent Capt. White about the house. ffrom this kinde of behavio=r= can be gathered noe thoughtes of Treason, and therefore I beseech yo=u= my Lordes, to censure me not accordinge to the letter of theLawe but as in yo=r= trewe consciences yo=u= are p'swaded of me, And in that I was tofarr carryed w=th= love to my Lo. of Essex I confesse to haue offended, that before rehersed beinge the onely drift and scope of my purpose in this busines.
Is this
not Treason to force the Queene in her owne house, to sett guardes at her gates in her Chambers and all p'tes of house, to thinkentthat havinge her in yo=r= power yo=u= mighte doe what yo=u= listed. Good M=r= Attorney
let, let me aske yo=u= what yo=u= thinke in yo=r= conscience, we wold haue done w=th= the Queene yf we had gayned the Courte. I p'test vppon my soule and conscience
I do beleeve she shold not have longe lived after she had bene in yo=r= power. Note but the p'sidentes of former ages, how longe lived Rich. the 2. afte=r= he was surprised in the same manner. the p=re=tence was alike, for removinge of c=er=taine counsellor=es=, but it shortely after cost him his lyfe. such is the vnquenchable thirst of Ambition, w=ch= never can be satisfied so longe as any greatnes is left vnatchived. but know this for certaine, that to make the Courte or Tower a defence for private enemyes is playne Treason.
yo=u= p'duce heere Ex. of wittnesses against me, they are in like state as I am, they speake like men desirous to live, they testifye against me. What reward doe they hope for? Lyfe. I wish that w=ch= they speake may purchase that vnto them. ffor I never ment to Endaunger any of theire lives, howsoever I speede this daye. it is to me a thinge indifferent. I am not in Love w=th= my Lyfe, nor have bene a longe tyme. I could haue bene contented to haue dyed in my house when I was besett: But I thancke Allmightie God, that he hath reserved me to this daye's tryall: But I was driven to this hazard by those that have the Queene's care and doe abuse it, inforcinge againste me many vntruthes, w=ch= knowinge I choose rather to hazard her Ma=te's= mercy: then to abide the daungerous courses that shold run against me.
I expected not
that the matter of defence shold have bene alledged for excuse, therefore I must allter my speeche from that I entended. To Rebell in Defence, is a matter not hard of; in case of Murder, defence is a good Plea, but in this case, to doe all that was done that daye, and then to goe abowte to blamich it, I cannot allowe: I speake not nowe to simple men, I speake to them that can drawe p'se owte of the nature of the thinges themselves. It is knowne by bookes, by experience and by common talke, that noe Lawfull intendimt=es= are bent directlie againste the Prince, but there is a walteringe of gou'm=tes= (as the phrase is in Scottland). thes goe noe way but by p'ticular Iniuries. My Lo=rs=, I cannot resemble yo=r= p'ceedinges more rightlie then to y=t= of Pisistratus in Athens, who launched himself to th'intent that by the sighte of bleedinge woundes, the people might beleve he was set vppon: Yo=r= Lop. gave owte that yo=r= lyfe was soughte by the Lo. Cobham and S=r= Wa. Ra: and carried allwayes such a shewe of religion in yo=u= that mens eyes were not able throughe suche a myste to behould the deceipte. But yo=u= imprisonne the Counsell: what reference hath that facte to my Lo. Cobhm~ or the rest. yo=u= alledged the matter to have resolved vppon on the soddaine. No, yo=u= weare three monthes in deliberacon. My Lo. descend into yo=r= self, and strip yo=u= of excuse: the p'ties yo=u= shott att (yf yo=u= could haue rightly vnd=er=stood) were yo=r= best ffreindes.
ffor
M=r= Bacon beinge a daylie Courtier, and havinge accesse to her Ma=tie= vnd=er=tooke to goe to the Queene in my behalf, and for that ende drue a letter very artificiallye, w=ch= was subscribed w=th= my name, allso another letter was drawne, to occasion that letter, w=ch= other came from his brother M=r= Anthony Bacon, both w=ch= he shold shewe the Queene. Gosnole broughte me both the letters, and in my letter he did pleade for me, as feelingly against those enemyes and pointed them owt as plainely as was possible.
But
lett it be indifferently iudged whether I had cause of greife or not, when I was informed by those of good Credditt, that an honorable, grave, and wise Counsello=r= did with teares lament the co=r=ses they were takinge, that besides for that I spake in London, that the INFANTA of Spayne was intytled to the succession: I had reason, ffor it was tould me that M=r= Secretarye so sayde to one of his fellow Counsello=rs=, that the INFANTA'S tytle Compativelie, was as good as any other in the succession. Allso I sawe soe many oppressions in the State, y=t= I was desirous to sacrifice my selfe in the redresse thereof by doinge any thinge that a Loyall subiecte mighte to doe them w=th=.
My Lo. ffor witt I give yo=u= the p'eminence, yo=u= have it aboundantlie. ffor birthe I give yo=u= place. I am not noble, yet I am a gent: neither am I a sword man. Yo=u= haue therefore the oddes of me. Butt I have inocencye to p'tect mefrom yo=r= malicious slander, and I stand here in the p'son of an honest man: yo=u= there in the p'son of a Trayto=r=. Wherefore I do here challenge yo=u= yf yo=u= dare, to name vnto this honorable assembley, that Counsell=r= to whome I shold speake those wordes.
Then
it must be beleeved to be a ficcon. No
it is not, for the noble man that standeth by me hard it: and it was told ioyntlie to vs both.
if it be so then, my Lo. I coniure yo=u= by all the love and frendshipp that hath bene betwixte vs, and as yo=u= are a Christian: by the hono=r= of yo=r= name and howse and whatsoever else yo=u= hold honorable, as I p'test I holde yo=u= severed from him in impudencye, that yo=u= name here the Counsell=r= to whome I shold speake it.
I refer me
to yo=r= self S=r=, and if you will say vppon yo=r= hono=r= y=t= it were fitt I did name him, I will. I p'test
before you and heaven, that yow shouldyo=r= Prince and Countrye a most acceptable s'vice, for I were a verie vnworthye man to hold that place I doe in the State if I were to be touched in that sorte.
beinge in speeche together aboute those matters, oh (q=th= S=r= Chr. Blunt), my Lo. you are in passion against those of my p'fession: whereunto I answered, did you never knowe y=t= at such tyme as I had power in the State, I was willinge noe man shold be trobled for his conscience.
I was ignorant
of the Lawes, therefore mighte easely transgress the bondes thereof. The first and onely motive thatmy stirr w=th= my Lo. was my love to my Lord, tyed vnto him both by the bondes of Allegiance and his manifold des'tes towardes me. In respect whereof I was content to indure w=th= him the utmost hazard: for I sawe his case verie desp'ate for fav=or= & therefore I consulted w=th= others to steere his passage to her Ma=tie=. I p'test before allmightie God for noe other end then to p'strate o=r=selves at her ffeete, wherein was never mencon made of sheddinge one drop of blood, And if in this my affection, I have bene transported beyond the Limittes of the Lawe, and that her highenes is displeased therew=th=, I doe in all humblenes crave her p'don and mercye, wherein I will never dispaire. I hope her Ma=tie=, beinge Gode's Leivetenante vppon earthe, will imytate him in Lookinge to the Earle and not condemne me for that, wherein onely through ignoraunce of her Lawes I have offended.
S=r= Willm. Knollis
is sent for. I knowe not by what messenger, neither whether he will come or not. I therefore beseech yo=r= grace y=t= some sure gent. may be sent as hath free access to her Ma=te's= p'son, and y=t= may p'sent vnto her my humble desire that it wold please her to comaunde him to come, and in my opinion this gent. that standes here, M=r= Knyvett, a gent. of her Ma=te's= preivy Chamber, were a verie meete man.
M=r= Knivet goe and deliver faithfullie this messuage to her Ma=tie= & I further coniure yo=u= as yo=u= are a gent. and do tend=r= yo=r= reputacon, by all o=r= Love and by y=e= dutye yo=u= owe to o=r= Sou'aigne and Conterye, that yo=u= add this further from me to her Ma=tie=, That if either owt of want of care of me, or content to her self, she shall deny to send him, I doe here vowe vppon my salvacon, that I will never s've her as a Counsello=r= or Secretarie, but will live and dye her subiect and vassaile. I pray you forgett not to deliver it w=th= this p'viso, that I will dye her vassayle and subiect.
No
But S=r= John Davis witnesseth a plain resolucon,
Neither
did I ever drawe my sworde, till I was charged at Ludgate, where I was shott twice in the hatt. I was told my Lo. of Cumberland was there. I desired to speake w=th= him and to make my self be vnd=er='stoode of him. And for that end willed the Company that was w=th= me to stay.
Is it not a straunge impudency in that Dallman to give equall righte in the succession of England, to the Infanta as to any other. herevppon
was grownded the sclaunder of M=r= Secretarye, whereof he is as cleare as any man here p'sent.
noe my Lo.
yo=r= Lo. owt of yo=r= mallice to me desires to make me odious, and of yo=r= mallice haue noe other ground, then the breath betwene vs of the peace w=th= Spayne, w=ch= I labored for the good and quyett of my Countrye, as for my affection to advaunce a Spanyshe tytle to England, I am so far from y=t=, that I hate to think of it. And I pray god to consume me where I stande, If I doe not hate the Spanyard as much as any man lyvinge. But w=th= yo=u= it hath ever bene a MAXIME, to pr'fer warr before peace, in respecte of the consequence to yo=r= followers, and dependers.
And make me
as wicked as owte of any hum=r= of yo=r= harte yo=u= wold make me, yet yo=u= shall not make me absurd to goe into the Cittye after such a fashion as yo=u= describe yf I had not apprehended an ymminent daunger.
Nay my Lo.
howsoever yo=u= goe aboute to cloake matters, and to make a p'tence of an innocente harte, these Deposicons of men of yo=r= owne companye admytt noe contradiction: And I wond=er= not at yo=r= denyall, for yo=u= will appeare to be of all religions, one while Papist, an other while a Puritaine, and that but to gayne vnto yo=r= selfe all sortes of people. It will allso be p'ved that yo=u= have practized w=th= Tyrone:
Yes
yo=u= sent Lea to him as he hath confessed.
yes
and it shall appeare, that Lea had direction from you to attempt the Queene, for the w=ch= he was executed as a Trayto=r= the other daye.
ffor
Bothe S=r= John Davies and S=r= Charles Davers doe depose that yo=u= said vnto them that black bagg could tell that yo=u= were betrayed in London. W=ch= allso is witnessed byBussell, who was very forward w=th= yo=u=. But yo=u= were confident in London, havinge beene p'swaded by yo=r= sicophantes that all the Cittie was of yo=r= p'te and in yo=r= pride and overweeninge of theire p'takinge, yow contemned the Q=ne's= Royall authoritye, her herraldes wold not be harkened vnto.
I never
conferred nor attempted any thinge but to th'ende to serve my Countrie and sou'aigne, by makinge her Ma=tie= vnd=e='stand vs, w=ch= we cold not doe for the potencye of o=r= enemyes, that were aboute her. And therefore I do laye a charge vppon yo=u= all my Lo. and those that be hearers that notw=t=hstandinge all Eloquence vsed to make me seeme a Trayto=r=, a Papiste, a Sectarie and an Atheiste, and to haue vsurped the Crowne, yo=u= will yet witnes w=th= me and so I doubte not but to manifest, by goinge w=th= a courage and cherefully vnto my death, that I dye a good Christian, and never soughte to exceede the degree of a subiecte: howsoever I have bene delte w=t=hall. I euere soughte to appease all humo=r= of revenge, and for confirmacon thereof was resolved to receave the Sacram=t= till the attempt vppon the E. of South. I am far from Atheisme, and doe desire to dye as a Christian and an Earle, that haue faithfullie s'ved my Prince and Countrye, whatsoever others have testified, out of the weaknes of theire hartes against me, or to seeme to haue said enoughe I desire it may not lye heavye vppon me. I never thoughte of a p'liam=t=.
ffor
yo=u= drewe manye Earles, Barons and gent: of greate houses into the busines w=th= yo=u=. howe shall it be though=t= yo=u= could haue rewarded them owte of yo=r= maymed estate.
noe other waye then vppon o=r= knees to her Ma=tie=.
I doubte the varietie of the matter,and digressions haue sev=er='ed the Judgm=t= of the Lo: And therefore I hold it necessarie to recyte the Judges opinyons.
Nowe put case
the E. of Essex intent were as he wold have it beleeved, to goe as a Sup=lt= to her Ma=tie=, yet shall their peticons be armed peticons, w=ch= allwayes p'cede losse of libertie to the Prince. Neither is it a nyce poynt of Lawe (as my Lo. of South: wold have it beleved) that condemnes them of treason. But even Comon sence to Consulte to execute and run together in numbers, in these doblettes and hose, armed w=th= weapons, what can be the excuse? Warned by the Lo. Keep: by a herrald, and yet p'sist, Will any simple man take this for les then Treason?
it was not the company yo=u= carryed w=th= yo=u= that yo=u= trusted vnto but the assistance w=ch= you hoped for in the Cittye. The GUISE thurste himselfe into Paris against the Kinge, with onelye a gent., and found that helpe there w=ch= yo=u= (thanckes be to God) fayled of here. And what followed? The Kinge was put to his Pillgrime's habitt, and in that disguise was forced to escape the furye of the Guise: yo=u= came w=th= fayer pr'tence, w=th= all hayle and a kisse, to the Cittye, but the ende was treason. And that hath bene sufficiently p'ved.
how say yo=u= my Lo. is my Lo. of Essex:
