Is this Deposition true?
Yes.
Was thenever in the Line?
No.
Was she ever within Point-blank?
No, not when I saw her.
What time did you see her?
I saw her several times that Day.
Did you see the Fireship go down?
Yes.
Did theattempt to cover her?
No.
Did she ever attempt to cover the?
She went down to theat Night, when we wore, but not before.
Was she near you when you brought up?
Yes, she presently fell farther a-stern of us and to leeward, but not so far as to form the Line.
Was she ever within Point-blank?
No.
What time was theengaged with the threeShips?
I cannot tell.
Do you remember any thing of theanddriving away the first Ship they engaged before the Wind?
No, I never saw any of theShips a-stern of their Admiral, but before the Wind.
Did you see theengage them?
Yes.
Where was thethen?
To windward of the.
How far to windward?
A long Mile from, but not so far to windward.
Was thethen engag'd?
No, thewas then farther from the Enemy than theby a Mile.
When did you see theengaged?
I believe an Hour after the Admiral began.
Was there any Ship for you to engage at first?
Yes, if we had gone into our Station.
When you haul'd your Wind was there any Ship before your Beam?
No.
Did thebear away before the Admiral wore?
Yes.
How long before?
I can't tell exactly.
Was she in a Line with thethen?
I can't say; she was not so far to Leeward as the Admiral was when he began to engage.
Was theconsiderably to windward of thethen?
Yes.
When was that?
Just before the Admiral made the Signal and wore.
How much before?
About half an Hour.
Was thefiring then?
Yes.
Was she within Gun-shot?
No.
What time was that?
When she bore away, half an Hour before the Admiral wore.
Was she then engaging briskly?
Yes.
Did you ever see theengage within Point-blank?
She was pretty near it.
Was it in thePower to have gone down with her?
Yes, I saw nothing to hinder her.
Was theany way disabled?
No, she cou'd not be disabled, because she had had no Engagement before that.
When you saw thefiring smartly, where was the headmost of the five of the Enemy coming up in respect of the?
It was when one or two of the headmost Ships fired at the Fireship, and they were then shot past the.
How was thethen in respect to you?
Abreast of us, half a Mile nearer the Enemy.
Did you fire a Gun then?
Yes.
What time of the Day was it?
About four.
Did your Shot fall short?
Yes.
Was thethen half a Mile nearer the Enemy than you?
Yes.
Did the Enemy return any Shot to you?
No.
Did any Shot go over the?
Not at that time; when we wore there did.
If theandhad engaged those Ships as closely as they ought to have done, wou'd they have stoppedthose Ships from annoying ours, and hinder'dthem from getting up till the Vice-Admiral's Division had got up?
We have a Right to ask any Questions we think fit, and you are at liberty to ask any Question you think proper, and we have shewn you a particular Indulgence in that respect.
We wou'd have attack'd them with five of our Ships, that is, the,,,,; but I can't say whether theandonly cou'd have stop'd them.
Were the, ornear enough to attack them?
If they had gone into their Station, they would have been near enough.
Did you ever see thego near to assist the Ship attack'd by theand?
No.
Did you see any Shot go over the?
Not till we wore.
What distance was the headmost from the, andfrom the?
I can't tell.
Did you ever see thebear under theStern?
Yes, just before we wore, and she fired at the Enemy under thestarboard Quarter.
When you saw theunder theStern, where was the?
This was just before we wore, she was then firing at the Enemy.
Do you remember, when the Admiral wore, how many of the four or five Sail of the Enemy had past before theBeam?
I can't tell exactly.
You was a-head and could see.
I don't remember whether any of them open'd a-head of the.
Was any of them a-head of you?
When I fired a Shot, I don't remember whether the two headmost were a-head or a-stern of the.
Was thethen directly to leeward of you?
Yes, half a Mile nearer the Enemy, it cou'd not be more, because of our wearing soon after, and we had not Room to wear short of her, but soon fell on board of her, which obliged us to shift our Helm, by which we were jostleddown very near the Enemy; the Fire from the Muzzel of our Guns set her Spritsail on fire.
Was thedirectly a-breast of you then?
Yes.
How was the Admiral in respect of you when thewas a-breast of you?
Upon our Lee-Bow.
Was thebetween you and the Enemy when you fired?
Yes, I fired two single Shot from our lower Deck, with the Guns laid down in the Carriage, both which I saw fall short.
Did the five of the Enemy continue their Course under the same Sail?
Yes.
Supposing thehad bore down in a Line with the Admiral, and brought up in a Line when he did, how long would it have been before thewould have had any Ship to engage?
If thehad gone down and brought up in a Line with the Admiral, she would have been in a proper Position to engage the five Sail of the Enemy coming up.
Did thestop those Ships from getting up?
No, I believe not.
From the beginning of the Engagement till the Admiral wore, did you ever observe theannoy the Enemy in any Shape whatever?
No, she fired a good deal, but not within a Distance to do Execution.
Did you see any Shot of the Enemy come over the, when she was a-breast of you?
No.
Did you see the Fireship go down?
Yes.
Did any of the Enemy fire at her?
The headmost of the five Sail did.
Was the Rupert within Gun-shot of them then?
No.
Was the?
No.
Was thealways to windward of the?
Yes.
Did any Shot of the Enemy reach you?
Yes, at first.
How was theoff you then?
To leeward of us.
Did you from the time the Shot reach'd you, continuehauling off?
Yes.
Did thehaul off too?
Yes.
What was the meaning of your hauling off?
Had you received any Damage, or had the?
No.
Did thecontinue hauling off?
Yes, till she bore away again, and begun to fire briskly in the Evening.
How long was it from thefirst bearing up, till she bore down again?
I never saw that she bore away again from the Beginning, till half an Hour before the Admiral wore.
Did you ever see thehad received any Damage to prevent her going into her Station?
No, at no time of the Day.
In the Evening, when you wore, did not you engage the fiveShips a-stern, and how was it possible, if once they got a-head of the, for theto wear and engage them in passing?
Thehad bore away, and was firing at those Ships upon the Admiral's wearing; it was then that I observed the.
If the five Ships once past me, how could I go under the Stern of the Admiral and all the other Ships, and engage those five Ships in passing?
They were not a-breast of you when you fired at them.
You say that I was engaged with the five Ships, that I was half a Mile from you, and that I was out of point-blank, then how could I shoot up to you in the Wearing, and engage the five Ships in passing?
You did not shoot up to us, we came down to you.
Did you ever see theengage a single Ship?
No.
How far were the five Ships of the Enemy from you when the Admiral first engaged?
Three Miles, as near as I can judge, not so far a-stern, rather upon our lee-quarter.
How many Ships were there a-stern of the?
Five.
What Sail had the five Ships out?
I can't say particularly, the two headmost had all their Sails set.
Did they all come up in a Line?
They appeared to me so.
How did they bear from you then, and how did your Head lye?
We were lying to, close to the Wind, and they were right a-stern of us by springing our Luff from them.
Did thefire before the?
Yes.
Were theandfiring together at the same Time?
Yes, in the Evening, when you was firing briskly.
As thewas between you and the Enemy, how could you distinguish whether I was near enough to do Execution?
I could judge of the Distance as it appeared to me, and by our Shot falling short by the Distance you were from us, and the Distance we were from the Enemy; I think we in thewere two Miles from them, and you half a Mile nearer than we.
Then I was a Mile and a half off?
Yes.
From the Situation you lay to windward, could you judge whether thewas in a Line with the Admiral?
Yes, because you was so near us, therefore I am sure you was not in a Line.
If thehad gone down in a proper Line at first, would there have been any Ship for her to engage?
If you had continued going down with an easy Sail till you had compleated the Line from the, I judge you would have fell in a-breast of the Headmost Ship of the Five; for the, by continuing her Course down, fell a-breast of the Second; a little more of her Port-helm in going down, would have laid her along-side of the Third, you might have taken the Second, and we in thethe First.
If I had gone down to the Headmost of the Five Ships, how far should I have been from you, supposing you had gone in the Line?
At a proper Distance; a Quarter of a Mile.
How was thefrom the other three Ships?
Three Miles the most at first; but had you gone down with an easy Sail, as that Space was growing less and less, when you had got down so far as to be in a Line, you would have been a-breast of the Headmost of those Ships.
Was you far out of your Station at your first bringing to?
No.
Then how could I have any Ship to engage?
But we were a great Way from the Enemy when that Shot reached us; I judge theDistance from thewas about two Miles, and her Weather Guns would carry a Shot that Distance.
Do you think in the Situation I was in, if the five Sail of the Enemy had held their Course they first steer'd, could they have fetch'd me?
No, they steer'd for their Admiral; if they had kept their Wind close, they might have fetch'd you.
Did you wear a-head or a-stern of the fiveShips in the Rear, when you wore?
We wore and past a-stern of them; when we wore they were put before the Wind.
Did you engage them as you past?
We engaged with our Larboard Guns when we wore.
As all these Gentlemen have been already examined, and cross-examined upon former Tryals, it will be impossible for me to find out any Mistakes they are guilty of; and therefore I would beg of every Gentleman that is a Member of the Court, to destroy the Minutes they have taken upon the former Tryals, that they may have no Influence in regard to the Sentence that may be pass'd upon my Conduct.
I believe every Gentleman that is a Member of the Court, will not only destroy the Minutes taken upon former Tryals, but endeavour to forget as much as possible, every thing that has pass'd upon former Tryals.
I mention this, not that I have the least Suspicion of the Court, but because I hope to prove that you never yet had a right understanding of the Matter.
You are not to dictate to the Court; every Body here are Persons of Honour, and will do you Justice; and therefore I think that Speech of yours very ungenteel.
Did thehaul up to windward of the Admiral?
Yes.
Did she fire?
Yes, between three and four.
At what Ship?
At the Sternmost Ships coming up.
Was she within point-blank?
No, I think not.
Did you see thewhen her Masts went away?
Yes.
Did theassist her?
No.
Did you see the Fireship go down?
Yes.
Where was thethen?
To windward.
Did she cover the Fireship?
No, not that I saw.
Did you ever see thein the Line?
No, I don't know how she might have been in the Evening.
Did you ever see thewithin point-blank, from the Beginning of the Engagement till the Admiral wore?
No.
If she had gone within point-blank, would she have been to leeward of the?
At what Time?
When the Headmost of the five Ships came up?
I can't judge.
How far was you to windward of the Line?
A good Way; three Quarters of a Mile, or more.
How far was theto leeward of you?
Two Cables length and a half.
What Time did you observe thefire smartly?
Between three and four.
What Ship did she fire at?
At the five Sail coming up.
At which of them?
Faith I can't tell.
Did you ever observe the five Sail pass before the Beam of the?
I can't tell whether they did or no.
Did they ever alter their Course, or shorten Sail when they fired at any of our Ships?
No, our Ships were at too great a Distance for that.
Was there Wind sufficient for theto have gone down near enough to have engaged them properly?
Yes.
When themade a warm Fire, did any of the Enemy's Shot come over her?
No.
Did you see any of them fall short?
No.
Did you see thefire?
Yes.
Did you see thethen?
I must have seen her.
How far was theto windward of the?
Two Cables length.
To windward or a-head?
Upon her Weather-bow, to windward and a-head.
Was she as much farther from the Enemy?
Yes.
When you fired the Guns from your Ship, could you see the?
No.
When you haul'd your Wind, did thedo so too?
I can't be positive; I did not observe; but when theMasts were gone, she was to windward.
During what Time did you see the?
I was most of the Time upon the Quarter-deckand must have seen her often.
At what Ship did you fire your Guns?
At the.
Did you fire any at the SternmostShips?
No.
When you haul'd off, did thedo so too?
I can't say.
Did you observe thebear down nearer than you at first?
Yes.
Did she ever bear down nearer than that?
Not till the Admiral wore.
Did the Shot reach you from the Enemy?
Yes, at the first of the Engagement.
Was thethe next Ship to you?
Yes.
If thehad bore down at first, might not she have engaged the?
It was in her Power, there was Wind enough.
How long did you keep firing at the?
Till after theMasts were gone.
Did your Shot reach?
I think not.
Did their Shot reach you?
Yes, at first; but we kept hauling off; and when thelost her Masts we left off firing.
Was there any Ship for theto engage, if she had come down at first?
Not unless she had gone to the.
Was thefiring upon the?
She fired sometimes.
If you had commanded the, do you think it would not have been better to have engaged the Ships coming up, than to have gone to engage theand assist the?
That was not a proper Question, we can best judge of that.
Did you see any of my Shot fall short?
No, I never saw any.
Were the five Sail coming up, to leeward of their Admiral?
I believe, rather to leeward, but very little.
When you saw theandengaging, were they to leeward of the Admiral and?
No.
Were they near one another?
No.
If theShips had held the Course they came up when theandwere engaging them, could not they have weather'd the?
I believe they could have gone very near to have done it.
As thewas at first under your Lee-quarter, how came she afterwards to be so far to leeward of you; was it by your hauling off, or her bearing away?
I can't judge of that.
Was theengaging the five Sail, and between them and the Fireship, when the Fireship blew up?
She was not immediately between them.
Was thea-head stemming for the Fireship, when the Fireship blew up?
I can't say.
Was thenearer the Fireship than the five Ships?
They were nearer when the Fireship blew up.
Did they pass me?
I can't say.
As these Ships came up to annoy the Fireship, I must have stop'd them?
When thewas engaging those Ships, were they upon her Quarter, or upon her Beam?
Rather upon her Quarter.
I think you say my Shot fell short?
I did not say so.
Where was you quartered?
Upon the lower Gun-deck.
Did you see thewhen she first haul'd up?
Yes.
Was she in a Line with the Admiral?
No, to windward.
Did you ever see theengaged?
Yes, she fired.
At what Time was it?

Yes.
Did theassist her?
No.
When the Fireship bore away, did theassist her, or cover her from the Enemy?
No.
Was she never within point-blank?
Not till we wore.

No.
How far to windward of the Line?
A Mile.
How far was thefrom you?
Better than a Quarter of a Mile.
Was thea Quarter of a Mile to leeward or a-stern of you?
To leeward.
Could thehave engaged theif she had bore down properly?
To be sure.

Thewas between, but she was to windward.
If thehad bore down to the, must not she have shot a-head of theand?
Yes, but they were to leeward.

Half an Hour, or three quarters of an Hour.
Did she fire at the?
Yes.
When these Ships came up, was thein a proper stationto engage the headmost of them?
No, she fired, and her Shot all fell short.

How many of them?
All the five.
Were they all nearer the Fireship than thewas?
I think they were.
When the Admiral wore, were the five Ships a-breast, a-head, or a-stern of the?

Upon the Gun-deck.
When thebegan to engage, how was thefrom her?
Half a Mile upon her Weather-bow.

No.
Where was you quartered?
Upon the Fore-castle.

Half an Hour.
What did thedo afterwards?
She did not bear down with us.
What past in your hailing the?
Our Captain hailed several times, then Captaincame into his Starboard-Gallery; our Captain asked why they did not bear down nearer? Captainturn'd round, but said nothing that I heard.
Do you think that Captainwas then within Gun-shot of the Enemy?
Within random Shot he might.
Repeat the Words that past on your hailing.
When our Captain hailed, Captaincame into his Starboard-Gallery, he said, what do you say? Captainsaid, Why don't you edge nearer, Captain? or Words to that effect. Captainturn'd round, and went out of his Gallery into his Cabin.
When you hailed thedid she bear down?
No.
Did you hear CaptainWords distinctly, What do you say, Captain?
Yes.
When you were engaging the four Ships, was Captainwithin a proper Distance of the Enemy?

I can't tell whether it was after or before hailing, that we bore down singly.

No.

Most of the four.
How far did the Headmost shoot a-head of you, before the Admiral made the Signal to leave off Chace and wore?
I don't remember whether she was before our Beam or not; if she was before our Beam, it was as much as she was.
What Sail did they come up with?
Top-gallant-sails, Top-sails, and Fore-sails; some had their Top-gallant-sails down, and some not.
Did they shorten Sail, or alter their Course upon your firing?
I don't remember they did, they edged away a little more.

I can't tell.
How far to windward of you?
A Cable's length upon our Bow.
Did you see thefire then?
Yes.
At what Ship?
I can't say.

A Point and a Half or two Points upon our weather Bow?
Was theever within Point-blank?
I believe not till we wore in the Evening.
Did you see the Fireship go down?

Thewas the nearest when the Fireship was coming down.

How did these Ships come up, with the Wind large?
Two or three Points from the Wind.
How cou'd I have engaged those Ships till they came a-head of the?
You cou'd not.
Were those Ships in a Line with their Admiral?
Them seem'd to come up to close the Line with their Admiral.
Were they in a Line with their Admiral?
The Admiral was further to windward than they.
Did they come up as you did?
They edg'd away more than we did.
If Captainand I had bore away further than we did, before we brought up, wou'd not those Ships have shot us away to leeward of them?
Had we gone down as close as the Admiral anddid, if those Ships had had a Mind, some, if not all of them might have weatherd us.
Where did the Single Ship go to that you engaged?
I can't tell.
It is very odd, if you engaged a Ship an Hour, that you don't know where she went to; pray recollect your-self.
I know there was a Single Ship distant from the four which we engaged.
Did I engage as soon as I had any Ship to engage with?
I don't remember what Ship you engaged with, I saw you fire.
Did you ever see me haul off from the Enemy or endeavour to get nearer?
I never saw you endeavour to get nearer from your first hauling up.
Did I haul off?
You seem'd to keep the same Position.
Where was the Shot that you receiv'd in your Main Mast, was it the Aftermost part or one Side?
Between the two Cheeks in the Aftermost part.
Did not that Shot come from the Ship a-stern of you?
It was either from the sternmost of the Enemy, or that next to her as I believe, I am not positive.
How cou'd I get between them to fire upon them till they got out of the Way?
I don't know whether we did not receive that Shot in the hauling off, we might receive it then.
Upon your hauling off did you get your Fore-Tack on board, haul your Mizen out, and haul your Wind till you got to windward of my weather Beam?
I do not remember we got our Weather-Tack aboard till we wore.
Did you ever see me yaw Ship, put my Sails a-back in order to open the Enemy's Ships, and bring my weather Guns to bear?
I saw you once bring to.
Did I ever fire my weather Guns?
I can't say you did.
Did you ever see me yaw Ship, put the Helm sometime Port, sometime Starboard, and lay my Sails back?
I did not observe you did.
How long did you fire before I began?
Some time; I can't remember how long.
As these Ships were under their Topsails, Topgallant sails and Foresails, they must have soon pass'd you; did I not engage them then?
I can't say; the headmost just came before our Beam, I saw her firing.
Did you see any of her Shot fall short?
Yes, and several of your Shot fell short of her.
How far was I from the Enemy when you saw me fire?
Less than a Mile.
Was I within a Cable's Length of you?
Yes.

No, I saw none pass till we wore.
What side of the Deck did Captainstand on when he hail'd the?
Upon the Weather side of the Quarter-Deck.
All I know of her is, that the three Ships a-stern of themade an Angle to windward of the Line, thewas the leewardmost, theto windward of her, theto leeward of the; I did not see them till after two, when thewas out of Action; I did not see any thing more.
When theengaged, how did thebear from her?
I can't tell.
Did you see thewhen her Masts fell?
Yes.
Did you see the, or any of the other Ships a-stern, assist her?
No, they all then made the Angle, and were in the Position I mentioned.
Were they firing then?
I saw them firing once, but can't tell whether it was then or no.
Did you see the Fireship go down?
Yes.
Did you see her blow up?
No, but I saw her Combustibles in the Air.
Did any of those Ships go down with her?
I did not see any of them go down with her, but they went down after her.
How long after her?
The Admiral was wearing then, and they all bore down with him.
When you saw theto leeward of the other Ships, was thedisabled, or what was the Reason she did not bear down?
I can't say what might be the Reason.
Was there Wind enough?
Yes.
When thewas engaging the second Ship a-stern of theAdmiral, where were the otherShips?
A long Way a-stern, and to Windward of every Ship of AdmiralDivision.
Are you sure of that?
Yes, it is plain they were to Windward, because I was to Leeward of the,,and, and I saw those Ships to Windward of them.
At what time?
At two, and half past two, and at three: AdmiralDivision engaged them to windward of our Line at three, and when Mr.Division neared them, they edged away towards their Admiral.
Was Mr.Division to windward of the Admiral's?
Yes.
