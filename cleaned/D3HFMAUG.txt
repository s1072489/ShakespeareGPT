Sir, I hope you'l
excuse mee, if I make
bold to aske you one 
question.
 What is't Lady?
 Are you not a Frenchman?
 Yes, Lady, at your service.
 I believe I have seene you

Gentleman?

company very often.
 He is a very welcomGentleman to all companies.

thought you had beene 
a naturall 
French-woman.
 It is impossible for an
English-woman to get
your Language 
perfectly.
 Excuse me, Lady, there 
are many that have 
done it.
 I had the honour not
long since, to converse
with a Gentlewoman
that speaks as exactly as
any French woman.
 I perceive you have a
great desire to the
French Tongue.
 Very great.
 You give the Accent very
right and exactly.
 Of whom doe you learn?
 Of a French man that is
newly come over, one of
Blois.
 'Tis true, the purest french
is spoken there, not onlyin respect of the
Pronunciation, but of the
phrase also.
 All the world confesse as 
much.
 Your language is very 
hard.
 I would speak as well as
you.
 Lady, but that I fear I
should take you off
from your more serious
imployment, I would
return your visite.
 Sir, when you please.
 How doth he teach you?
 What method doth he 
use?
 He teacheth me in a
discoursive way.
 If I were in, I
would learn by
keepingcompany at
Meetings.
 I knew a Countesse atthat spoke the
language so well, that
they admired her at 
Court.
 I have the honour to be
known to her.Is it not the Lady &c?
 She speaks all sorts of 
languages.
 She hath gotten her self a 
great name.
 She hath learnt a long
time.
 How long have you been 
in?
 Three years.
 You speak good English 
then.
 I protest to you, Lady, I
cannot beat it into my
head.
 Who is the best Master of 
the Languages in this 
City?
 Every man commends his 
own.
 Doe you play upon the
Lute?
 No Sir, I play upon the 
Virginals.
 Doe you learn to dance
too?
 I have learnt, but I shall
learn no more now.
 Lady, let me beg the
favour to hear you read
two or three words.Sir, I pronounce very ill.
 That's no matter, do me
this favour.
 Sir, I am ashamed.
 I beseech you deny me not
this favour.
 Your command shall serve
me for an excuse.
 You read it exactly well.
 I cannot flatter my self 
with any such vain
thought; I wish I could
do so.
 Really, Lady, you have
the true pronunciation 
of.
 Are you able to write a 
Letter in? 
 Yes, poorly.
 You are very much 
improved.

you?
 Hee never failes of his
time.
 Do you understand a 
Historie well?

 Can you tell a story well?
 Doe you understand all
that you read?

part.

sense well?
 Very well, Sir.
 Every body speaks French
at your house.

been in, and.
 What do you think of ourCountry, Sir?
 It is the pleasantest
Country in.
 I confess the civill
government is better observed
here then in. 
 You have many handsome 
women here.
 So have you in.
 The English herein excell
all other Nations.
 Sir, they are very much
obliged to you.
 If you should say so much
of any French women,
they would be hardly
of your opinion.
 I have told them as much
to their faces a hundred
times.

 Neare Covent-garden.
 There is the best company
in all.
 In what street.

 Wee discoursed together
in French two hours at

 I believe he is a 
Gentleman.
 He is a man of very good
behaviour, & discourses

 Exceeding well.

 Yes Sir, but I believe it was
but by way of
Complement.
 I can assure you, your
pronunciation is admirable.

of?
 The French Tongue.
 Did you understand him
well?
 As well as if he had spoke 
English.

 Very affable.

 As well as any French 
woman.
 Pray Sir, correct me where

 Very well.
 You encourage me.
 I was discouraged
yesterday.
 Have you any store of 
Schollers?
 Yes, very many.
 What doe they give you a 
moneth?
 No less then you do.

what money you lay

 To morrow, at my usuall
houre.
 I pray you fail not.

to buy for you.
 I give you a thousand 
thanks.
 What did it cost you?
 Sir, I shall give you your

raised a very great
opinion in mee of a certaine

teach her.
 Doth she speak so well?
 She speaks as well as any
Lady in the Court.
 You make me wonder 
very much.
 Is it possible that anEnglish VVoman should 
speak so well?
 Why not?
 You pronounce more
exactly then your English
men do.
 Were I in, I should
have some hopes of
learning; but here I see
no probability of it.
 You may learn as wel here
if you be taught by an
able Master. Lady, your servant.
 Lady, I am yours.
 Excuse my boldnesse, that
I take the liberty to
speakto you.
 Where there is no fault, 
there needs no excuse.
 I have been told, that you
speak extreamly well.
 I have heard the same of 
you.
 For my part, I am so
conscious of my own 
insufficiency, that I cannot
believe any such thing.
 Who told you this?I was yesterday in some
company where I heard
it.
 Those Gentlemen, or
those Ladies should
have spared my
ignorance.
 But they say you have
very great command of
the French tongue.
 As the French say,.
 By what I find, you speak
much better then I do.
 I protest to you, I have
the same opinion of
you.
 Do you believe that
Monsieur &c. speaks well?
 He's no Master of the
Language, but he makes
a good shift.
 Hath he the right
pronunciation?
 No, he hath onely what
he hath learnt of
himself.
 It is good to practise
somtimes, for fear of
forgetting.
 I do not fear that at all.

the time he hath learnt.
 He hath learnt a great
while.
 He hath not the right
pronunciation.

 There is great advantage 
gotten by conversing

singing, dancing, speaking
French and Italian,.You have scarce learnt any
thing at all.
 I am much vext at you.
 Your sister is farre beyond
you.
 Your Cousin has learnt
not above two moneths
and yet she speaks 
better then you.
 I have done my endeavor.
 I can doe no more then I 
have done.
 It's no fault of mine.
 I have a very bad memory.
 I hope Sir, you'l pardon
me.
 I shall endeavourto
satisfie your expectation in 
other things.
 Were you atwhen
that was done?
 Yes, I was.
 Is there any room in your
School?
 Yes.
 Speak French with your 
sister.
 I command you to talke 
French with her every
day.
 Father, will it please you
to hear me read?With all my heart, but
dip in your Booke, and
read.
 Turne mee that into
English.
 I do not understand it.
 I understand it very well.
 I doe not well conceive
what the sense of it is.
 I pray you help me.
 Your pronounciation is
good enough.
 You have spent your time
very well.
 Do all the Gentlewomen
of your Schoole speake
well?
 They speake excellently 
well. Madam, I hope you'll
excuse my boldness.
I was born to be a trouble
to you.
 I thank you a thousand 
times.
 You visit the poor.
 I wonder I could never see
you.
 I thought I had lost you.
 Madam, I confesse I ought
to have discharged my
selfe of my Obligations
to you, all other
businesse set aside.
 I know your goodnesse to
be such, that you could
not forget me.
 Where have you been all 
this while?
 I have not beene out of.I thought you had been in 
the Country.
 No, I was never out of
Town.
 Does not M=ris=.and
you meet sometimes.
 No, I have forsaken her
company, she's a very
ill-tongu'd, proud,
prating Gossip.
 I am of your humour, I
cannot away with such
kinde of people.
 You two were very great
once.
 I did not know her so well
then.
 They say she's a 
Gentlewoman of very good
discourse.
 Yes, at first, but afterwards
you'l quickly finde how
weak she is.
 They say, she's to be
married.
 'Tis quite broke off, ther's
no more talk of it now.
 What Portion hath she?
 Two thousand pounds.
 What's that? she lives
very high.
 She is very fantasticall.They say, she sings rarely.
 Excuse me, she has a very
harsh voice.
 Shee passes for the best
singer in.
 Yes, when ther's none but
she.
 Did you ever heare her
sing?
 A hundred times, her voice 
is gone.
 Who taught her?
 Mr..
 He is a good Teacher.
 He hath made many good
Schollers.
 Hee hath a good way of
teaching.
 I know a Gentlewoman,
that is a Scholler of his,
that sings very well.
 There are many better
Teachers then he.
 He is not the Phoenix.
 He hath a kinde of
roughnesse in his voice.
 For my part I know not,
I have heard all about
the Towne, but in my
judgment he is the best.
 He's much bound to you.
 That does not follow.He may be a good 
Musician, and yet have some
bad Schollers.
 All people are not alike
capable.
 Shee talks too much.
 Ther's no end of her talk.
 People laugh at her.
 Shee pretendes to know
much, but understands 
nothing.
 She's much given to
contradiction, you cannot
speak a word, but she'll
presently take you up.
 She's very gallant.
 She goes like any
Countesse.
 The Countesse of,is
not so richly clad.
 She pretends to be a great
Polititian.
 Shee understands nothing
at all.
 She has studied
Romances, more then Politicks.
 She is not very handsome.
 She paints horribly.
 Shee mindes nothing else
but tricking up her selfe.
 She goes like a Queen.She thinks no body
worthy to wipe her shooes.
 She is something low.
 I have heard so.
 She is much courted.
 She is a Gentlewoman of
quality, 'tis only her
ambition undoes her.
 They say M=r=.is a 
Suitor to her.
 So I heare too, but I
beleive he's too wise to
looke after such a 
talking Gossip.
 I have heard she dances as
well as any Master.
 She dances but ordinarily.
 Her dancing is not so
excellent.
 They say, she has a good
wit.
 'Tis true, but she knowes
not how to use it.
 Shee is wholy given to
vanities.
 She often visits my Cosen.
 They are never asunder.
 There is a great league
betwixt them.They have but one heart.
 Hath she not a Sister?
 Yes, & one that is a 
thousand times handsomer,
and wiser then she.
 Do they agree well?
 No, the Elder is jealous of
her Sister.
 Vertue always meets with
those that envy it.
 Is her Sister a finer
Gentlewoman then she?
 Ther's no compare betwixt 
them.
 Ther's as much difference
betwixt them, as betwixt
day and night.
 Where is her Brother?
 They have sent him into.
 How long since?
 A good while ago.
 What newes d'yee heare?
 They say all things are in
a combustion.
 Have you it from any
good hand?
 Yes.
 Thats ill newes.
 Do you take that man to
be a Politician?He's as politick as a childe
of two yeares old.
 He's a very simple fellow.
 Is he alwaies at the french
Court?
 He will never quit that.
 He's a man of a bad life.
 He is highly promoted.
 Hee is very happy for a
time.
 If it will but hold.
 Bad men have but a time.
 GOD sometimes suffers
wicked men to prosper
for a time.
 I beleive that man has
intelligence from all parts
of the World.
 He holds correspondence
with the States of,.is quite undone.
 It is great pity.
 I would not be there now
for any thing.
 They say, thatis a
very exorbitant place.
 They say, 'tis very ill
governed.
 God be thanked, our
governement iseasie 
enough.Whither went you t'other 
day in a Coach?
 I went into theCountry,
to see M=rs=..
 She's a gallant 
Gentlewoman.
 She's the most accomplisht
Gentlewoman in.
 Shee's not very well in
health.
 Shee's something out of
temper.
 She's a gallant Lasse, and a 
very merry Soule.
 Is not M=r=.a Servant
of hers.
 She's no match for him.
 He's too debosht.
 She will not heare of him.
 She has variety of servants.
 Does hee visit her
sometimes?
 Very seldome.
 She gives him but cold
entertainment.
 M=r=,hath a minde to

 I beleive he'll be the man.
 Does his Father like well
of it?
 He mightily likes the 
businesse.What saies her other 
Servant?

Gentlewoman.

Souldier, and well
beloved.
