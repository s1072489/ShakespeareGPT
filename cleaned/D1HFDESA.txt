Ho Fraunces rise, and get you to schoole: you shalbe beaten, for it is past seuen: make your self readi quickly, say your prayers, then you shall haue your breakefast. Margerite, geeue mee my hosen: dispatche I pray you: where is my doublet? bryng my garters, and my shooes: geeue mee that shooyng horne. Take first a cleane shirte, for yours is fowle. Make hast then, for I doo tarie too long. It is moyst yet, tary a litle that I may drie it by the fier. I cannot tary so longe: go your way, I will none of it. Your mother will chide mee if you go to schoole without your cleane shirt. I had rather thou shouldst be shent, then I should be either chid, or beaten: where haue you layde my girdle and my inckhorne? where is my gyrkinof Spanish leather? of Bouffe? Where be my sockes of linnen, of wollen, of clothe? Where is my cap, my hat, my coate, my cloake, my kaape my gowne, my gloues, my mittayns, my pumpes, my moyles, my slippers, my handkarchif, my poyntes, my sachell, my penknife and my bookes? Where is all my geare? I haue nothyng ready: I will tell my father: I will cause you to be beaten: Peter, bring me some water to wash my hands and my face. I will haue no riuer water, for it is troubled: geue mee Well, or Fountayne water: take the ewre, and powre vppon my handes: powre high. Can you not wash in the baason? shall you haue alwayes a seruaunt at your tayle? you are to wanton. Wilt thou that I wash my mouthe and my face, where I haue washed my handes, as they doo in many houses in England? geue mee a towell: mayden, now geue mee my breakefast,for I am readie: make haste. Haue you saluted your Father and your Mother? haue you forgotten that? Where is he? He is in the shoppe. God geeue you good morow my father, and all your companie: father geeue mee your blessyng if it please you. Are you vp? is it time to rise at eight of the clocke? you shalbe whipt: go, and kneele downe, and say your prayers: God blesse thee. Our father which art &c.
Now goe, and haue mee recommended
vnto your maister and maistris,
and tell them that I pray them
to come to morow to dinner with mee:
that will keepe you from beating:
learne well, to the end that you may
render vnto mee your lesson when you are
come againe from schoole. Well father.
 God geeue you good morow gossip.
 And you also: how doo you
this morning? How doth my gossip?
 wel God be praysed: at your co~mandme~tHow is it w=t= you since yesternight supper?
 Well thankes be to God, sauyng that I
could not sleape all the night.
 Why? who hath letted you?
 What, haue you not heard the
minstrels and players of instruments,
which did play so sweetly before
the Cities stoarehouse, from midnight
euen vnto the breakyng of the day?
 Truly I haue not heard them.
 Verely you sleap very deepe.
 As he whiche sleapeth without care,
& which had drunk very wel yesternight.
 But to the purpose, which were those
singers and players of instruments?
 I cannot tell truely: except perchaunce
they were the minstrels of the towne,
with those of the Queenes, mingled
with voyces of Italions and Englishme~,
which did singe very harmoniously.
 Would God I had heard them,
and it had cost mee a quarte of wyne.
 I would you had for your sake:
for it would seeme vnto you to be rauished
in an yearthly paradise:
you had heard first and formostthe Violes, Cornets, Harpes, Hobois,
Trumpets, with foure Flutes
the which did triumphe.
 Is it true? in whose name did they play?
who had hyred them?
 The best of the citie, to pla~te the maipole
at the marketplace.
 But should it not be for some weddinge?
for the daughter of one of the sheriffes
of the citie is maried to daie.
 That may be: but so it is y=t= the may Pole
is planted verie sumptuouslie.
 Let vs go and see it if you will.
I am conte~t of it: let vs go when you wil.
 What musick doo I heare there at the
lanes ende? is it not some weddinge?
 It is the bride of whom I haue tolde you
 Truelie it is a faire wenche, though
her hed bee ill dressed: doo you see
the faire carkant whiche she hath hanging
on her neck?
 But do you see the faire chain of gold
whiche she hathe girded aboute?
 I think y=t= it is worthe aboute fiue hu~dred
frenche crownes.
 Where is the briedgrome? ah I see himthere at the middestof the great streete.
 Truly he is a fayre gentilman:
it doth appeare by his behauiour that
he is of a good house, and of great vertue.
 Whether go they? to Churche, or to
some great Lordes house?
 They go to y=e= Church of Saint Paule.
 What is a clocke?
 It is almost nine.
 What, is it so late? Yea truly.
 It is time to go to the Churche.
 Let vs go see that Mariage, and then
wee will go to heare the sermon
at Paules crosse.
 There shalbe no let for mee: for I haue
heard say that a yonge batcheler
of diuinitie, which is very well learned,
shall preache to day at the crosse.
 I beleeue it well: for there preacheth
no body but is of choyce, and of
great learning: and for cause.
 I doo thinke that they be y=e= best sermons
that men may heare in all the
rest of the Realme of England.
 And of those which be made before the
Queenes maiestie in the time of Lent,what say you of it?
 You say true: those be of weight:
but one must not meruell at,
for the Preachers be warned of
longe time before: so by that meane
they be sermons premeditated.
 Is it not better to take
a deliberation before hand, then to
come to the Pulpit rashly?
 I confesse it: for men doo see all
Sundayes and holy dayes a great
& a noble company in Pauls churchyeard.
beholde the church is all full of folkes:
how shall wee enter in?
 Enter you first, and I wil follow you:
thrust hard, & cause the way to be made.
 Harken, I doo heare a sweet musick:
I neuer heard the like.
 See whether wee may get to the quier,
and wee shall heare the fearest voyces
of all the cathedrall churches
in England.
 I beleeue you: who should haue them,
if the Londonners had them not?
 I thinke that the Queenes singyng men
are there, for I doo heare her baase.That may be: for, to tell the trueth,
I neuer heard better singyng.
 Harken, there is a good versicle.
 I promise you that I would heare them
more willingly singe, then eate or drinke.
 I am not of your minde: for mee
thinketh that I would heare them more
liuely, if I had well dined: but
wee doo tarie heare to longe: let vs go
and take our roume that wee may heare
the Sermon: shall wee go?
 I am content: how shall wee get out?
 Wel enoughe: follow mee: here is great
prease: I neuer saw such a multitude.
 Where shall wee sit? all is full:
all the formes be occupied.
 Wee will finde place enough, care you
not for that: let mee alone.
 Sit hard by, and right ouer against
the preacher, y=t= wee may heare him better.
 I will doo it if I may: William,
I pray you sit a side a litle, and
make vs some roume here by you.
 With a very good will Syr.
 What Lorde is that, whiche is aboue in
the Galerie?Doo you not know him? No truly.
 It is my Lorde of Bedford: and that
Lady which sitteth by him,
is my Lady thadmirall, the dutchesse
of N: the countise of N: the marquise
of N: My Lady Tresorer.
 Doo you know those gentleweme~, which
be behinde? Yea, as mee thinketh:
is it not maystris N. and
maistris of N: with their
two nices and coosins? Yea.
 Beholde the Preacher commeth:
shall wee helpe to singe this Psalme?
 I cannot singe, except I doo learne:
now, the sermon is almost ended:
let vs rise to get out first:
let vs not tarie for the prese.
 As it pleaseth you: I will doo all
that you will.
 By your leaue: let me go by
I pray you. With all my harte.
 Well gossip, whither go you to dinner.
 At home.
and you where dine you?
 At maister chauncelours of London:
he hath bidden mee aboue a fortnight a go.
 Truly wee shall dine together.I thanke you hartely gossip:
you shall scuse mee for this time if it
pleaseth you, for hee and I haue to
confer together touchyng some businesse.
 I pray you doo not denie it mee
at this time: doo an other time as
you shall thinke good: as it wil please you.
 I feare that he will take it in an euell
parte, if I doo deceaue him at this howre.
 No, no: I will make your scuse to him:
he knoweth mee very well: he and I
haue been schoolefellowes
at the Colledge of Winchester.
 Is not that your lackey which crosseth
the streete? except I be deceaued, it is he.
 Yea verely: call him.
 Lackey, come hither.
 What is your pleasure Syr?
 Whither go you? whither run you
so fast? it seemeth that you haue neither
woon nor lost.
 I went to seeke you: for those that
you bad yeesterday be at home
which doo tarie for you a good will a go.
 Hath no body asked after mee since
I departed?I cannot tell, Sir, because I haue
not been at home till now.
 Where haue you been so longe?
 My maistris hath sent mee on two
or three arands.
 You haue played by the way, and then
you bryng to mee these feare scuses.
 No forsoothe, Sir, if it
doth please you to aske of N. you
shall know the truth, for he was
with mee.
 Yea verely, I shall aske of thy fellow,
which is as great a liar
as thou art: is thy maistresse at
home.
 Yea, Sir, she is now
come from the Churche.
 Is the seruice doone in our parish?
 It is already a good halfe hower:
and it is neere twelue at our clocke.
 Runne before, and say that wee come:
see that the dinner be reddie when
wee bee come, and without a faute:
draw som wine in y=e= mean time, go quicklie.
 You haue there a pretie boy,
and quicke of wit.I promise you y=t= I will draw out more
seruice of that boye, then of three seruants
which will doo nothyng els then to make
greate cheere, and play at dice and cardes.
 There be some, to tell y=e= trothe, which be
very slougish: and as men say commonly,
he is happie which hath a good
seruant, and a good wife.
 What noyse doo I here there within?
 Knock at y=e= doore: knock hard, or els they
wil not heare it: pul the bel for the best.
 Truly I saw it not.
 Who is there?
 Open the doore: I thinke that you are
deafe: where is my wife?
 She is within, syr.
 Wife, shall wee go to dinner?
wife, shal wee dyne?
 When it will please you my louer: al is
ready: the meate mareth: where haue you
taried so longe? you come not now
from the Churche, that know I well, for
it is twelue stroken.
 Go to: let vs go to dinner: let vs go sit.Go cause the folke to sit which are
in the Haule: and I go to the kitchin
to cause to serue the boorde.
 Make speede then I pray you, for truly
I am hungrie: masters, you bee
all welcome: I am sorie that
I make you tarie so longe.
 No force, Sir?
wee doo warme vs in the meane while:
come neere the fier: come warme you.
 Truly I am more hungry then a colde:
go too, let vs wash handes.
 Wash you first, I will wash 
afterward well enough.
 Let vs wash al together I pray you:
 Sir, what doo you there? wash with vs
 As for mee I haue washed.
 And I haue handled nothing since that
I haue washed. Sit then, Syr.
 Pardon mee of that: it shalbe after you:
sit you first, I will sit afterwarde.
 You shall sit there: haue I not power
to commaunde in my house?
 Yes forsoeth, Syr.
 When I bee at yours, doo with mee
as it shall please you.You say well: go to then, sit downe here
by this yonge gentelwoman.
 Well, by commaundment I will doo it,
although it be half agaynst my will.
 There is no remedy: you must obey for
this time: page, call the children
for to blesse the boorde: rynge the bell.
 It is ronge. Bryng vs some meate.
 Iames. What is your pleasure mother?
 Where are you? why went you not 
to meete your father, and your vnckle?
I will tell your maister: I will cause you
to be beaten: go quickly say grace,
and take your sister by the hande:
take of your cappe, and make curtsie.
 Wel mother, I go thither: you are
welcome father, and all your companie.
 Where haue you been wa~ten? one must
alwayes call and seeke you when
one should say grace: pray vnto God.
 Our good Father almightie, &c.
 Is that your sonne Syr?
 Yea, it is my sonne. It is a fayre childe
God blesse him, & make him a good man.
 Of what age is he? Nine yeres & a half.
 Doth he go to Schoole? God forbidhe should not: you know well that it
is better to be vnborne,
then vntaught.
 You say true: what doth he learne?
 He doeth learne to speake Frenche.
 Doeth hee? it is very well doone: Henry
can you speake good Frenche?
 Yea, a litle Syr.
 Whither go you to schoole?
 At Lewsham, hard by the Church.
 Haue you of longe time learned to
speake Frenche?
 Aboute half a yeere. Doo you learne also
to write? Yea Syr. What more?
The Latin tongue. It is wel done: learne
alwayes well: how doo men call your
Maister? He is called. Is he maried? Yea Syr.
 Hath hee any children?
 He hath a sonne and a daughter.
 What countreima~ is hee? A Frenchman.
 I am glad of it: you wil learne y=e= better
the true and liuely pronounciation and
phrase of the frenche tongue.
 Very well, it is talke enough: now eate,
and make good cheere: you shall talkeafter dinner and at leasure.
 Beginne in the meane while: go 
thorow and doo not tarie for mee: for I haue
very well broken my fast this mornyng:
I take a great delight to talke with this
yonge boye: is this your daughter also?
 Yea gossip.
 Truly it is a feare gerle:
she will cost you nothyng toward her
mariage: she wilbe maried for her
beautie and good grace.
 Yea truly, you say well: she is a fayre
blacke one: take your spectakels, and
looke a litle neerer: doo you mocke?
 No truly: I haue not put on my 
mocke.
 Ione, is the childrens table couered?
 Not yet maistresse.
 Bryng their round table: and make the~
dine there at the bordes ende: reade a
chapter or two of the new Testament,
whilst they make ready your table.
 Peter, where is the booke? What booke?
 Where I read yesterday. Doo you
not see it? are you porblind? it will
put out your eyes, except you take heede:it is there vpon the pulpit.
 Father where shall I reade? Wher you
left yesterday, at the seconde of S. Iohn.
 Is it in the reuelation, in his Epistles, or
in his Gospell?
 Where you will.
 There is a fayre chapter truly: god geue
vs grace to doo the contence therof:
hold there, it is enough: marke it with
a litle incke: you make great haste:
you cannot reade moderatly:
your nose is in the kitchin I see it
well enough: it seemeth to your belly
that you haue lost your teeth:
now go to dinner.
 I cannot tel what faute you finde in it
gossip, but he readeth very distinctly
for his age.
 What, is not the childrens table
couered yet? what doest thou there
great lubber? why goest thou not
and serue the children?
 They bee two or three about it Syr.
 Who? Their lackey and their
chamberlayne: maister lackey truly you
shalbe whipped to day:you doo licke here the disshes in the
kitchin, lookyng if the roast be roasted,
and taste if the sauce is saulted: and
serue not your litle maister: who
hath drawen the lard out of these rabbets?
It is not I.
 You lie: go your wayes, you are
lickerish: O Lorde, he hath supped vp all
the brothe of this mince pie, I would not
be in thy skinne for twentie
crownes of golde.
 I know not where the table clothe lieth
neither the childrens napkins.
 No, but thou knowest well where the
fat of the pot is, and the sauciges in
the droppyng panne: thou shalt be beaten
thine belly full after dinner, be of good
cheere: and ye shalbe tremmed euen
vnder the belly, and euery where, beleeue
mee if thou wilt.
 You threaten much, who shall
whip mee?
 Who? the mayster steward.
 Wilt thou go lay the table clothe vile
gallowes? what dost thou marre here?
 What can I tell where it lieth, go yourselfe.
 It is vpon the cubbord, or within the
drawer: holde, carie these trenchers
and the saltseller.
 I dare not go before my maister,
for feare that he will chide mee.
 No force: thou hast not
onely deserued to bee shent, but
also to be well beaten.
 Lackey, from whence come you?
 I come from the kitchin beneathe.
 Very well, you are a cooke: well wee
will recken together after dinner:
I owe vnto you one, and this
makethtwo: I will pay you all
together, be sure of it: call vnto mee
the butlar.
 I am here Syr.
 Go set mee a broche the best
peece of wyne which is in the sellar:
Sirs, I pray you make good
cheere: yee bee welcome: cosin,
I drinke to you with such a good
hart as euer I did when I haue
been very drie.
 Truly I pledge you with such agood will as euer I came from
the schoole: doo you not beleeue mee?
 Yea, verely: I beleeue you without
any other swearyng: but doo mee
reason: drinke all out.
 What coosen, doo you not remember
Kynghis banket,
where euery one dranke as he listed,
and no body was constrayned?
 Oh, I crie mercie: pardon mee
if it pleaseth you: you haue stopped
my mouth: now for al amends
will you haue a bit of this pouder beef,
 As it shall please you: truly it is
very good: it is as tender and shorte
as Veneson: geeue mee some
mustarde.
 What sir, you loue Mustard
as I perceaue: it wil make you a 
red nose and a crimsin face.
 I wil blot it out w=t= a drauft of maumsie.
 By my faith it is a good meeter:
aske of what wyne it shall please you
to drinke, spare it not, the vynes
are faire: William, geeue here som bread:
take a ladder, and see what wantethvppon the boorde: you will neuer learne
to serue: why doo you not lead it
with a trencher plate, and not with
the hande? I haue told it to you aboue
an hundred times: you learne nothynge:
it is a great shame: holde, geeue this
platter of porage vnto the children, and
geeue them some spoones: Peter,
take vp my knife which is fallen vnder
the table.
 You doo nothyng but play the wanton
litle fellow: I will tell your father:
why doo you not eate your porage
whylste they be hot? you
are not hungrie.
 They are yet to hot: I haue burned my
tongue, and my lippes.
 If they be too hot, blow them.
 Are those your good manners to blow
your porage at the borde? where
haue you learned that? at your vilage?
geeue mee some drinke.
 Eate first a litle, for you
would be sicke: will you drinke fastyng?
 But I wil not bee: geeue mee some beere.
 Holde the pot: holde it well: you spill:doo not you see what you doo?
 I knew not that it was so full.
 Brother, is any thyng in the pot?
 Not very much: Iohn, fill
him som drinke.
 What will you drinke? ale, or
beere? why doo you not answer?
 Fill mee some beere in this pot:
fill this glasse: fill not so full:
fill no double beere, but
of the smalest, for I am very drie:
I cannot quenche my thirst.
 Husband, I pray you pull in peeces that
Capon, and help your neighbour:
truly he eateth nothyng.
 Tarie a litle wife, I haue not
yet tasted of these Cabeges.
 You cannot eate of them, for they
be to much peppered and salted.
 Ah, what pitie is that? it is the meate
that I loue best, and it is marred:
they say commonly in England
that God sendeth vs meate, and the 
Deuill cookes.
 My louer, tast a litle of these turneps,
and you will finde them of a good taste.I care not very much for:
are these rootes well seasoned?
 If you will eate of a good meate,
cut of that legge of mutton stuft
with garlicke.
 Geeue mee rather of that Capon
boyled with leekes: for I should smell of
garlicke three dayes after.
 Take away this boyld meat: now bring
vs the roaste: pull hither that
shoulder of Veale: it is very wel larded,
it prouoketh mee to eate truly: make
roume to set the disshes: set that a side
a litle: cut that Turkie cocke in
peeces: but let it be colde,
for it is better colde then hot:
Sir shall I bee your caruer?
 Yea forsooth Syr, on that condition that
I shalbe your cupbearer.
 Wee are agreed: will you haue this
Hennes wynge?
 As for mee I loue the white of the hen:
and you loue the roump.
 You are a scoffer, as I perceaue.
Peter, fill mee some wine.
 What wine will it please you to drinke?It is all one to mee: geeue mee
claret wine: put water in it, for it is
to stronge to drinke without water:
powre still: holde vp, it is enough.
 I will not drinke with you, for you
put to much water in your wine.
 I shall not be so soone droken.
 What? will you be dronken? will
you make your selfe droken?
 No, but it is the wine which maketh
mee dronke.
 The faute is not in the wine, but in
him which doth drinke it.
 I am glad to see you merie.
What? an once of mirth is better,
then a pounde of sorow,
yea, and make good weight.
 How would you weigh them?
 I wil tell it you, when I haue dronken:
geeue mee some wine, if there be any.
 There is no more. Is there no more?
go fetch some: is the seller so farre?
 Sir, I dranke yesterday of the best fre~ch
wine that is in all the
Tauerns of London. Where is that?
 At the signe of the Rose,at Temple barre.
 Let vs haue a quarte of it.
 I had rather that you should say
a pinte: what will a quarte serue among
so many? one must speake
of a gallon or two.
 Come hither Iohn, you will doo this
message wel: tel the good man of y=e= Rose,
that he will sende mee of such wine which
wee drank y=e= other daie at his lodging: & tel
him that if he doo not sende mee of the like
which I did taste in his sellar,
wee wil send it backe agayne: run quickly
are you there yet?
 I will not tarie: but by what
token?
 You neede no token: doo
onely that I bid you: 
he will not fayle, for he knoweth mee
very well.
 My Maister sendeth mee to you,
praying you to sende him
a flaggen of the best wine
that you haue.
 Who is your Maister my freend?
I know him not.Doo you not know him? he dwelleth
on th'otherside of y=e= street: he did drinke on
Saterday last with you in your seller.
 You say true: I remember it
now: William.
 What is your pleasure maister?
 Fill him his bottell with wine,
and of a fresh peece.
 Geeue mee your bottell: come with
mee into the seller, and you shall see it
perced: put a broche.
 See what you doo: you spill:
take the Fonnell: dispatche a litle
for I haue great hast: they tarie for mee.
 Holde, go your way: and tell your
maister that there is of the best y=t= I haue.
 Here is the wyne. What saieth hee?
Hee hath him commended to you, and
sendeth you the choyce, and the flower of
all his wines.
 Rince the glasse, that I may taste of it:
how like you this wine?
 I like it very well: I like him the better
for that he sente vs such good wine: hee
hath doon vnto mee y=e= turne of a good freend
 Geeue mee a cleane trencher: thesechickens are to much roasted: open that
Pastie of Veneson: this Doe was
very fat, was it not?
 Yea verely: it is
the fattest that I haue
yet seen this yeere.
 Bring vs some suggred Mustard
for our Veneson: Syr, doo not
mislike mee if I bee
bolde in your house.
 You cannot bee to bolde here,
I pray you commaunde as
if you were in your house,
and you shall doo mee pleasure.
 Geeue mee drinke in that Goblet.
 What, will you not haue vs to
see how much you drinke?
you are a subtel fellow, you will
deceaue folkes.
 Truly I did not thinke on it: you
imagine alwayes euell, where
no goodnesse is to bee had.
For what doo you laugh? wherof I laugh?
 He dooth laugh at your page which hath
supped vp a cup of wine, & then wipeth
his bill as if he hadnot touched on it.
 Doth hee not well? it is not the
first that hee hath swalowed vp: hee
knoweth well the trade of it.
 Maistresse, shall I geeue you some
crust of this pie?
 As it will please you: I am well God
be thanked.
 Mee thincketh that it is too much baakt.
 No forsoothe, it is but well:
but it is great pitie that
the licker is so runne out.
 It is the faulte of the baker: I would
that he had it in his belly.
 I woulde bee sory of it truly, for I
should lose. And I also, to tell the truth.
 Wyfe, haue wee nothyng els?
 Yea husband: are the blackebyrdes
rosted, the larkes, and the woodcockes?
set here this partrich larded.
 Coosin, if you will eate of a good
morsell, cut some of these loynes
of the hare, drest with a blacke sauce.
 Unckle, here is to much meate:
mee thinketh that wee bee at a weddyng.
 I doo heare some body which knockethat the doore: see who it is.
 Mighell, where bee the keyes?
 They hange on a nayle behinde y=e= doore.
 Who is there? They bee freendes:
open the doore: I haue been here
aboue halfe an houre: hath your
maister dined?
 Hee is not at the Fruit yet.
 Are there many folkes with him?
 Fifteen, or sixteen: what is your pleasur
what shal I say who asketh for him?
 Tel him that it is N.
 Come in Sir: come in gentilwoman:
Sir, there is a gentilman beneathe
which would fayne speake with you.
 Cause him to come in. Father, it is
my godfather, and my godmother.
 Ah lickerish, you know them well
by the cumfits, and lickerishnesse
which they geeue you.
 Gossyp, you are welcome:
and you also, my shee gossyp:
how doo you?
 So, so. Wherefore?
haue you been sicke?
 Yea, and of an euill sicknesse.What sickenesse hath taken you?
 Lackyng of money.
 Oh, take heede of that
disease, for lackyng of money is 
a payne which there is not the like:
I know it well: I haue prooued it:
but yet, what sickenesse haue you?
 None, God be thanked, at this present,
but the toothe ache: but I will
heale it as soone as I
shall come to my vitayles: so it is
notwithstanding, that I haue had an ague
a fortnight or three weekes
which hath much weakned mee, and I
feele yet some fit of it,
because I haue not broken my fast.
 Where haue you taried so longe?
from whence come you now?
truly you are to blame:
wee haue almost dined.
 Wee come from the court.
 What newes at the court?
doth the Kynge go to huntyng?
 Wee haue seen the Queen in her
coutche which cam from walkyng
out of the Parke: and as she went to thechappell to heare the seruice,
there was a Lady of the court
auncient enough, which hath presented her
a request: the Queene hath taken it
very gentely, truly, and hath geeuen
her her hand to kisse.
 Shee is a very courteous Princesse,
God preserue her longe vnto vs.
 So be it: truly it is a Lady
woorthy of a great prayse: shee hath
kept vs a longe time in peace and
tranquilitie: the which yee haue not
read in any chronicle of England,
that there hath been any Prince since the
conquest, which hath maintayned this
Realme in such a longe and good peace:
and if I should say since,
I should not lie.
 But in the meeane time make mee some
roume: you occupie more roume
then three others: doo you see what a
payre of buttockes he hath?
 It is well sayd, gossip, make them to go
backe, for you haue neede of it: I thinke y=t=
you haue a good stoomacke,
 So haue I truly: why should I lie?Will you sup some brothe?
 Bryng vnto him the broth of that capon
which I haue caused to be kept.
 Sirs, I pray you doo not tarie
for mee: follow your enterprise:
as for mee, I wil make a lawiers dinner.
 What doo you meane by that?
 Did you neuer heare speake of
hunters breakfast, lawiers dinner,
marchants supper, and drinkyng
of Moonkes? he which maketh all these
meales, doth hee not fare well?
 Where doth he take the sacke to thrust
in so much meate?
 He is worse then an.
 There be founde in y=e= world such guts.
 It is more pitie that there is no
more disciplin among men.
 Hee which hath two kniues, let him
lend mee one.
 Haue you no knife? No.
 Cut my finger, I geeue you
leaue, and I will not repent.
 You are an hardy man: you go
to the battell after the blowes are geuen:
George, lende mee your knife.It is not sharp: he cutteth nothyng:
I will go whet it.
 Geeue it mee, I will make it cut well enough
 Gossip, I thinke that you are
yet fastyng.
 What, should I fast so longe? I coulde
not surely: I haue dronken this morning
a draught of Maumsie, with a litle
toast: I haue dronke also some Muscadet.
 Elizabeth, take all away: geeue vs
the fruite.
Sirs, will you eate of a
Pike with a high dutche sauce?
what say you of a stued Carpe?
 Oh Syr, it is to much: it wold be excesse:
besides, you will put your self to
great coste.
 Care you not for the charges:
it is drest: set them vpon the boorde,
and eate of it who will.
 I thinke that this Carpe was an
ell longe: is it of your ponde?
 And that Pike, it is the greatest and
biggest that euer I see.
 Now serue the Fruite: laye herethose rosted paires, and the scrapped
cheese set those appels lower: they bee
pepins, as it seemeth vnto me:
did you euer see fearer pepins?
 I hold a penie
that it comethe out of Normandie.
 No no, it is growen in England:
these tartes bee cold, & the egges
pies also: maistris, will you haue
some cake? trulie it is but dow
I wold that the baker had been
backed when he did heate the ouen.
 But so it is that this wether shold
warne him to heate his ouen well,
for it is verie cold: it doth snow and
frisethe all together.
 It did raine nowe: Henry, go
fetch some wood and make good fier: bring
a busshell of coales. wel maister.
 Roland, shall we haue a song?
yea Sir: where bee your bookes of 
musick? for they bee the best corrected.
 They bee in my chest: Katherin take
the key of my closet, you shall find
them in a litle til at the left hand:
behold, therbee faire songes atfouer partes.
 Who shall singe with me?
 You shall haue co~panie enough: Dauid 
shall make the base: Iohn, the tenor:
and Iames the treble.
 Begine: Iames, take your tune:
go to: for what do you tarie?
 I haue but a rest.
 Roland, drink afore you begine,
you will sing with a better corage.
It is wel said: geue me some white wine:
that will cause me to sing clearer.
 You must drink greene wine. Yea trulie
to cause me to lose my voice.
 Oh, see what a fonell, for he hath powred downe
a quarte of wine without anie takinge
of his breath.
 I shold not bee a singing man except I could
drink well: and for feare wee shold haue
the throte drie, wee weat the
mouthe often: and among vs
singers, wee haue a good recepte
for to be neuer drie.
 What is it I praye you? I
wold faine learne it.
 I will teach it vnto you for a quarteof wine, is not that good cheape?
 Truly thou shalt haue two quartes,
and geeue it mee in writyng.
 You neede no writing in that: you
will remembre it well enough by harte.
 Say then I pray thee.
 For to quenche well the thirst, one must
drinke often, and longe draughtes.
 Is that thy receite? go, go
with a morion: I know that
aboue ten yeeres a go.
 I could not geeue you a better
phisicke then the same which I take for
my selfe.
 Thou hast a conscience as large as a
grea Friers sleeue: if I should doo
that, I shouldehaue the dropsie
before a monthes ende.
 And I, if I should not drinke, I should
become as drie as a ga~mon of Bacon hong
on a chimney: therefore your
nature and mine bee contrary:
and as I perceaue, you cannot
tell the songe which beginneth
I had rather go without hosen
then forbeare drinkyng.I praye thee let vs haue it.
 With all my harte.
 Truelie he is a merie fellowe.
 Leonard, ar the chestnutes rosted?
 Yea Sir. Geue them vppon the borde.
 Henry, rise, and your sister also:
what, you kepe table as long
as wee: serue here: and see
whether anie thing be wa~ting vpo~ y=e= bord
but I praye you cut that cheese:
you doo not make good cheere:
you are not merie: this
musick doth not make you merie.
 Yes forsoth: truelie I take a
great delight in it.
 There is a good song: I do
maruell who hath made it.
 It is the maister of the children
of the Queenes chapell.
 What is his name?
 Maister Edwards. Is he a liue?
I heard saie that he was dead.
 It is alreadi a good while a go: ther are at
the least fiue yeers and a half.
 Truelie it is pitie: he was a man
of a good wit, and a good poete:and a great player of playes.
 Well, hee is gon before,
wee shall follow him hereafter
when it will please God.
 Geeue mee that sheepe cheese:
will you haue of this frenche
Angelot? it is yet green.
 It is more deintie, as men doo say,
notwithstandyng I loue it not, because
it is so fat: it is but creame.
 Tast then of this parmison, or of
this Holland cheese.
 Where is my lackey? I did send him
to fetch some Renish wine, and I thinke
that he lieth by the way.
 Hee is come agayne: he drieth him
selfe in the kitchin, because hee is
wette.
 Doth it rayne? No Sir, but it doth
snow harde.
 I dare lay that he hath played with 
snow baules by the way:
I drinke vnto all the companie:
thanking you that you haue shewen
vnto mee so much curtesie as to haue come
to my house: I am sorie thatI am not able to make you
better cheere.
 Wee do thank you, Sir,
what better cheere could
you wishe?
 Take away the boord: & call the childre~
for to saie grace.
 George, take awaie this dish,
can you not?
 I can not retch to it. Awaye:
you can doo nothing: you are
good but to drink, eate and sleap.
 Father doth it please you that I saye 
grace?
 Tarie yet a litle that all
be taken awaie: now saie.
 To thee wee do geue thankes, &c.
 Now rehearse some faire
sayinge or sentence, that wee
maye see what you haue learned.
 What shall I saie father? a
sentence, a prouerb, a fable,
an epigrame or an apophthegme?
 Say what you liste.
 For one pleasure, a thousand sorowes.
 It is verie well and truelie said:you are a feare childe:
come neare to mee
that I may reason with you:
what booke doo you reade at schoole?
 My maister readeth vnto vsand, Syr.
 Who is the captayne of your
schoole?
 It is Henry Edmoundes.
 What, hee whiche did pronounce
an Oration before the Queenes
maiestie, when she was
now of late at?
 Yea Syr, it is hee.
 I know his father very well:
he is a good gentilman truly.
 Now, haue you talked longe enough
with that boy? let vs wash after dinner:
let vs wash all together I pray you:
Gentilwoman, come neare,
you are very straunge: I pray
you bee bolde here, as if
you were at your house, for
so are you: spare nothyng
that I haue, and you shal doo mee pleasure.
 I thanke you with all my hart:I knowe not when I shalbe able
to recompense you of such a
curtesie whiche you show me
dailie: I am here ordinarlie
at dinner and supper.
 It pleaseth you to saye so:
you can not come so often,
but you are the better welcome:
let vs go take the aire of the fier:
I beginne to wax cold: gossip,
what do you there? why come you
not nere the fier? page,
laie a faggot on the fier.
 Husband you will set the chemnie
on fier, except you take heede.
 I will not my she louer, for it is
therin alreadi.
 It is time to departe, for they haue
ronge twise to eueninge praiers.
 Haue you so great haste? let vs warme
vs first, and then
wee wellgo all together.
 By your leaue: wee will take our
leaue of you: thanking you
hartelie for our good chere.
 Will you be gone?Yea, if it pleaseth you.
 As it will please you.
 God geeue you a good and longe life
Sir.
A good & longe life God geeueth vnto you.
 God bee with you gossip till I see you agayne
 They bee gon.
 God bee their guide. God saue you Maister Robert.
 Sir, God geeue you a good and long lif.
 How doth your health since
I saw you.
 So, so.
 Mee thinketh that you doo not
so well as you were wont.
 How know you that?
 By your face which is so pale.
 I haue had fiue or six fits of an ague,
which haue much weakened mee: and
haue taken away all my stomack.It is an euell sickenesse:
whither ride you so softly?
 To London, to Barthelmew fayre.
 And I also: if you will,
wee will go together.
 It pleaseth mee very well: but you
 ride a litle to fast for mee.
 Let vs ride as you will,
it is all one to mee, for my horse
aumbleth very easely.
 And mine doth trot to hard:
now let vs go in gods name.
 Who bee they that doth go afore vs?
 I know them not truly: they be
Marchants: let vs pricke our horses
for to ouertake them, for I am afrayde
that wee bee out of our way.
 Wee bee not, bee not afrayde:
yet it is good to aske it.
 Aske of that shee sheapherd.
 My shee freend, where is the right
way hence to N. right before you,
turnyng neither on the right
neither on the left hand, till
you come to an highe elme tree,
then turne on the left hand.How many miles haue wee hence
to the next village?
 Twoo miles and a half, and a litle more.
 Now let vs go at leasure, for I am
out of doubt: I see the tree
wherof shee hath tolde vs: it is
very dustie: the dust doth
put out mine eies.
 Take this Taffeta to holde
before your face, and it will
keepe you from the dust and the sunne.
 It is not neede of, for the sunne
goeth downe: therefore I am afraied
that wee come not by day light
to the towne.
 Yes forsooth: but the worst is,
that this way is daungerous
because of theeues: they did rob
th'other day a riche Marchant
at that side of the tree, the which
maketh mee afrayde to be robbed,
except wee take heede:
I see the steepell of the towne
except I bee deceaued.
 Truely it wilbe late afore wee
come thither: I doubt that weemay not enter in.
 Yes forsooth: they doo not shut the
gates before neene.
 It is the better, for I would
not gladly lie in the subburbes.
 Nor I too.
 Let vs aske of these folkes for the best
Inne of this towne.
 Take no care for that:
I know well the best lodging of
the towne: it is the Swan, at the
great market place right ouer against
the crosse.
 Let vs make hast I pray you,
for they draw the drawyng bridge.
 I am so weary, that I cannot
go further: furthermore,
my horse halteth, I doo thinke that a nayle
doth pricke him, or hee is hurted vpon the
backe: besides, this pauement is so hard,
that it bruseth mee altogether.
 Let vs enter in then: god saue you
my freende.
 God geeue you good euenyng, Sir.
 Shallwee lodge within for this night?
 Yes forsooth, Sir: how many bee you?Wee bee ten of a company.
 Wee haue lodgyng enough for three
times as many: light downe when
it will please you.
 Haue you a good stable, good hey,
good oates, and good litter?
haue you good wine?
 The best in the towne: you shal tast of it.
 Haue you any thing to eate?
 Sir, light downe onelie,
you shall lacke nothyng.
 Vse vs well, for wee bee werie,
and halfe dead by hunger and thirst.
 Sirs, you shalbe very wel vsed,
and your horses also.
 It is well sayd: rub well my horse
when you haue taken of his saddell:
vndoo his tayle: geeue vnto him good
litter: take his halter which is in the
purs of the saddell: if he hath none,
buie you one, and then I will,
geeue you your money again, and you shal
haue some to drinke.
 Sir, there shalbe no faute:
hath your horse dronke?
 No, but doo not water him yet,for he is yet to hot: you
would cause him to take the Glaunders:
walke him a litle, and when he
hath eaten somwhat, you shall
bryng him to the water side: see if
the girtes bee not broken:
brynge my bouget which hangeth
on the sadels bowe: pull my bootes,
and make them cleane: then put my
boote hosen within.
 It shalbe dun: dooth it please you now
to come to supper? Thou sayest well:
thou art a good fellow: go too, let vs go:
I am readie.
 I go to supper to the towne:
if any body asketh after mee, you
shall finde mee at the Treasurers house:
or els tell them that I will come
streight after supper: harke,
to morow morning before you water
my horse, bryng him to the smith,
and let him take heede for prinkyng him:
Sirs, doo not forget to drinke
to mee, and I will pledge you all.
 Truly you are to blame, to breake
such a good companie.There is no remedie, I will keepe you
companie to morow all the day longe.
 What folkes bee there within?
 They bee gesse. Of what countrey.
 They bee Londonners: wil it please you
to sup with them? It is all one to vs.
 Much good may it doo you Sirs.
 God a mercy mine hoste.
 I pray you make good chere, and
spare not the wine, for it is
hot: drawer, draw a pinte
of Claret wine, that they may
taste of it: my gesse, how doo you like
this wine? hath it not a good tast?
hath it not a fayre colour?
what doth hee lacke? is it not worth
drinking?
 It is fayre & good: where is my hostes?
 She will come anone: make good cheere
in the meane time of such thinges that
you haue: you shalbe better an other time.
 Wee bee very well mine hoste, wee
thanke you.
 Sir, I drinke to you.
 I loue it of your hande my hoste, I
pledge you with all my harte.Sir, will please you to geue me leaue
to drink to you?
 I thank you an hundred thousa~ds times.
 I thinck to haue seen you
some time, but I do not remember
well where: me thinketh
that it is at London.
 Yea truelie: I am of London.
 It will not displease you if I aske
your name: let it not be anie displeasure
vnto you if I aske your name: shall I
be so bold as to aske your name?
 Howe do men call you?
 What is your name?

 Of what kindred are you?
 Of the linage of the Marshes.
 You saie true: I know you verie well:
howe dothe your health?
 As you see. Howe do you?
 As your frend: readie to do you
pleasur: ready to obeie you.
 I thank you of your good will:
from whence com you now?
 From beyond the sea: from Fraunce:out of Flanders: from highe dutchland.
 What newes in France?
 Truelie nothing good. How so?
 The ciuil warre is there so enflamed,
that the father is against the sonne, and
the sonne against the father: and are so
madde, that they drawe their
swordes against their proper bowels,
 God preserue vs from ciuill warres,
for it is an euell fleale: is it
true that I haue hearde saye?
 What Syr? That they haue doone
such a great murther in Paris?
 That knowe I not: when came
the newes?
 Yesternight by a post.
 O immortall God, how men bee
vnconstant: well, one must haue
patience: wee shall haue peace
when it will please God.
 What newes doth men report in
this towne?
 What newes do you hear?
 What good dothe men saie?
 What newes saye you?
 What newes?All is well: all goeth well.
 I know no newes.
 Nothyng but good. Sirs, by your

 Sir, if you bee ill at ease,
go and take your rest: your chambre

 My shee freend, is my bed ready?
is it good? Yea Sir:

sheetes bee all cleane.
 Pull my hosen, and warme
my bed, for I am very ill at ease:

my head well: soft, you tie it
to harde: bryng my pillow,
and couer mee well: draw the curtines,
and pin them with a pin:
where is the chambre pot? where is the

where be the iakes?
 Follow mee lackey, and I will
shew you the way: go vp.
streight, you shall finde themat the righthand: if you see them

Sir, doo you lacke any thing els?
are you well?
 Yea my shee freend: put out the candel,
and come neare to mee.
 I will put it out when I am out
of the chambre: what is your pleasure?
are you not well enough yet?
 I haue my head to loe, lift vp
a litle the bolster, I cannot
lie so loe: my shee freende, kisse mee
once, and I will sleape the better.
 Sleape, sleape: you are not sicke,
seeyng that you speake of kissyng
rather to die, then to kisse
a man in his bed, neither in other place:
take your rest in gods name: God geeue
you good night, and good rest.
 I thanke you fayre mayden.
 Ho, shall wee rise? is it not

 Now let vs returne to our lodgyng

London: come in.
 Haue you any karsies of Flaunders
diyng? Yea sir:

of what coulour do you lacke?
browne, grey, orenge, taunie, red,
yalow, violet or blew? I haue
of all the coulours, and of all prices.
 How sell you a yarde of this blacke?
I pray you doo not ouer sell it.
 Will you but a woorde? it shall
cost you a crowne a yearde.
 It is to much: I wil geeue .iiij. shillings.
 It is to litle truly: I should leese in it:
it coste mee more: take the whole
peece for sixe poundes
foure shillynges ten pence halpenie:
it is but foure shillynges sixe pence 
halpenie the yearde.
 It is to deare: how many yeardes
bee therin? You shall see it measured:
there bee .xxvii. els and a halfe,
and a half quarter.
 I will geeue sixe poundes at the last
worde: I haue forsaken as good
as this, and better
cheepe by a groate in an ell.
 You should take it: but I promise
you that except you were mycustomer, you should not
haue it vnder six poundes
fifteene shillynges: but seeyng that
it is you, I doo bate you aboue
neene shillinges on the peece.
I thinke that you desier not
my losse: and truly if you refuse it,
no man in the world shall haue it
for the price: yea if it were my brother.
 Well, you shall bate mee that ten
pence for to make a rounde rekenyng.
 I will not sticke at ten pence.
 I will pay you in good gold, & of weight.
It is all one to mee: white money is as
good vnto mee as golde: but truly
you are to harde: neuerthelesse
I had rather leese, then to sende
you away: I hope that an other time
I shall haue of your money
sooner then an other.
 Yea in deede: I will not forsake you
for an other: I would I had
a porter, a packbearer, for I
must buie manie other
thinges, and my lodging is fare of.
 What lack you more?A peece or two of veluet:
 I haue none truely: but go
to the next shop at the other
side of the streete, and he will let
you haue it better cheape for my sake.
 Sir, what lacke you? 
 doo you seeke for any good veluet, Saten
damaske, fustian, worsted, buckram,
sarsenet, or any sort of silke
clothe? what will you haue?
you shall haue good cheape.
 That prentise hath a good tongue:
he waiteth for his maisters profit:
 Shew mee a peece of blacke veluet.
 Well, I will: beholde, is it not
good? did you euer see the like?
 Haue you not better?
 Yes forsooth, but it is of a greater price.
 I care not whatsoeuer it costeth,
if it bee good.
 Here is the best veluet which you
euer did handell.
 You will make mee beeleeue so:
I haue seen better, and worse
too: doo not vnfolde it all:
I haue had the sight of it.There is no hurt: he which
hath vnfold it, shall fold it agayne well enough:
for a knaues paine is not to bee set by.
What shall I pay for the yard?
 Twentie shellinges. You hold it to hie.
 No truely, for it is not possible to
find better, neyther of a fayrer colour.
 Saye what you will, but I will not
geue so much.
 What will you geue for? that I may
sell, and may haue your handsell:
I trust that you will bring mee good loock.
 I will geue seuenten shillings at
one word: shall I haue it? no truelie:
I can not fourde it at that price,
you know it well, one need not
to tell it vnto you: it costeth mee more
then you doo offer me: I should leese
to much.
 How sell you the twoo peeces
together? and let vs haue but a woord.
 Will you but one woord? you shall
pay two and thirtie pounds,
as much at one woord as in an hundred:
you should not auayle a halpeny.
 No, no: you are to deare: tell methe last woorde, and doo not cause mee
to tarie so longe.
 Sir, I haue tolde it you: I am
a man of one worde: I can not
vtter it for lesse, except I would leese.
 Seeyng that you are a man of one word,
wee must go to other places,
for you set your ware out of reason.
 Go whether it will please you in gods
name: seeke for your best:
I had rather that an other doo get in it,
then I should leese: yet I may
assure you of one thinge, that if
you should go to all the shoppes and store
howses in London, you shall
not get such a pennieworth as
I offer vnto you: notwithstandyng if
you finde no better come agayne:
you know my price.
 Your price is not for vs.
 Well, at your commaundement:
you know what you haue to doo.
 Well, seeyng that wee cannot
agree of the price farwell:
haue mee commended.
 At your good pleasure: if I couldlet it for a lesser price, you should haue it
as soone as any man in the world:
chieflie for his sake
which hath sent you to mee.
 They go awaye: they be gone.
 Let them go: let them runne
they be calues: when they haue
runned their bellie full about the faire,
they wilbe glad to come againe:
 Sir, it seemeth vnto me that the veluet
is verie good: if wee do refuse it,
we shall not find easelie
such for the price: let vs aske him
if he will bate the fourtie shyllinges.
 Shall wee tak it? Yea, if you
do beleeue me, and you will not
repent of it.
 Maister, they come againe.
 They shalbe welcome if they
bring monie.
 I pray you do not cause vs to
take more labour: will you take
thirtie poundes for both the peeces
without any turning againe? and tell
monie.
 Truelie you are tedious:you care not whether I leese 
or winne: it is all one vnto you:
go to, go to: let vs measure it.
 No, no: I take it as if it weremesured:
I trust you well.
 This olde angel is to short:
this frenchcrowne is to light:
these peeces of ten shillynges be clipped:
this ducate is not of weight:
this crowne of Flaunders is not
corant: this ryall is base golde:
this dauller is not of good siluer:
these spanish reals
are not of good mettell.
 You are very difficult in receauyng
of money: if I had knowen so much, if
you had solde mee your marchaundise
for twentie poundes,
verely I would not
haue it.
 Sir, it is at your choice,
to take it or leaue it:
I doo not get so much in it, that I
should take anie light money,
or which is not corant.
 Truely I haue not coyned it,neither clipped. I beleeue it well:
I know no help in it.
 Holde, there is my purse, pay
yourself at leasure.
 There is a counterfet shillyng.
 Nayle it at the threshal of the doore.
 It shalbee doone: brynge mee an
hammer and a nayle: I would
that the eares of him which hath
coyned it, were as well nayled
as it is.
 It would bee no hurt at all:
now, are you contented?
 Yea Sir, I thanke you:
spare nothyng that I haue aswell
without money, as with money.
 God a mercy Sir: Porter,
lay this vpon your backe, and
carie it to my lodgyng.
 I know not where you doo lodge.
 At the signe of the golden Lion,
in Fishstreete:
and tell them that they will prepare the 
dinner, for wee will depart by and by.
 Shall wee buie a baby or two 
for our children.Buie some for vs both.
 Well hostesse, shall wee dine.
 Washe when yee will, and go
and sit.
 Cause our horses to bee sadled & brideled
wee shouldbee two 
miles hence: goto, let vs dine standing:
let vs go, let vs haue a rekening myne hoste:
what do wee owe?
 You owe foure shyllinges six pense
man and horse.
 Hold are you contented. Yea Sir.
 Where is y=e= maide~? hold my shee freend,
ther is for your paines: bring hyther
my horse: haue you dressed him well?
yea Sir, he did wante nothing.
 Hold, ther is someto drink, as I haue
promised thee, to the end that thou maiest
remember me an other time.
 I thank you Sir, you shall find me
at all times readie to do you seruice.
spare not the lodging when you shall
passe here by, for you shalbe as well
vsed and serued, as in anie lodging
within London.
 I haue found it so: I will not
chaunge it for an other.
