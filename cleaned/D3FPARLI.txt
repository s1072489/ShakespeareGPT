To you, as well of the Manufacture, as the Matronship, I speake to all in generall, I haue knowe a Lord contented with one Lackey, a Master with one man, a Tenant with one Land-lord, a Bird with one mate, a Cow with one Milk-mad, and shall a man desire to have two wives, that (alas) with al he can do, can hardly please one? nay, grant them two, in time they will grow to ten, from ten to twentie, and then what a racket there would be who should rule the roast? Nay, I have heard of one that had at once a 1000. wives & concubines: Now out upon him for a
Methinks they should rather have consulted, that woe~n might have had 2 strings to their Bow, that if one slipt the other might hold, one for weeke dayes to drudge within doors, another for Holy-dayes to walke abroad with her, and usher her in his best cloaths; keeping one for delight, the other for her drudgery;
our sexe is now of late grown Cowards, carpet and curtaine hearted: Where be those magnanimous and Masculine spirited Matrons? Those valiant Viragoes? those lusty Ladies? those daringDamsels,and the rest? who made Coxecombes of, Puppets of Princes, Captives of Captains, Fooles of Philosophers, and Hench men of their husbands? but though we want weapons, and are abridged of their armes, yet they shall know, thatwe have the Law in our owne hands, and in our own cases we will be our owne Lawyers, and plead our own rights. For wee have tongues to tell our own Tales, and our Tales shall be heard and handled, when some of theirs shall not: What, give these Cocks leave to crow, and we shall have the Ravens follow after.
I thinke the Proverb may be very well verified in my husband; which is, that many Taylors goe to the making up of one man; for he hath no more mettle in him then a Mouse; he works altogether with hot needle, and burnt thread: for nothing he doth prospers with me. I thinke the reason is, because he uses an unlawful Yard, and wants that handfull which belongs to the Citie measure, or else because he sits crosse leg'd on his shop-board, like a dead Hare on a Poulterers stall, and no good work can be done that way. If at any time he make me a new peticoate, he will threaten to sit upon my skirts, and that's all: He will sow and sow, and yet when he hath done all hee can, it proves but so and so,
I take it, your best course Mistris, is to acquaint yourselfe with some Courtier his Customer, and when any Masque or show is to be presented at Court, he may helpe you to a good standing.
my name is, a Felt-makers wife, and know no more from my husband of the three parts that belong to a Noune Substantive but the first, and that is felt, and nothing else worthy to be heard or understood.
Nay, you may take me too in your number, for my case is as much to be condoled as any's, who have a very pea-goose and patch-pannell to my good man: well, his girthes or Latchets may passe for currant, but I could never see a good stirre-up from him since he was my husband: I confesse he is saddle-nos'd and saddlebackt too, but never could set the saddle on the right horse since I knew him:
my good man is his customer, who keepes the saddle to himselfe, but gives me the bit and the bridle: he can teach his horses to pace as he list; but for himself he hath neither good amble, trot, nor gallop.
for
was not every woman born with two legges, two hands, two eyes, two eares: and every deepe Well ought to have two Buckets, while one is comming up, the other going down? have not most great houses two doores? likewise have not most Tavernes a fore-door & a backe-door, with two signes and two bushes, every ship a fore-Mast and a maine-Mast: most Cities two or three gates, and every gate three or foure Watch-men; and every Beadle three or foure men every night in his Lanthorne, or else their money? hath not every stoole or chaire three or foure legges, and every bed-stead two posts, (and three or four Curtains) the better to support the other parts of them, and therefore in conscience every Woman may have two husbands: for have not we women six Sences, and men but five? the major part wee know includes the minor: therefore the case is cleare on our sides, for wee have nothing to offend and defend our selves but our tongues, which wee bring in for another sence; for the tongue tells whatthe eare heares, what the eye sees, what the hand handles, what the palat tasteth, what the nose smelleth, therfore the tongue ought to be the sixth Sence, which we must maintain for our own safety: though woman was taken out of the side of man, yet let men know, that they cannot, nor shall not alwayes keepe us under. I put the case to you, suppose a handsome Lasse marries a Sea-faring man, perchance his occasions call him to goe a long voyage to SEA, as to the East or West Indies, or to the straights of, the Reed or Red SEA, or to theGulfe: he is bound to stay a yeare, two or three, before he can returne: doe you (nay prethee good sister, let mee not bee interrupted in my speech: pray silence, or I will say no more; for I now speak to the purpose) as I have said, doe you think it convenient such a prettie soule should lye alone, having been wedded so short a time, and only tasted of you know what, and having been a fellow feeler, and helper in most cases, for the Common-wealths good, that she can be content to lye alone tumbling and tossing in a good featherbed, sometimes to the Wall, sometimes to the doore, sometimes of one side, and somtimes of the other: sighing and groaning, as if her very twatling strings would breake; making her moane to the Curtaines, fumbling and biting, or tearing the sheets, and by that meanes ease her oppressed body and minde: nay, I should not say oppressed bodie for there I was mistaken, there my tongue wenttoo fast, I should have said her troubled and perplexed spirit, heart, or what you terme it, Ought not, I say, such women to have two or three husbands? yes, yes,
being alwayes provided, and for the good of the Common-wealth: So likewise the Souldier and Captain when they are gone to the Wars, the Merchant, the Factor, & the Mariner when they are gone to Sea, a foolish Plaintiffe and his Defendant, that will come up post two or three hundred miles to spend his money, and stay a whole Terme before he return to his beloved: ought not these (and many more which I could name, which for brevites sake I omit) to leave one husband at home, while the other being at Sea, lookes to the maine boling, and that the fore-Mast and maine-yard, and all other tackling be fit and compleat for his occations: The Facter while he looks to cast up his accompts abroad, shee may looke and cast up hers at whome: the Plaintiffe and Defendant while they be spending mony at Law shee may get some at home by love. All these cases are to be considered; for every musket must have -- scouring sticke, and every Gun must have a rammer, and every pen must be dipped in inke before it will write: Has not every Constable his Beadle, every Serjeant his Yeaman? hath not every Officer in a ship his mate: as the Surgeon he hath his mate, the Master his mate; and the Gunner his mate: It is good to have two strings to ones Bow, if one break the other may hold: that if one be dogged and surly, the other may be pleasant and joviall; that whileone be off the hooks, the other may be on the hinges; Upon which motion it is fully agreed upon by us women, who are here present, which find it better for us woman to have two husbands, that if one be sick, the other may be well, one abroad and another at home:
but let mee tell you one thing, which might put a rub in our way: What if our husbands object and say, that we promised to love & obey them at the day of our marriage, & that we must be tyed to that promise? By our Lady that is true
what must be our plea for that? Ile tell you
Let us answer thus much in that behalfe; that we had a mentallreservation, when the wisest of us said so; for though our husbands expect it at our hands all our life time, we must say that we ment it only for that day, and the first night, and no longer; and therefore by this meanes we may wave the businesse, and repeale that Law:
let it be likewise enacted, that since maids for the most part mary in hast, and repent at leisure, that we may be hasty also in our own houses, that if ourhusbands be peevish, we may pout; when they are harsh, we may be humorous: they curst we crabbed; and when they think to make us melancholy, we in requitall strive to make them horne mad, by making our Petticoates our Purlewes: at which if they grudge or grumble, wee may finde answers, by looking upon our apron-strings; knowing by experience, that most men are of a strange kidney, and will never bee at quiet full nor fasting;
the want of which reformation,
I have endured to my great prejudice:
my husband
in anger said, he would thump me, to whom I answered; thump me? where wilt thou thump mee? thump me but where thou shouldst thu~p me, or Ile make it the dearest thumping that ever thou didst thumpe in thy life: and I thinke I hit him home, which was more than ever he did to me, and thenI had him on the hip: and you should have kept him so when you had him there
if you had been wise: But concerning your great thumpers, concerning him who said that a Law might be made, that no woman should suffer her self to be thumpt but as she ought to be;
Thus
I hold it requisite also, that every woman of sence, should take delight to please her eye with the most curious objects, either of such pictures as wee like, or such men as wee love: Her eare rather with curious and choyse Musicke, or have some Courtship that may content her, or somewhat publisht in her praise: Her smell rather with sweet and redolent flowers at home, or precious odours and perfumes fetcht from abroad: her touch either with the Pluch and Taffates of her owne gay garments, or by the griping of his smooth & soft hand whom she most dearly affected: Her taste with all dainty and deare fare, with either fowle or Fish, with sweete Wines and sweete meats, banqueting and junkets, and every variety that can taste the appetite, or please the palate. And for our more ease let us lie a bed till ten of the clocke, and the~ have a Candlebrought to our bed side for our break-fast; and be ready by dinnertime, and then walke abroad to take the ayre till supper-time; and so spend the weeke about; and if they aske the reason thereof, tell them it must bee so, because it must be so; and let them understand, that Mo~dayis Sundayes brother, and that Tuesday is such another, Wednesday they must goe to Church & pray, and Thursday is halfe holy day, Friday it is too late to begin to spin, and Saturday all the world knows is half holy-day agen. You speak wel in that
for why should we toyl and turmoyl for our horn-headed and hard-headed husbands, and not taste of the sweet as well as of the sowre, of the gaine as the paine, the pleasure as the puzzle. If the husbands be ours, then be their goods ours, their lands ours, their Cash and Coine ours, and all their moveables, (howsoever seldome in motion ours too) and at our command; then why should we be niggards, and not spend freely of our owne? or why, when they be prodicall abroad, should we be penurious at home? nay, let us eate good fare, keepe good fires, want nothing that Women should have, good cates after good company: we can then bid any God-speed without good gossips. It is fit wee should bee merie so it fall within compasse of meanes: and for my owne part, I make use of the old proverb.
Further let it be enacted,
that whosoever shall hereafter take a Wife, shall doe it with the intent to please her, serve her, and obey her, and the first day of their Bridals, as a signe and token of duty to her, and all the rest, place here at the upper end of the Table; or if she like not that place, put her in the middle, and with his hat in his hand wait on her till she hath halfe, or at the most three quarters dined; and then (if he have leave) to sit down, which must be done by her licence, that he place himself at the lower end of the Table, and make a short meale tell they be ready to take away, and that at supper he doe the like, and after that she goe to bed first, and rise last, and not attempt any thing but that stands with her good liberty and liking,
I intreat that I may have a finger in the pye too as well as the rest: a fooles bolt (like my hasbads) is soon shot, and so is mine: when I was as well in health as any here, I complained to my good man of my heart and head, my Liver and my Lungs, & (indeed) I know not of what: who comming home said, wife how doe you doe? I answered sick, good man, very sicke: then the fond Coxcomb bid me speake for any thing I had a minde unto; for saith he, no question but thou dost breed; I, I, said I, I do breed, but you never get me any thing: no, saith he, who gets it then? I told him againe that it was no matter to him who gets it; for sure said I, I maylong and long, but shall be sure to come short of what I long for; why what dost thou long for, said my husband? For that (quoth I) which is beyond your reach, I wisse: Silke Gowne, and Sattin Petticoate of the fashion, an Italian cut-worke Handkercheif, and a black bag, with al the appurtenances thereto belonging. I but said he, sweete Wife, these are above my calling: why then said I, mine own calling shall serve; for the next gallant Player I will call in, who, what he cannot adde to the happinesse of your memory, shall strive to augme~t in your honourable state of Matrimony:
therfore
adde this to the other, let women from hence forward, if they be shreerish or shie, try it out with them at sharp, or if beetle-head and blockish, with blunter weapons.
yet
my husband is a Gamester, and as he games abroad, so I play at home: if hee bee atbowles and kisse the Mistris, I can for recreation play at rubbers with his man: when he hath beene all the day at passage, & hazard, at night he comes home, and playes with me at Doublets, Barramesace, and Back-gammon, but I am sometimes even with him, for when he with his sweet-hearts ventures his state at the hole, I with his servant can passe away the time at In and In:
as I hold Mistris, that lawfull which you doe, so I hope, that I bringing my sack to the mill, it may be ground among the rest: that is, when our hausbands trouble us, we may likewise torment them: if they fret, wee frowne: they grudge, we grumble, they prate, we glout, they crosse, wee curst; if they bend their browes, we may bend our fists; and be they never so outragious, we to carry no coals in any case. But let it then be added
that no reconcilement without some reward, and no pardon may be granted without a new gowne and Peticoate; which if demurr'd upon, at the first or second demand, it shall bee in her choyce to aske him the third: and if he cog and offer to kisse you, and tell you that he will kisse you, bid him take you about the middle and kisse the heaviest end: or if he faile, she may reade him a, as far as the scope of her invention,. Or if hee notwithstanding all this, be pevish and perverse, she may also continue proud and peremptory, till she raile him into reconcilement, and make himprovide a feast to entertaine her Gossips, and make his peace that way.
if she have a mind to take the aire, or walke to Green-goose Fair, or to any merrie meeting, or Market: if she desire his company, that hee new blacke his shooes, and put on his best hat and cloake to wait on her thither, ushering her before, or take her gently by the arme, and lovingly to leade her: or if (for some reasos best known to her selfe) she would have his abscence, that he patiently put money in her purse, and stay at home without grumbling.
let not maides stay from marriage till they are troubled with the greene-sicknesse:
But one thing we have forgot,
which is a main matter, that is, to seeke out cure for any old or young:
my good man came home drunk the other day, and because I should not see him in that manner, he hid himselfe in the house of speciall Office, and their he began to ease his stomacke, and lay about him like a Hog, when he hath eaten so much that he is ready to burst: & because I should not heare him: hee thrusts his head into the hole; and whether it was his large Asses eares, or his Bul necke, I cannot tell, but he could not get his necke out again, but needs must pull up the seate about his necke, so that he looked as if he had been on the Pillorie.
For
put his head out of the window well enough, but could not get it back again, which was long of his Hornes: this
is your husbands case. I pray you Mistris,
tell me, and the rest of oursisters the cure and remedie for it. Thus you must doe
my deare and loving sisters, because
the effect lyes at the heart, & the cause in the head,
you must first remove the cause, and the effect will
follow.Mistris Doe-litle)Pump-water,Cloves, Mace, Nut-megs:Suger-candy,Hearts-easedainty Content,Candid Forgetfulnesse,Beter Conceit,Rubarb,Colaquintida,Stibium,Long white Pepper,.
 Now the inward remedie being applyed, he mustthen observe the outward meanes: he must conceit
himselfe a Batchelour or widower againe, as he
was at the first state when he came a wooing to her:
the~ must he make himself a mourning suit & cloak,
& walk as demurely and as sad, as if his Wife were
dead indeed: he must likewise be so well conceited
of himselfe, as if no such thing had ever beene or
thought of: then he must refraine her company: &
the house where she is, eight or ten dayes together,
then begin to enquire of her, as if she were a
stranger to him, afterwards visit her, and then send her
presents, and make much of her, then make good
cheere, and when you are in a merry veine, aske
her if she can love you? then will she say presently,
yes, if you can affect her: then get a licence, and
forthwith marry her: that beeing done, see then if
any dear so much as point at you with their 
fingers, or call you Cuckold as formerly they did, if
they doe, then have you the Civill Law on your
side to punish them there, & an action at the
Common Law for defamation, and their punish their
purses and bodie too; and this is the only cure for
old and new Cuckolds: and withall take notice,
that this must bee done when the Moone is
encreasing, and in the second quarter, for it will help
their businesse forward, and cause them better to
conclude their intended purposes:
