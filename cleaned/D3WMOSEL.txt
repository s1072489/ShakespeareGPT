Masterif you had desired councell, the Court would have assigned you councell.
comming home to my Chamber, about six of the clock in1647. I found Sircame rushing out of my Chamber, and Ientring saw my Wife throwne upon the ground; with all her cloathes torne, the Bed-cloathes torne and hanging halfe way upon the ground, my Wife crying and wringing her hands, with her clothes all torne off her head, her wrist sprained, Sirhaving throwne her violently upon the ground, whereupon (seeing her in this condition) I asked her what was the matter, shee said Sirhad Ravisht her,
Sirtwo or three dayes before he did the Rape, sayd that he would ravish my Wife though hee were sure to be hang'd for it,
upon my Oath here I sweare, That hee sayd hee would force mee to my Bed, and then hee swore God damme him, Hee would lie with mee though hee were sure to die for it, Then hee takes mee and carries mee to a narrow place, betwixt the wall of the Bed, and with his hands forst my hands behinde mee, and lay with mee whether I would or no,
did not your Husband come to the Chamber doore at that time you pretended you were Ravisht, and knockt at the Doore, and I would have opened the Doore for him, whereupon you sayd it is my Husband; Let the drunken sotstay without, and would not suffer mee to open the Doore,
I sayd that if shee were ravisht as shee sayd shee was, shee must take her Oath of it, and indite him for it,
but
being desirous to be further satisfyed in the businesse I often sought for Sir, but could not finde him, for he had fled away from his Chamber. One day I met him accidentally in Holborne, and desired to speake a word with him, he said he knew my businesse, but he was in hast and could not stay; Then I told him I had earnest businesse with him, and I must speake with him, he told me he suspected I had some designe to arrest him, and would not be perswaded to stay, then I prest him that if he would goe and drink a cup of Ale with me, he should come in no danger concerning any arrest at all; and if he then would give me satisfaction, I would not prosecute the Law against him:
onely to know what he could say to excuse himselfe,
why, would you believe him before your Wife?
my meaning was, if he could satisfie me that my Wife was consenting to it, I had rather wave the prosecution, then bring my Wife and my selfe upon the Stage, and this was my intent and no other.
a little before there was my Maide, but I had sent her to the Bakers house for bread for my Children, and in the meane while he lay with me against my will.
when I came from the Bakers, and entring into the chamber, I found my Mistris crying, and wringing her hands, saying she was undone; Also I heard Sirsay, before I went to the Bakers, that he would lie with my Mistris though he were sure to be hang'd for it, and at all timeshee was wont to bee very uncivill and rude when hee came into the Chamber, once hee came into the Chamber when I was there alone, truly I durst not stay in the Chamber, for I alwayes observed, Hee was so lecherously given that any Woman were shee never so meane would serve his turne; At this time hee came into the Chamber a little before I went to the Bakers, I observed hee would faine have throwne my Mistris upon the Bed when I was there, but my Mistris would not yeeld to it, but grew very angry with him, and said hee was a rogue, and spit in his face, yet hee would not let her alone, whereupon I told him, if hee would not be more civill, I would call my Master, and if hee came hee would crack his crowne for using my Mistris so uncivilly, Siranswered hee cared not a fart for my Master, and that for mee I was a base Jade, and hee would make mee kisse his, &c.
he said she should kisse something that was about him, what was that
he said he would make her kisse his Arse,
you must not be so nice in speaking of the truth, being upon your Oath,
then came Masterto tamper with me from Sir, and told me if I pleas'd to accept a hundred pounds, I should have it, if I would be reconciled to Sir;
my Mistris made this answer, shee cared not for Money:
it is true I said so; and this I said, If Sirwould downe upon his knees and confesse that he had wronged me, I would not prosecute him; But also I resolved that he should weare a Paper upon his Breast, or upon his Hatt, acknowledging the injury hee had done unto mee: if hee would doe so I would forgive him.
Masterdesired to know where the place was in the roome where I was ravisht; whereupon I shewed him. Masteranswered, this was such a place for such a businesse, that if I had the strongest woman in England, I could ravish her here whether she would or no.
Masterthough you bee not upon your Oath, you must speake the truth in the feare of God,
I know it my Lord; what I shall say here, I speake it in the presence of God, and I shall speake no more then what is truth:
I hope no body will believe what this Knavewill say, for he is a Knave knowne to all the Court, and all that heare him.
I thanke God this is the second time I ever came in this womans company; the first time was at the Fleece Taverne in Covent-Garden, where shee came to a Dinner to meete with Sir: As soone as shee had set downe at the Table, shee said, that this Roome had bin a very lucky Roome to her, for once before in this Roome, shee had received three hundred pounds for the composition of a Rape, which shee charged a Reverend Divine withall, I shall not stick to name the man, shee said it was Doctor; this Doctor I knew him to be a reverend man, and to my knowledge is long since dead, and in Heaven; and for this Rape, shee said then, shee would not take under two thousand pounds for a composition of Sir, which shee said was little enough, hee having three thousand poundsa yeere.
you should carry your selfe soberly and moderately, otherwise you will disparage all your witnesses.
after shee had sate a while at the Table, she takes her stoole and removes it to sit next to Sir, and there falls hugging and imbracing him; whereupon said hee, surely Lady whereas you say Sirhath ravisht you, I doe beleive rather you have ravisht him, otherwise you would not make so much of him,
after I had seriously look't upon her, and seeing of her a woman of that strength and body, I said, I wondred Sirshould ravish her: She said, do you wonder at that, why? doe you take me behinde the Bed there (there being a Bed in the Roome) and see whether you may not doe it.
afterwards shee asked him, now what will you give my Maide you must give her something? he answered, Ile give her fourty shillings, whereupon shee said, fourty shillings, that's base, you cannot give her lesse then ten pound and a Silke Petticoate; But saith shee, when he went forth of Doores, shee said he gave her nothing but a Groat, and so basely went his way.
tis true shee tooke mee, and shewed mee the place where shee was ravisht.
Why sayd shee should you wonder at that? Then shee put her Leg betweene my Legges, and put her other Legge setting her Foote against the Wall, saying now in this posture as you see mee here, I my selfe could ravish any Woman whatsoever.
the night before shee went to preferre the Bill of Inditement against Sir, shee confest shee had like to have beene distracted and runne mad, for feare the Grand Jury should finde the Bill.
take heede what company you
keepe hereafter, Let this be a warning to
you, you see in what danger you bring
your selfe to in keeping ill
Company.
