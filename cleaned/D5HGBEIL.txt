 I rejoice at the
Honour of seeing you

 The Honour is mine.
 I am as glad to see
you.
 I have not had the
Satisfaction a long
while.
 Pray Sir, sit down.
 I thank you Sir, my
Time is short.
 You shall not go

 You'll do me the
Favour to breakfast

 But I must be going.

of Business.
 The Days are short,
and Business will
be minded.
 I won't hinder you
now, but I don't
reckon this a Visit.
 You have laid a great
Obligation on me.
 I am your most 
humble Servant, Sir.
 I am yours with all
my Heart.

Friends at Home. Can you make me

it made of?
 You shall first make
me a Suit of the
finest Cloth, and
then a Summer
Suit.
 Have you bought the
Cloth already?
 Yes, there it is.
 How much is there,
Sir?
 Five Yards.
 It will hardly be
enough.

in Conscience.
 You must consider,

their Cloaths long
now.
 However I'll see.

 You may depend on
it. Well, have you
brought my Cloaths?Yes, Sir, here they
are.
 Try them on.
 Be pleas'd, Sir, to put
on the Coat.
 Let me see if it be
well made.
 I believe, Sir, you will
be very well
satisfy'd with it.
 Methinks it's very 
long.
 It is the Fashion.
 Button it.
 It is too streight for
me.
 It fits you exactly.
 The Sleeves are too
wide.
 Not at all, they are as
they should be.
 The Breeches are
very streight.
 They must be so, it
is the newest 
Fashion.
 The Suit becomes
you very well.
 Where are the
Remnants of my Cloth?There are none at all
left.
 Have you made your
Bill?
 No, Sir, I han't had
Time to do it.
 Bring it to Morrow
and I'll pay you
your Money. Have you any Shoes

 I'll see, if you please
to sit down a
little.
 What Shoes will you
have, Sir?
 Good strong Shoes
this dirty Weather.
 With wooden or
leathern Heels?
 Wooden.
 This Pair will fit
you.
 They are too little,
they pinch me.What do you think
of these?
 I don't like them at
all, they are
clownish.
 Then you must
bespeak a Pair.
 But I must have 'em
to Morrow.
 You shall, Sir. Here are your Shoes.
 They are not
fashionable, they are too
long.
 Make me another
Pair.
 I have brought
another Pair with me.
 These are better than
the other.
 These are good.
 What's the Price of
them?
 Six Shillings.They are too dear.
 There's a Crown for
you. Mistress, what must
I give you to wash
my Linnen?
 How will you have
it wash'd, Sir?
 By the Dozen, by the
Piece, or by the
Quarter?
 What do you take a
Dozen?
 According to the
Fineness, Sir.
 Eight Pence, or
twelve Pence the
Dozen.
 But you must pay for
your Shirts and
Neckcloths apart.
 How much?According as they
are, Sir.
 A Penny, or two
Pence a Neckcloth,
and a Groat a
Shirt.
 I'll give you six Pence
a Dozen, three
Pence a Shirt, and
a Penny a 
Neckcloth.
 I won't stand with
you, Sir.
 Bring it again on
Saturday. Sir, here's your
Linnen.
 What makes it look
so yellow?
 I hardly know it.
 You have quite
spoil'd it.Sir, you must pardon 
me this Time.
 It never is so white
this dirty Weather
as in Summer.
 It is not well iron'd.
 I'll do it better
another Time.
 Pray don't be angry,
Sir.
 How much does it
come to?
 Six Shillings.
 Come again on
Monday, then I'll pay
you, and give you
more foul
Linnen.

 No, Sir, whither
would you have
me drive?
 To Court.
 What must I give
you to carry me
thither?
 Two Shillings.
 Two Shillings from
hence to Court?
 It is my Fare.
 Make Haste then.
 Hold Coachman, I
must stay here a
little.
 Pray, Sir, don't stay
long.
 I'll come again
immediately.
 I must stay here some
Time, I'll pay you
by the Hour.
 What must I give
you an Hour?
 Eighteen Pence.
 That's too much.
 We won't disagree,
Sir.Hold Coachman, I
must go out here.
 Shall I stay for you,
Sir?
 No, there's your
Money. What will you buy,
Sir?
 What do you look
for, Sir?
 A Piece of good
Spanish Cloth for a
Suit of Cloaths.
 Be pleas'd to come in
Sir, I have the best
in Town.
 Shew me a Piece of
the best black or
colour'd.
 There's a fine Piece,
Sir, if you like theColour.The Cloth is good,
but I don't like the
Colour;
 It is too dark.
 There's a lighter
Colour.
 I like the Colour, but
the Cloth is too
coarse.
 There's no finer to be
had for Money.
 What's this a Yard?
 The very lowest is
eighteen Shillings.
 How! eighteen
Shillings? sure you take
me for a Stranger.
 No, Sir, we make
no Difference.
 I'm not us'd to make
Words, I'll give
you 3 Crowns.
 Indeed it cost more.
 It is too dear, come
I'll give you t'other
Shilling.I can't give it one
Penny under 17
Shillings.
 Well, cut off 5 Yards,
and give me good
Measure.
 You shall have due
Measure, but I do
not get a Shilling
by you.
 Have you good Hats,
and Silk Stockings?
 Yes, Sir, the best
in Town, of all
Sorts.
 Let me see them.
 I do not like your
Hats, they are too
thin.
 I have thicker and
stronger if you
desire them.
 I'll consider of it,
and come again
to Morrow.
 You will not find
better, Sir, in the
whole Town.What do you ask for
these Silk
Stockings? They are
very light.
 I have heavier, but
they are knit.
 No, I like these
better, what shall I
give you a Pair?
 The lowest is sixteen
Shillings.
 I'll give you twelve:
 And will take 3 Pair.
 Truly, Sir, I cannot
give them for that
Price.
 Well, I'll give you
40 Shillings for 3
Pair.
 Come, Sir, I won't
stand with you.
 Will you have your
Goods carried
home, Sir?
 Yes, and send me
half a Dozen ofwhite Gloves, and
your Bill with
them.
 I am obliged to you,
Sir.
 I hope you'll be my
Customer another
Time.
 With all my Heart. Master, whither are
you bound?
 For Hambro'.
 When do you design
to sail?
 As soon as the Wind
serves.
 With the first fair
Wind.
 Where does your
Ship lye.
 Here just by, you
may see it if you
please.
 Have you got any
Passengers?Yes, Sir, I have a
great many.
 What shall I give you
for my Passage?
 Three Guineas is the
common Price.
 Must I find my own
Provision?
 Yes, Sir, and pay for
your Servants
besides, if you have 
any.
 You are too dear with
me.
 I'll give you two
Guineas, and one for
my Servant.
 I won't disagree with
you, Sir.
 You must let me have
a good Cabbin.
 You shall have good
Convenience.
 Sir, the Wind is
good.
 I'll send my Goods on
Board 
immediately, and go downmy self towards
Evening.
 Methinks the Wind
is come about.
 It is a great Storm.
 The Wind is yet very
fair, as good as we
can wish.
 It is 
South-South-West.
 South West and by
West.
 If the Wind continues
so, we shall soon
get a Sight of
Helgoland.
 What Land is that?
 An Island at the
Mouth of the Elve.
 There you may see
the Island, Sir.
 How far have we
now to the River?
 Four German Miles.
 And how far from
thence to
Hambro'?
 Eighteen Miles.How soon may we
hope to be in 
Hambro'?
 To Morrow Night
if the Wind don't
fail us. Landlord, can we
have a Lodging
with you to Night?
 Yes, Sir, we have
Rooms enough, and
very good Beds.
 Will ye be pleas'd,
Gentlemen, to 
alight?
 Shew us a Room.
 Will ye take the
Trouble to walk
up, Gentlemen?
 What have you got
to eat?We have a Piece of
Beef on the Spit.
 Bring it up as soon as
it is enough.
 Will you have
nothing else,
Gentlemen?
 Yes, a Fricassy of
Chickens, and a
Couple of boil'd
Rabbits.
 But make Haste.
 Immediately Sir.
 Give us in the mean
Time a Bottle of
good old Hock for
a Whet?
 What will you be
pleas'd to drink at
Table?
 A good Glass of Beer,
and a Flask of
Burgundy.
 You shall have every
Thing to your
Satisfaction.
 Gentlemen, be pleas'd
to sit down, the
Meat is upon the
Table.Give us first some
Water to wash our
Hands.
 Pray, Sir, sit down.
 Shall I help you to
some of the
Fricassy.
 It is very good, but
a little too much
seasoned.
 The Beef is roasted
too much.
 It has neither Gravy
nor Moisture left
in it.
 Your Health, Sir.
 Sir, I thank you.
 Is the Wine good?
 So, so.
 It is none of the best.
 It is very good.
 You don't eat, Sir.
 I have no great
Appetite.
 I am tired with the
Journey.
 I am fitter for the
Bed, than the
Table.Are our Beds made?
 Yes, Sir.
 Let them be well
air'd.
 Where is your
necessary House?
 There in that Corner.
 Let us have
Looking-glasses.

 An Hour ago.
 At Break of Day.
 Get up Cousin, it is
Time to be going.
 Have you slept well?
 Not very well, I am
not us'd to 
travelling.
 Shall we breakfast
first, or shall we go
out fasting?
 If you please, Sir,
we'll first drink a
Dish of Coffee, and
eat a Mouthful of
Bread and Butter.
 And in the mean
Time pay our
Landlord.
 What have we to
pay, Landlord?Your Reckoning is
none of the largest.
 Altogether 30
Shillings.
 Is not that too much?
 No, Gentlemen, I 
have reckon'd
every Thing as low 
as possible.
 There's a Guinea and
a half for you, and
then we have a
Bottle of old Hock
to come in.
 I won't stand with
you for that.
 You are welcome,
Gentlemen.
 Favour me with
your Company
again quickly.
 Farewel Landlord.
 A good Journey to
you Gentlemen. Mistress, have you
Lodgings to Let.
 Yes, Sir, at your
Service.
 Will you have them
below, or up one
Pair of Stairs?
 Towards the Street,
or backwards?
 Furnish'd or
unfurnish'd?
 A Parlour and
Bed-Chamber up one
Pair of Stairs, next
the Street, and
ready furnish'd.
 Be pleas'd to walk
up, Sir.
 Here is a very
handsome Parlour, with
a Bed-Chamber
adjoining.
 What do you ask for 
these Rooms?Will you hire them
by the Year, the
Month, or the
Week?
 By the Week.
 The lowest is five
Shillings a Week.
 I'll give you four.
 I never had less than
I ask you.
 I'll give no more.
 It is too little, unless
you find your own
Fire and Candles.
 We shan't differ.
 Are your Beds good?
 Be pleas'd to see 
them, Sir.
 Make every Thing
ready; I'll fetch my
Goods, and come
again presently.What do you call
this Street?
 St. James's-Street.
 What Sign have you?
 The King's Arms. Your most obedient
Servant, Sir.
 I am yours, Sir, with
all my Heart.
 How am I so
fortunate to meet with
you here, Sir?
 I think my self very
happy to meet
with so good a
Friend in a Foreign
Country.
 How long have you
been in Hambro'?
 Since last Night.
 Where do you lodge,
Sir?In the Emperor's
Court.
 You are well lodg'd.
 Do you come from
England now, Sir?
 No, Sir, I come out
of Germany.
 How long have you
been from England?
 Upwards of 2 Years.
 Then you are Master
of the German
Language, I suppose.
 I staid some Time at
Leipsick to learn
it.
 I presume you speak
German too, Sir?
 I am but a Beginner,
and should be glad
of your Assistance.
 My help will be but
of little Service to
you.
 Pardon me, I should
be glad of anHour's 
Conversation with you on
that Head.
 When you please, Sir.
 Over a Bottle.
 Where can we have
a Glass of good
Wine?
 We have an excellent
Flask of Burgundy
in my Quarters.
 I'll wait on you this
Evening, with your
Permission.
 You will infinitely
oblige me, Sir. According to my
Promise, Sir, I take
the Freedom of
paying my
Respects to you.I take it as a great
Favour.
 Pray, Sir, sit down.
 You'll give me Leave,
Sir, to put you in
Mind of your last
Promise.
 What was it, pray?
 To lend me your
Assistance towards
learning the
German Language.
 I am a Scholar my
self yet.
 You are arriv'd to a
great Perfection.
 Had you a Master of
Languages?
 Yes, Sir, and I make
Use of him yet.
 What do you give him
a Month?
 Three Dollars.
 How often does he
come to you?Three Times a Week.
 How do you like the
German Language?
 Very well, it is an
ancient, noble, and
copious Language.
 Is it difficult to learn?
 Very difficult.
 Wherein consists the
Difficulty, in the
Pronunciation?
 No, the
Pronunciation is very easie:
 For the Germans
write no more
Letters than they
pronounce.
 The Germanandare the most
difficult for an
Englishman.
 Because they are
pronounc'd so deep in
the Throat.
 What other
Difficulties do you find in
the German
Language?The great Variety of
Terminations in
the Declension of
the Articles and
Substantives.
 The threefold
Terminations of the
Adjectives.
 And the Government
of the Cases by the
Prepositions.
 Are the Verbs
difficult?
 No, for the Germans
have but one
Conjugation, and but
two simple Tenses,
as we have.
 The irregular Verbs
are indeed
something hard,
numerous and very
variable.
 Is the Position easie?
 No, that is another
great Difficulty.
 Especially to one who
is us'd to a natural
Construction.What Grammar do
you make use of?
 That is what is
wanting.
 How! have the
Germans no
Grammar?
 Yes, they have indeed
some.
 But as the
German is
explained, and the Rules
given in German,
they are of little
Use to an English
Beginner.
 Pray send me your
Master of
Languages.
 He shall wait on you
to Morrow.
 I thank you, Sir.
 When shall I have the
Honour of your
Visit?
 I'll pay my Respects
to you to
Morrow Evening.I shall expect the
Honour. Did you send for
me, Sir?
 Yes, Sir, I should be
glad of some
Instruction in the
English Tongue.
 Have you a spare
Hour?
 Yes, Sir, this Hour
from 11, to 12.
 What must I give
you a Month?
 Two Ducats.
 How often do you
come a Week?
 I reckon 16 Hours
a Month.I'll give you your
Price, but pray be
diligent.
 I hope I shall give
you Satisfaction.
 When shall we
begin?
 Now if you please.
 What shall we begin
with?
 Can you speak any
English?
 I made a Beginning
some Years ago.
 Pray let me hear you
read.
 How do you like my
Pronunciation?
 Indifferent, did you
learn by Rule?
 By Rote.
 The common Fault
of most Masters of
Languages.
 Do you know any
Thing of the
English Grammar?
 Very little, I can only
repeat the auxiliaryVerbs, and form
a regular Verb
Active.
 And then I know the
irregular Verbs by
Heart.
 That is a good
Beginning.
 Do you know any
Thing of the Use
and Construction
of the Cases and
Tenses?
 Nothing at all.
 Nor the particular
Use of sundry
Verbs?
 No, Sir, I know
nothing but what I
have learn'd by
Rote.
 Now I know how far
you are advanc'd I
can the better tell
what Method to
take.
 Pray, what Method
shall we make Use
of?
 We will spend the
first half of our
Hour in Reading,and explaining at
the same Time.
 What Book shal I
read?
 As you already in part
understand what
you read, you shall
begin with
modern Comedies.
 There you will find
the most concise,
beautiful, and
expressive Phrases
of the English
Tongue.
 How shall we employ
the Remainder of 
our Time?
 In making the
necessary Observations
upon the
Etymology and
Construction of the different
Parts of Speech.
 And sometimes in
correcting or
examining what you
do in my Absence.
 What shall I do in
your Absence?First learn the
Vocabulary.
 Then the short
familiar Phrases.
 Afterwards the
Proverbs and familiar
Dialogues.
 At Times, the Rules
of Syntax and their
Examples.
 And then proceed to
Translation.
 What shall I
translate?
 Some short Italian
or French Letters.
 Why not German?
 Because the other,
especially the French,
are more adapt to
the English
Epistolary Style.
 Wherein consists the
Beauty of the
English Epistolary
Style?That it be short,
natural, easie, pithy,
and expressive.
 I shall follow your
Directions in every
Thing.
 I'll wait on you again
to Morrow.
 You'll oblige me.
 Your humble 
Servant, Sir.
 Farewel. Sir, I took the
Liberty of sending
for you;
 And am oblig'd to
you for your ready
Attendance.
 It is the least part of
my Duty,especially to so good a
Friend.
 But pray, Sir, what
ails you?
 I am very much out
of Order.
 I am very much
indispos'd.
 I have a violent
Head-ake:
 And a great Pain in
my Stomach.
 How long have you
been so?
 Since Yesterday.
 Did you sleep well
last Night?
 Not a Wink, I am
very restless.
 Have you an
Appetite?
 Not the least.
 I have an Aversion
to all Meat:
 But I have a
continual Thirst.
 Let me feel your
Pulse?
 You have a Fever.You must be let
Blood.
 Be sure you don't go
out.
 Keep your self warm,
and as much as
you can to Bed.
 Give me a Pen and
Ink.
 I will prescribe you
something.
 Send for this from 
the Apothecary's.
 Take it at ten a
Clock, & compose
your self to rest.
 Be blooded early in
the Morning:
 And about Ten I'll
wait on you again.
 I am oblig'd to you,
your Orders shall
be punctually
obey'd. How do you do to
Day, Sir?Somewhat better.
 I have had some
Rest.
 Have you been let
Blood?
 Yes, Sir, the Surgeon
is just gone.
 Let me see the Blood.
 There it is in the
Window.
 It was high Time.
 Your whole Mass of
Blood is corrupted.
 You must take a
Vomit to cleanse your
Stomach.
 And to Morrow I'll
give you a Purge.
 Does your Head ake
yet?
 Not so much as
Yesterday.
 More than this 
Morning.
 Your Fever has 
almost left you.
 The worst is past.You won't die this
Time.
 I hope to see you
abroad again in a
Day or two.
 I have a Stomach to
eat.
 May I eat a roasted
Chicken?
 That can't hurt you.
 What shall I drink?
 Some small Beer, and
after Dinner a Dish
of Tea.
 May I drink no Wine?
 The less the Better.
 However, you may
put a Glass of Sack
into your Beer.
 I'll see you again to
Morrow, & then I 
hope you will have
no further
Occasion for me.
 I am infinitely oblig'd
to you. Do you know that
young Lady, who
is walking there?
 No, I don't
remember I ever saw her:
 But she is very
handsome.
 She is reckoned a
great Beauty.
 She is the Tost of
the Town.
 How do you like
her?
 She is very beautiful.
Her Shape and Gate
are lovely and 
charming.
 She has fine Eyes,
and an excellent
Carriage.She has a free easie
Air, which is very
taking.
 Her Hair is as black
as a Coal.
 Her Skin is as white
as the driven Snow:
 And yet she has a
lively, fresh, and
ruddy Complexion.
 Her Lips are as red
as Coral, and her
Teeth as white as
Ivory.
 She has a well set
Neck.
 Her Breasts are of a
good Size;
 And as clear as 
Chrystal.
 Her Arms are like
Alabaster.
 What do you think
of her?
 I think she is a
perfect Beauty.
 She is incomparable.
 And yet with all this
Treasure of Beauty
she can't get a
Husband.Perhaps her Temper
does not answer
her Beauty.
 In every Respect.
 She is wise, discreet,
meek & courteous.
 Religious and
virtuous.
 Punctual in her
Duty to God and
Man.
 Skill'd in all Sciences.
 And pray what can
hinder this
excellent Person from
being sought by
every Body?
 What governs the
World.
