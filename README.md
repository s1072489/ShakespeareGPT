My own LLM built from scratch for the Hackclub YSWS Experimental LLM event!  

All my training data was from Project Gutenberg, their website can be found [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/).  

I wrote a few small things for myself so I though I'd put them here!  

Much of the code I used to train and run the model is from [Building LLMs from the Ground Up: A 3-hour Coding Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quh7z1q7-uc).
