 <head>THE SURUEYORS DIALOGUE, 
BETWEENE A <font>FARMOR</font> , AND A <font>SURUEYOR</font> : 
WHEREIN IS PROOUED, THAT SURUEYES ARE 
NECESSARY AND PROFITABLE BOTH FOR LORD 
AND TENANT: AND WHEREIN IS SHEWED 
HOW TENANTS OUGHT TO BEHAUE 
THEMSELUES TOWARDS 
THEIR LORDS.</head> 

 <head> <font>THE FIRST BOOKE.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I am glad I haue so happily met
with you, for if I be not mistaken, 
you are a Surueyor of Land.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Surueyor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Admit it so, Sir, what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue heard much euill of the profession, 
and to tell you my conceit plainely, I thinke the 
same both euill and vnprofitable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seeme to be but a yong man in yeeres, 
and are you so deeply seene in the abuse of this 
<font>Faculty</font> , that you can so peremptorily condemne it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call it you a <font>Faculty</font> ? What meane you 
by that word?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Abilitie to performe a thing vndertaken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then this faculty of yours, I say, is a vaine 
facultie, and a needlesse worke vndertaken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speake you this by coniecture, by report 
of others, or by due experience of your owne?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I speake indeede, as induced to the opinion 
I hold, by all the three reasons.
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then needs must you be eyther parciall or
malicious in the first two, and deceiued in the third. 
For he that speaketh by coniecture, hath not 
experience, &amp; he that speaketh by report, is as a truncke 
to conuey an vncertaine sound to the eares of 
others: and if you speake by experience, then haue 
you a pretence to haue skill in the arte; and by your 
owne experience it seemeth, you condemne your 
selfe to haue abused the same, and so condemne a 
generall necessary profession, in respect of your 
owne particular error in the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, I am willingly vnskilfull in that 
contemptible vanity. But my experience groweth, 
by tasting of the euill that hath followed the 
execution of the thing, by some like vnto your selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a generall condemnation, rashly
pronounced against all, for the abuse of some, and 
they only spew out greatest scandals, that are by 
examination, in this businesse found most deceitfull 
against their Lords, and therefore no maruell though 
the profession be contemned and condemned, of 
such as are to be condemned: for the offendor 
cannot speake well of the apprehender, nor scarcely of 
the most iust Iudge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speake as if you knew some abuse in 
me: I tell you, you do me wrong to attach me so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Belike you thinke it free for you to censure 
other men at your pleasure, and to iudge them after 
your own vaine conceit, and yet no reply must take 
hold of your vayne quarrell, that riseth of meere 
malice against the innocent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Innocent? How can that be, when you 
pry into mens tytles and estates, vnder the name 
(forsooth) of Surueyors, whereby you bring men 
and matter in question often times, that would (as 
long time they haue) lye without any question. And 
<pagebreak id="3" />
oftentimes you are the cause that men lose their
land: and sometimes they are abridged of such 
liberties as they haue long vsed in Mannors; and 
customes are altred, broken, and sometimes 
peruerted or taken away by your meanes: And aboue 
all, you looke into the values of mens lands, 
whereby the Lords of Mannors do rack their tenants 
to a higher rent and rate then euer before: and 
therefore not only I, but many poore tenants else 
haue good cause to speake against the profession.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be you not offended at the comparison 
which I will make to your allegations. Why should 
not such persons as are inhibited by the lawes of the 
Realme, to commit certaine acts within the 
common wealth, cry out against them, that by the same 
lawes are appoynted Magistrates and Officers to see 
these lawes executed vpon them, as Roagues, 
Beggers, and other like vagabonds? for if such officers 
and ouerseers were not, these offensiue persons 
might haue their wills: so would it follow, that men 
of peace, and good members of the 
Commonwealth, should be endangered to be sacked of that 
they haue, by such lewd persons. Necessary 
therefore it is, that there should be such as should see 
vnto, informe, punish, and reforme these. And by 
your assertions you may as well intend, vnder like 
reason, against keeping of Courts in a Mannor, 
wherein many abuses are found out, reformed, and 
punished, which without such Courts would lye 
smothered, festering so long, that there would be 
few sound members left within the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seemes, you compare tenants of 
Mannors, that are (many of them) honest, ciuill, and 
substanciall men, to Roagues, and vagabonds. 
You forget your selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My plaine words are, that as well these euill
<pagebreak id="4" />
members of the common wealth may speake 
against the Surueyors of the common wealth, which 
(to speake only of the vnder officers) are the Iustices 
of the peace, Constables, and such like, as may 
tenants of a Mannor speake against the surueying of 
their lands within the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That were strange; for by the one, the 
whole state of the kingdome is kept in peace, and 
by the other, many millions disturbed, that might 
liue quietly in their Farmes, tenements, houses, 
and lands, that are now dayly troubled with your 
so narrow looking thereinto, measuring the 
quantity, obseruing the quality, recounting the value, 
and acquainting the Lords with the estates of all 
mens liuings, whose auncesters did liue better with 
little, then we can do now with much more, because 
by your meanes rents are raysed, &amp; lands knowne 
to the vttermost Acre, fines inhaunced farre higher
then euer before measuring of land and 
surueying came in, and therefore I thinke you cannot 
but confesse, that other men, as well as I, haue good 
cause to speake of you and your profession, as I 
doe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue that the force of your strongest
arguments is as before I sayd, your feare and 
vnwillingnes that the Lord of the Mannor, vnder 
whom, and in whose land you dwell, should know 
his owne: and that you thinke it better for you, 
that he should continue still ignorant of what he 
hath, and that your estates should be alwayes 
hidden, and what iniury you doe should be 
concealed, then that he should be acquainted with what 
you hold, and your abuses, incrochments, 
vsurpations, intentions, and wrongs discouered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, we acknowledge that the Lord ought 
to haue his rent, and that is all, and our seruices at 
<pagebreak id="5" />
his Courts, but the land we haue, is our owne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Howsoeuer you may accompt them yours, 
yet the Lord hath such an interest and propertie 
in them, as he may also call them his, nay, I may 
say, you are not in such sort your owne, but next 
vnder the King, you may be sayd to be the Lords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fye vpon you, will you bring vs to be 
slaues? neither lawe, nor reason, least of all 
religion can allow what you affirme, and therefore 
as I before conceiued, so I may now protest, that 
you, and such as you are, are euen the cords 
whereby poore men are drawne into seruitude and 
slauery, and therefore I say againe, it is pitty any of 
you haue any imployment in a Common wealth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Sir, because I say you are in some 
sort the Lords? I tell you, that I mistake it nothing 
at all: for as the King is Supreme head and Prince, 
and defendour of all his Subiects, so vnder the 
King is euery Lord of a Mannor chiefe and head 
ouer his Tenants, namely, vnder <comment type="compiler">CORRECTED INTO ouer BY HAND</comment> such 
as hold of 
him: And he hath a kinde of commaund, and 
superior power ouer them, as they are his Tenants, 
and for that cause he is called, and they doe
acknowledge him to be their Lord. And what doth 
the word <font>Lord</font> import, but a Ruler or Gouernor? 
If he be your Lord, then are you his, to be 
gouerned in causes determineable within the Mannor, 
and as I will heereafter prooue, the Lord of the 
Mannor may commaund his Tenants to 
accompanie him into the Field against the enemyes of 
the King, by reason of some tenures, and they are 
to follow and be commanded and directed by him, 
and if they refuse the seruice, the Lord may distraine
for it, or may enter vpon their Lands, and resume 
it as his owne in some case; so that I may well say, 
that in a sort, euen your lands and your selues are the 
<pagebreak id="6" />
Lords. The vse and occupation is yours, but if the 
Land were so yours as were none aboue you, you 
might then call it yours: but so is none, but the 
Kingdome which the King holdeth of none but of 
God. And no man is so absolute within the 
Kingdome, but he holdeth his land of some Mannor, or 
person, or of the King. And of whom such land is 
holden, the same is called the Lord of that land after 
a sort, because it is held of him by some kind of rent
or seruice, and by possibility this land may come 
vnto, and by law be cast vpon the Lord of whom it is 
holden, as if you be so willing as you seeme to talke 
of these mysteries, you shall anon perceiue. And 
therfore you can not but say, that the land and your 
selues are in some sort the Lords. And therfore is it 
not lawfull for the Lord of the Mannor, to enquire 
and examine of the things in those kinds belonging 
vnto him? And if there be cleane and plaine dealing 
among tenants, they need not feare who looke into 
their lands and estates. But if there be deceits and 
wrongs against the Lord, policie willeth you to 
banish any man, and to barre all the meanes that may 
discouer them, though equitie and honestie be 
contented to discouer all things to the manifestation of 
truth. Are not these the matters of chiefe 
importance that disquiet you? The measuring of your
lands, the obseruation of the quality, and 
estimating the value of your lands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is true: for these are the causes that our 
rents are increased, and our fines raysed, and this 
would the Lord neuer do, if such as you did not 
inkindle the Lords desire, by your too seuere 
scrutations, examinations, impositions, &amp; imputations: 
for were the Lords of Mannors ignorant of these
things, as in former times, poore tenants might 
haue things at the rate they had in former times.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My friend, if I compare you to a dead 
Image, be not offended, for I perceiue you haue 
eyes to see, and yet you see not, you haue a heart to 
vnderstand, and yet your vnderstanding is amisse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am beholden to you Sir, to make me 
worse then a beast, for a beast hath the things you 
say I want: how prooue you what you haue sayd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because you impute your great impositions
vnto the acte of an honest Surueyor, when I will 
assure you and prooue, that the cause is in and of 
your selues.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then in deede you might account vs 
brutish, if we would worke our owne woe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue, though you may be a good worldly
Farmer, you are but a meane obseruer of the course 
and carriage of things passing dayly vnder your 
nose. He that hath seeing eyes and an 
vnderstanding mind, may easily see and perceiue, that there 
is no Mannor, nay, no Farme, be it great, or little, 
farre off, or neere hand, but hath bin, and dayly is 
discouered, by priuate intelligencers, lurking in or 
neere the same, prying into estates, ayming at the
quantity, wide, short, or ouer, seldome hitting 
right, obseruing also the quallity, and glauncing 
at the value of euery mans land, and therefore 
secretly and vnder-hand do informe the Lords of the 
Farme, and they being credulous ouermuch, and 
not a little couetous, build their demaunds both 
of rents and fines, vpon these most deceiueable 
informations, whereby the Lord is abused, and
the Tenant wronged; whereas were the things 
seene, viewed, and surueyed by a iudicious and 
faithfull Surueyor, who vpon due consideration, 
and discreet obseruation of all particulars, giues 
in a true and indifferent certificate vnto the Lord, 
vsing rather his vttermost indeuour to moderate 
<pagebreak id="8" />
and mitigate the Lords excessiue demands, then 
aggrauating the validity beyond reason or a good
conscience, you would be of another minde, and 
I protest, I hold that Surueyor a very bad man, that 
will either for affection or bribe carry a parciall hand 
betweene the Lord and his Tenants: yet sith he 
holdeth as it were the beame of the ballance, he should 
rather giue the better waight to the weakest, 
respecting nothing but a charitable course to be held by 
the Lord, for whom he trauaileth with the Tenant, 
against whom if he speake not, he shall be often 
suspected of the Lord to be parciall. But if there be 
equall consideration on all sides, the Lord will 
beleeue the Surueyor deales iustly, and the Tenant rest
satisfyed, willingly to leaue, or rudely to accept, as 
his owne iudgement agreeth or disagreeth with the 
things propounded. For this haue I obserued, that 
oftentimes Tenants consider not when they are 
kindly vsed, neither see they at all times when they 
are abused.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly I beleeue you in part: for indeede 
there are euen amongst vs, in y=e= Mannor wherein I 
dwell, officious fellowes, that to procure the Lords 
good opinion, will pry into mens estates, &amp; indeede 
as you say, into y=e= quantity, quality, &amp; value of mens 
lands, and giue false information oftentimes, and I 
know it is a foule abuse, and of the two, I rather 
allow a true suruey, then a false report: for such fond 
fellowes as are thus busy in other mens causes, are
of all me~ least to be beleeued; for they speake always
for affection or gaine: for they wil estimate <comment type="compiler">CORRECTED INTO       
extenuate BY HAND</comment> the value 
of them they loue, or haue gaine by, and aggrauate 
the same, as their hope is of the Lords reward: all 
this I know without your report. But what is that 
to the thing you charge poore tenants withall, that 
they are the cause of their owne hard measure? 
<pagebreak id="9" />
cleere your selfe of this slander.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That can I easily do by experience, and I 
thinke I shall haue the whole world to witnes it for 
your further satisfaction, who can not your selfe be 
ignorant of the same thing; for you haue in part 
confessed the thing: for the former Informers, of whom 
you last spake, are euen tenants themselues, yet I 
accuse then not all, nay, I excuse none in particular: for 
I haue seene and obserued among them a kind of 
madnes, as I may call it, but in the best sence it is a 
kind of ambitious, or rather auaricious emulation, 
wherein they striue one to outstrip another in giuing 
most: as where my selfe haue had businesse of this 
nature, namely, of letting, setting, or selling of land 
for yeeres or liues, being, or neere being
determined, in farmes or other like, whereby the Lord hath
bin at liberty to dispose therof at his will, for best
aduantage, by choice of a new tenant, Proclamation to
that effect hath bin made in ope~ court, where I haue
seene, and it is dayly in vse, that one wil outbid 
another, as at an outcry in <font>London</font> , in so much as I haue 
wondred at their emulation, and could not haue 
asked what they haue raysed it vnto themselues. And 
should any that is in authority in this case (who in 
duty is not to hinder the Lord, or the Lord himselfe) 
inhibit such hot spirits to clyme as high for the Lords 
aduantage, as the ladder of their owne will, and
supposed ability will reach? This is not as one Swallow 
in a Summer, but they are many, and euery where 
Winter and Summer, and yet are other me~ accused 
and condemned for the~ and their faults, if there will 
be a fault in itselfe: but I should thinke it greater 
madnes for a Lord, wilfully to refuse what is so
voluntarily offered, and so willingly giuen. Now, who
is the cause of raysing rents and fines?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know, such rash &amp; ouerforward me~ there 
<pagebreak id="10" />
are in the world not a few, almost in euery Mannor, 
who are especially pricked forward to this 
emulation through enuy and auarice, hauing meanes to 
atchieue their desires. But this bidding and 
out-bidding is in things, wherein the Lord is at his
libertie to take a tenant whom he list. But in customary
tenements of inheritance the case is otherwise, 
where the rent is and the fine (for the most part) 
certaine, what needes the Lord haue this surueyd, 
or any free-hold lands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is fit the Lord should know what his tenant
holdeth, be it free or customary, though at this day 
there be a needlesse nicenesse in some free-holders 
of Mannors, who seeme to conceale their estates, 
and to kick against the view of their lands: but if they 
knew what they did, they would reforme that error.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call it you an error, for a free-holder to 
refuse to shew his estate to the Lord, or not to suffer 
his land to be surueyd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I may well so call it, nay, I may call it a great
fault, or an iniury done against the Lord, and 
hurtfull to himselfe. There is none (it may be you know 
it) that holdeth of any Lord land, but he holdeth the 
same by some kind of rent or seruice, and when he 
comes to take vp his land after the death of his 
auncester, or vpon purchace, but he doth or ought to 
do homage and fealty, or one of them, vnto the Lord 
of whom he holds it; the doing whereof, how 
ceremonious it is, if you be a Tenant to any such land, 
you know, and wherein he maketh a solemne vow 
and oth, to be true Tenant vnto the Lord for the 
land he holdeth. And sometimes the Tenant of 
such a Tenure, is forced to be ayded by his Lord for
the same land, if he be impleaded for it: now, if such a
Tenant refuse to shew his estate, or to permit his 
land to be seene, how performeth he his oath, to be 
<pagebreak id="11" />
true Tenant, and to do such seruices as are due vnto 
the Lord? among which, this, of permitting the Lord 
to know his owne, is not the least, nay, he ought by 
his oth of fidelity, to further it by all meanes, both by 
his proper knowledge and euidence, not only his 
owne, but other mens lands, and thereby he shall 
not only not preiudice himselfe, but he shall 
fortifie his title so much the more, by hauing his 
euidence inrolled, and his land recorded in the Lords 
booke of Suruey, that when his heire shall take vp 
the land, or he alien the same, it appeareth that he is 
true Tenant vnto such lands for such rent, and for 
such seruices: but there be so many scruples thrust
into mens heads, by such as haue a pretended skill 
in matters of policie in this kinde, and Lords of 
Mannors haue bene so remisse in taking knowledge 
of the things in this maner appertaining vnto them, 
that questions of Titles and tenures are dayly had 
and moued, to the great trouble oftentimes both of 
Lord and Tenant, as is seene by experience dayly as 
well of land holde~ of the King, as of inferior Lords, 
which may be reconciled, if Tenants were not too 
curious, and Lords too negligent. Besides this, there 
are other reasons to mooue the Lord to know what 
land is holden of him, and by what title, rent, and 
seruice: for free-holders may forfeit their land, and 
their land may escheat vnto the Lord: if then he
should be ignorant what land it is, where it lyes, and
how much it is, he may be easily abused for want of
records: and so are many Lords of Mannors, who for 
want of due knowledge of their tenants and of their 
land &amp; tenures, other men are intitled to their right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You haue said more then I heard or dreamed 
of, and it holdeth in some sort by reason, how it is by 
law I cannot dispute: but in all y=t= you haue said, you 
haue not satisfied me in the thing before I spake of, 
<pagebreak id="12" />
touching the fines of customary tenants of 
inheritance, which (as I said before) haue bin of late raised 
far higher then in former times, by your surueyors.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You strike alwayes one string, and I find the 
sound of your meaning; you would always be as 
easily charged in your fines as might be: and in that I 
blame you not, it is euery mans case to beare as light 
a burden as he can. But if you remember what I 
spake before, touching the cause of this raysing of 
fines, where I prooued it came most by your owne 
meanes, you may be the sooner satisfied in this, for 
it is in nature like the former. Although this kind of 
Tenant hath seldom any competitor to emulate his 
offer, because the Tenant leaueth co~monly one 
either in right of inheritance, or by surrendor to 
succeed him, and he by custome of the Mannor is to be 
accepted Tenant, alwayes prouided, he must agree 
with the Lord, if the custome of the Mannor hold
not the fine certaine, as in few it doth: now this
composition is commonly made by demaund of 
the Lord, and offer of the Tenant. The Lord asketh 
according to his conceit of the value of the thing, 
and eyther his knowledge must arise by his owne 
experience, or by information: the information 
is eyther by secret intelligence of some officious 
neighbour, or by due iudgement of an indifferent 
Surueyour, namely, such a one as carieth equall
respects to Lord and Tenant. And although, as you
alledge, former times did affoord Tenants more 
fauour in rating and arbitrating fines, as you 
suppose, if you consider it well, it is now as then it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There you much mistake you: for I will 
shew by auncient Court rolls, that the fine of that 
which is now twenty pound, was then but thirteene 
shillings foure pence, and yet will you say they are  
now as they were then?
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, and I thinke I erre little in it. For if you
consider the state of things then and now, you shall 
find the proportion little differing: for so much are 
the prices of things vendible by Farmers now 
increased, as may well be said to exceed the prices then, as 
much as twenty pound exceedeth xiii. s. iiii. d.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speake farre from truth, and I 
maruell you will erre so much, pretending to be a man 
of that reach, that men imploy you to ouer-reach 
others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To shew you then an instance, looke into the
Chronicle in the time of <font>Henry</font> the sixt, and you shall 
finde, that a quarter of Wheate was sold at <font>Royston</font> 
in <font>Hartfordshire</font> for twelue pence: and I trust, if you 
be a Farmer, you are a Corne-seller, and I thinke, if a 
man offer you thirty times as much for a quarter, 
you will say it is better worth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it possible that Corne was then and 
there so cheape, and to rise since to this rate? it is 
very strange.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all: for since there grew such
emulation among Farmers, that one would outbid another,
(which in the beginning was little seene) it grew at 
length, that he that bought deare, must sell deare, 
and so grew the prices of things by degrees to this 
rate as now they be, and a Farmer gets as much by 
his Farme now, as then he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You erre therein, I assure you: for else could
Farmers keepe as good houses &amp; hospitality now, as 
they did then, and alas, you see how vnable they be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is true, and the reason is manifest: for 
where in those dayes Farmers and their wiues were 
content with meane dyet, and base attire, and held 
their children to some austere gouernment, without 
haunting Alehouses, Tauerns, Dice, Cards, &amp; vaine 
delites of charge, the case is altred: the <font>Husbandman</font>
<pagebreak id="14" />
will be equall to the <font>Yoman</font> , the <font>Yoman</font> to the 
<font>Gentleman</font> , the <font>Gentleman</font> to the <font>Squire</font> , the <font>Squire</font> 
his 
Superiour, and so the rest, euery one so farre exceeding 
the corruptions held in former times, that I will 
speake without reprehension, there is at this day 
thirty times as much vainely spent in a family of like 
multitude and quality, as was in former ages,
whereof I speake. And therefore impute not the rate of
grounds to a wrong cause, for to tell you truly, both 
Lord and Tenant are guilty in it: and yet they 
may be both content, for they are as the Sea and the 
Brookes: for as the Riuers come from the Sea, so 
they runne into the Sea againe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To tell you truly, you haue sayd more 
then I haue heard, and indeed it stands with some 
reason; and you haue in part satisfyed me, that the 
cause of our complaint is not so grieuous, as I and 
infinite other haue supposed it. Yet to tell you as I 
and others haue found, there be some of your 
profession haue either none at all or little, or very hard 
consciences, and for the most part such as haue least 
skill: and such indeede I thinke vnnecessary for 
Lord, or Tenant; for they cannot but abuse the 
one or other by their reports: and the records which
they make, may breede quarrell many yeares after. 
And therefore as the Surueyor is a member (as 
you hold) not only tolerable, but necessary, I wish 
there were fewer, and they honest, iust, and skilfull: 
for to tell you truly, we haue thought among vs 
Country-men, that there are more then can be 
imployed, as it seemeth by their publike declarations
of their wa~t of worke: for as I haue passed through 
<font>London</font> , I haue seene many of their Bils fixed vpon 
posts in the streetes, to solicite men to affoord them 
some seruice: which argueth, that either the trade 
decayeth, or they are not skilfull, that beg  
<pagebreak id="15" />
imployment so publikely: for, <font> <foreign>Vino vendibili suspensa hedera 
non est opus</foreign> </font> . A good workeman needs not stand in
the streetes.

LORD OF A MANNOR, AND A SURUEYOR:
WHEREIN IS INTREATED OF THE STATE OF A MANNOR, OF THE 
PARTS AND PROFITS THEREUNTO BELONGING: AND 
HOW THE LORD OF A MANNOR OUGHT TO 
DEALE WITH HIS TENANTS.</head> 

 <head> <font>THE SECOND BOOKE.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Friend, of late I met with a Tenant
of mine, who told me you are a 
Surueyor of Land.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Surueyor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue beene, and am sometimes 
imployd in that kind of seruice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue at this time some occasion to vse 
the ayd of one of your faculty: and I haue heard 
by my Tenant, that your skill and diligence may 
satisfie my desire therein.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Surueyor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall do mine endeuour wherein you 
please to commaund me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There bee many, I know, that beare the 
name of <font>Surueyors</font> , but when they are put to it, they 
come far short of some principall poynts required 
in the absolute performance of the worke, and 
eyther leaue it halfe done, or so shuffle it vp, as the
Lord is abused, and the Tenants wronged, by the
blind and vncertaine returnes of the Surueyors 
trauailes: for a Lord of a Mannor knoweth not, 
but by such as he vseth therein, the estate of things, 
and how the particulars stand betweene the Lord 
and his Tenants. If the Lord of the Mannor haue 
neuer so good a mind to deale well with his
<pagebreak id="39" />
Tenants, and the Tenants be neuer so inclinable to do 
true duty to their Lord, they may be both misled by 
an vnskilfull Surueyor, to the vniust 
condemnation or suspition of both. And therefore I thinke it 
behoueth men of worth, that haue vse of such as you 
are, to be well assured of the skill and ability which 
you pretend to haue in your profession; and because
I haue no further experience of you then the bare 
report of my Tenant, I must intreate you to 
discourse vnto me a little of your knowledge of such 
particulars, as are to be considered in the absolute 
suruey of a Mannor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Surueyor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you seeme to oppose me farre, and 
the thing you demaund, will require a longer time, 
and a larger discourse, then either my leysure, or 
peraduenture my present memory of euery 
particular will readily permit. And it may be, that you 
that pretend little knowledge in the arte, may 
apprehend both the truth of the thing, and an error 
committed in the performance, as well as he that 
assumeth the title of a Surueyor, although neither 
your leysure nor your quality may in reason permit 
you the trauaile in it: for I know many Gentlemen 
of good woorth, that haue the speculatiue parts of
the whole, and the practick of the deepest, and yet
they will not be seene to tread that path that a
Surueyor is forced to do, in the whole businesse. You
haue the matter and subiect whereon a Surueyor
worketh, and without which a Surueyor loseth both
arte and name, and therefore you cannot be
altogether ignorant of the things required in the 
businesse, as the Master of a feast can not dresse the 
dainties, but the Cooke, yet can the Master reproue 
the Cooke if he do not his duty therein.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou sayst true in thy comparison: but 
for my part, although indeed I haue Land, and I 
<pagebreak id="40" />
know how many Mannors I haue, their names, 
and where they lye, and the most of my Tenants, 
and theyr rents, and if you should erre in these, it
may be I might be able to reprooue you, yet for 
matters of farther search, I assume not to be 
skilfull, for then I needed not your seruice, as of 
quantities, qualities, values, validities of estates, 
tenures, customes, and other things incident to a
Mannor, which are not in all Mannors alike, the 
true discouery whereof belongeth to the 
Surueyors office, yet none but such as are truly skilfull, 
can sufficiently discharge the duty heerein required: 
and therefore by your leaue, you shall briefly (I will 
not be tedious) relate vnto me what you can say 
of the definition of a Mannor, whereof it consisteth, 
how, when, and by whom it was erected, with 
other such things as shall be expedient for the Lord 
of a Mannor to know the particulars whereof I 
will leaue to your relation, and first tell me <font>What
a Mannor is</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suruey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sith you will needs diue into my poore 
skill, by your opposall, and sith indeed I do in some 
measure professe the arte, wherein I thinke no man 
is or hath bene so exquisit, but hee might erre in 
some poynt or part much or little, as in other artes, 
yet to answere your demaunds, I will as briefly as 
I can, satisfye your desire. And first, where you 
demaund what a Mannor is, <font>A Mannor in substance 
is of Lands, Wood, Meddow, Pasture, and Arable: It 
is compounded of demesnes and seruices of long 
continuance</font> . As touching the beginning of a <font>Mannor</font> , and 
the institution thereof, the beginning of Mannors 
was, when the King gaue Lands vnto his followers, 
in such quantity, as did exceed the proportion of  
a mans manurance and occupation, as a thousand, 
two thousand Acres more or lesse: which quantity 
<pagebreak id="41" />
of Land being at that time as it were in a lump or 
<font>Chaos</font> , without any distinction of parts, or qualities 
of Land, he to whom such Land was giuen to hold 
to him and his heires for euer, enfeoffed some others 
in parts thereof, as one in ten, another in twenty, 
and some in more, some in lesse Acres, and in 
consideration of such feoffements, euery of these were 
to do the feoffer some kind of seruice, as he and they 
agreed vpon, reseruing such a part vnto himselfe, 
as he might conueniently occupy in his owne hands,
and by this meanes the Land thus giuen by the 
King, and thus proportioned out to others by the 
<font>Donee</font> , became to be called a <font>Mannor</font> . And he that 
was thus inuested in this Land by the King, was in 
respect of such as he infeoffed, called the <font>Lord</font> , and 
such as were infeoffed, were called <font>Tenants</font> : <font>Lord</font> ,
in respect of gouernement and commaund; and 
<font>Tenants</font> , in respect of their tenures, and manner of 
holding vnder the Lord whom they were to obey.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But when or about what time was this 
erection of Mannors?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I take it, and as it seemeth, in the time of 
the <font>Normans</font> : for among the <font>Saxons</font> was no such 
name as the name <font>Mannor</font> , yet the thing euen in 
substance was then, for they had <font>Demeisnes</font> , and 
seruices in substance, but the demeisnes they 
called <font>Inlandt</font> , and the seruices <font>Vtlandt</font> , so that it 
differeth only in name, but in Iurisdiction little or 
nothing at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereof is it called a <font>Mannor</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is some differe~ce of opinio~s whe~ce the
word <font>Mannor</font> should be deriued: it is in Latin called
<font>Manerium</font> , yet a word not vsed among the <font>Romans</font> or
ancient <font>Latins</font> , &amp; therfore to find the <font>etimon</font> by it, can 
not be: for the word is vsed among our Lawyers, as
many other made words are, which haue bin termes
<pagebreak id="42" />
raised by our Lawes, &amp; are not elsewhere in vse; and
therefore the neerest way to find the signification of 
the word, is by the quality of the thing; so that 
some hold, it should proceed of the Latine verbe, 
<font>Manere</font> , which signifieth to abide, or remayne in a 
place, as the Lord and his Tenants did in this, 
wherof the head house, or the Lords seate was called 
<font>Berrye</font> , which signifieth in the Saxon toong, a 
dwelling place, which continueth yet still in 
<font>Hartfordshire</font> , and in diuers other places, and is also taken 
sometimes <font>pro castro</font> , which was also the seate of the 
Lord of some Mannors. <font>Mannor</font> houses were also,
and yet are called in some places, <font>Halls</font> , as in <font>Essex</font> , 
and Northward: <font>Courts</font> and <font>Court-houses</font> 
Westward, as in <font>Somerset</font> , <font>Deuon</font> , <font>&amp;c.</font> as also <font>Mannor 
places</font> : all which are places of the Lords owne abode, 
and therefore it may not vnfitly be said, to take name 
of abiding or dwelling. Some thinke, and not 
improperly, that it taketh name of the French word 
<font> <foreign>Manemirer</foreign> </font> , which signifieth to till and manure the 
ground. And of the two, I take this latter to be the 
most proper deriuation of the word <font>Mannor</font> : for 
thereof are many chiefe houses of tillage, called 
<font> <foreign>Predia</foreign> </font> , Graunges. It may also take the name of <font>Mainer</font> ,
to gouerne and guide, because the Lord of the 
Mannor had the managing and direction of all his 
Tenants within the limits of his iurisdiction. Of these 
deriuations <font> <foreign>qualem mauis accipe</foreign> </font> : necessity tyes to 
neyther.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These significations of the word may 
stand all with sence, and much materiall it is not 
whence the word ariseth, but the likelyest is indeed
that which most agreeth with the propertie of the 
thing. But I haue within my Mannors sundry 
<font>mesuages</font> : whence is the name deriued?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of <font>meisus</font> , or <font>mesuager</font> , which is as much
<pagebreak id="43" />
to say, as <font>familiam administrare</font> , to gouerne a 
houshold: for euery of the Tenants had his family, and of 
diuers of them and of the Lords family did a 
Mannor consist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then no doubt, if a man haue a thousand 
Acres of Land more or lesse, to him and his heires, 
which lyeth in one intire peece, not yet diuided, may 
be diuided into parts, as a portion for the Lord 
himselfe, and some parcels to erect such mesuages 
for Tenants to do him seruice, as he may make a 
Mannor where none was before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, for although a man haue a 
competent quantity of Land in his manurance, and would 
conuert it to the end you speake of, were it neuer so 
great, and could establish many <font>mesuages</font> , and could 
erect whatsoeuer seruices, this would not become a 
<font>Mannor</font> , because all these must haue long 
continuance, which can not at this day be confirmed by any 
priuate man, but by the King only: but he may haue 
thereby a kind of <font>seignory</font> , a Lordship or 
gouernement in grosse ouer his Tenants by contract or 
couenant, but no <font>Mannor</font> . No man at this day can 
create a seruice or a tenure, or by any meanes rayse 
or erect a <font>Mannor</font> : for there must be very Lord and 
very Tenant in fee-simple, and that of auncient
co~mencement and continuance, or else it can inure 
no <font>Mannor</font> . For a man may haue demeisns to occupy,
and Tenants to do him seruices, and that of
continuance, and yet no Mannor. As if a man that had 
Land, did giue part of this Land in former time to 
some others in tayle to do him seruices, heere are 
demeisnes in the donor, and seruices in the donees, 
and a tenure: yet because there be not very Tenants 
in fee simple, it maketh no Mannor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether are all Lands holden of a 
Mannor, parcell of the same Mannor?
<pagebreak id="44" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Lands may be holden of a Mannor by
certaine seruices, the seruice may be parcell of the 
Mannor, and yet the Lands not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But may not this Land be made parcell 
of the Mannor at this day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By no other meanes but by <font>escheat</font> , for if the
Land fall vnto the Lord by escheat, then it comes 
parcell of the Mannor: for then is the <font>seruice</font> 
extinguished, and the Land commeth in place of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May not a man purchase Land that lyeth 
neere his Mannor, and annexe the same, and make 
it parcell of the Mannor, though it held not of the 
Mannor before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forraine Land newly purchased, though it 
lye within the precinct and bounds of the Mannor, 
can not be annexed, though the Tenant thereof be 
willing to do his seruices there: for this is in nature 
of a new creation of a tenure, which at this day the 
lawe will not admit, only the <font>King</font> by his prerogatiue 
may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What if it were tyed vnto the Lord of a 
Mannor for the payment of an annuity, is not the 
annuity then parcell of the Mannor? And if that 
Land be purchased by the Lord, and thereby 
extinguish the annuity, doth not that Land come in place 
of the annuity, and so become parcell of the 
Mannor, as the Land you spake of before, which by the
escheat ran in place of the seruice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The case is not alike: for the annuity was not
parcell of the Mannor, neither can it be by such 
meanes as you propound by the way of Mortgage. 
But in another sort it may: as if a Mannor be to be 
diuided into sundry parts, and because the parts fall 
out vnequall in value, there must a rent or annuity 
be apportioned to make vp the value, which rent 
becomes parcell of the Mannor.
<pagebreak id="45" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Mannor be diuided, as you say, and 
a rent allotted to one part, how can the rent be 
parcell of the Mannor, for as much as in my 
vnderstanding, the Mannor becommeth by this partition, to be 
no Mannor: for if there can be no addition to a 
Mannor, there can be no diuision of a Mannor, and 
yet the Mannor to continue still a Mannor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, of one Mannor may be made diuers 
at this day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How I pray you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If a Mannor descend to diuers partners, and
they make partition, and euery one hath demeisnes
and seruices, euery one hath a Mannor, and euery 
one may keepe a Court Baron.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What if a man make a feoffement vpon
conditions of parcell of his Mannor, or do graunt 
a Lease to another for life of part, or do intayle part, 
are not these parts still parcels of the Mannor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If parcels of a Mannor be once thus seuered,
they immediatly become no parcels thereof: yet 
may they all reuert and become parcels of the 
Mannor againe, as if the condition of the feoffement be 
broken, if the Tenant for life dye, or the limitation 
of the entayle discontinue for want of heires.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then a man may say, that though such 
Land be not, yet the reuersions are parcels of the 
Mannors.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it is intended.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, you haue reasonably well satisfied 
me in these poynts, yet would I gladly haue some 
further satisfaction of some other matters, touching 
the state and profits of a Mannor. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would be willing to do my best to content
you, but you partly hinder me of other businesse. 
What else would you know? I wish breuity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It shall be so, neither shall you lose your 
<pagebreak id="46" />
labour: for I meane to vse you, if my future 
satisfaction be answerable to this former. May euery 
Mannor keepe a <font>Court Baron</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Euery Mannor in the beginning, no doubt, 
might keepe a Court Baron, and so it may at this day,
vnlesse the Mannor be so dismembred, as it wanteth 
that which may warrant the keeping thereof: for if 
all the freeholders of a Mannor do escheat, or all but 
one, the Mannor is then disabled to keepe a <font>Court 
Baron</font> , for the Court can not be kept without suters, 
which are the freeholders.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then me thinks, the Mannor loseth the 
name of a Mannor: for if it lose the quality, it is not 
the thing, no more then a <font>logge</font> that had fire, can be 
sayd a <font>fire-logge</font> , when the fire is extinct.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is true, it becomes no Mannor, but a 
<font>Seignory</font> , hauing no power to keepe a Court Baron.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An ignorant Surueyor, I see, may be easily
deceyued, in terming that which is no Mannor, a 
Mannor, and that no Mannor, which indeede is a 
Mannor. But satisfie me in this one thing. A man 
hauing two Mannors lying together, and the one 
of them is decayd, and hath lost his power to keepe 
a <font>Court Baron</font> , and the Lord is willing to haue the 
Tenants of both these Mannors to do their suites 
and seruices to one Court, namely, to that which 
standeth yet in force, and that me thinks were good 
for the Tenants to ease them, and it would preserue 
the Lords right without preiudice to any: for then 
one homage would serue both, and both serue as 
one, one Bayly, and other officers, as if it were an 
intire Mannor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet this can not bee, for this vnion of the
Mannors can not extinguish theyr seuerall 
distinctions, for they will be still two in nature, 
howsoeuer the Lord couet to make them one in name, and  
<pagebreak id="47" />
the more powerfull <font>Mannor</font> hath no warrant to call 
the Tenants of the decayd <font>Seignory</font> , but euery act 
done in one to punish an offendor, in the other is 
trauersable, and therefore it is but lost labour to 
practise any such vnion; if it be considered by such as 
are forced to seruice in this kind, they may refuse it: 
yet if they will voluntarily submit themselues to such 
a nouation, and the same be continued without 
contradiction, time may make this vnion perfect, and 
of two distinct Mannors in nature, make one in 
name &amp; vse, and I do not thinke but such there are.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then is there, as it seemeth, no meane to 
annexe two Mannors in one, howsoeuer necessary 
it were both for the Lord and Tenants.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, two Mannors may become as one, 
if one Mannor do hold of another, and it escheat to 
the Lord, the escheated Mannor may be annexed, 
and vnited, and of two distinct Mannors become 
one, if the Lord will, in vse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am answered in this poynt, and it 
standeth with more reason indeed then the former: now 
I pray you tell me what things do properly belong 
to a Mannor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There do belong to a Mannor, <font>Lands,
Tenements, rents</font> , and <font>seruices</font> , as I shewed you before in
part, which are a parcell in <font>demeisne</font> , and parcell in 
<font>seruice</font> .

 <head> <font>THE THIRD BOOKE.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are happily met here againe, Sir, 
haue you euer since had conference with 
my Landlord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is a man of good vnderstanding, and 
very inquisitiue of things of profite. And yet to tell 
you truly, he is a good man to his tenants.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suruey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Loue him then, for such deserue loue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is beloued of his tenants indeede: for 
they will go, and ride, and fight for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is the part of good tenants, and an
argument of a good Landlord. But fare you well, I 
cannot now stay, I haue bene long letted by your 
Landlord and you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you presently to vndertake the suruey 
of my Landlords Lordships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am now going about it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke it be in your choice where to 
begin, let me therefore intreate you to begin with 
<font>Beauland</font> , a Mannor of his here at hand, whereof I 
am both tenant and Bayly: and therfore I will and 
must attend you, and yeeld you my best ayd, both by 
my trauell, information, and records of the Ma~nor.
<pagebreak id="84" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Keepe you the Lords records?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The key is in my keeping that leads to the 
Chest, but the key of the Chest is in my Lords 
keeping: but I will send for it, that you may haue y=e= full 
view of the euidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it behooueth: Is it a large Mannor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Baylie.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is spacious in circuit, and of great 
apparance of Tenants, full of diuers commodities, 
both vnder and aboue the earth, as also of fishing, 
and fowling, and beareth not the name for nought: 
for the Mannor is faire, and very 
commodious.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be you then my guide: Is yonder it, with 
the faire house by the Woods side?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Baylie.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is it, and a stately house it is 
indeede.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seemes to be a large and loftie cage, if the 
Bird be answerable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Baylie.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What meane you by that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I meane, that a <font>Titmus</font> may harbour in a
<font>Peacockes</font> cage: and yet the cage maketh her not a 
<font>Peacocke</font> , but will be a <font>Titmus</font> , notwithstanding the 
greatnes of the cage: So if this loftie Pyle bee not 
equalized by the estate and reuenewes of the 
builder, it is as if <font>Paules steeple</font> should serue <font>Pancras</font> 
Church for a Belfrey.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Baylie.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke my Landlord sent you not 
insteade of surueying his Land, to deride his house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The house is beautifull and faire: I deride it 
not, you doe your selfe wrong in attaching mee, 
neither discommend I the builder. For he that hath 
gold enough, let him build a house of gold, with 
<font>Nero</font> , who made vnto it a pond <font> <foreign>Maris Iustar</foreign> </font> , and 
woods full of all kind of wild Beasts. <font>Publius Clodius</font> 
whom <font>Milo</font> slew, bought a house which cost him 
147000. <font>Sesterties</font> . Let Princes haue their Palaces, 
<pagebreak id="85" />
and great men, their pleasant seates: for the poorest 
will please his fancie, if he be wilfull. But to tell thee 
by the way, (for this is but idle communication) that 
I haue obserued in nothing more sudden and serious 
repentance, then for building: I could point out 
places and persons too with my finger, but what needs 
that? I wish their repentance could redeem the thing 
repented of, but it cannot, no more then <font>Quintus 
Curtius</font> could redeeme himself out of the deuouring
gulfe. We haue in our dayes many and great 
buildings, a comly ornament it is to the face of the earth. 
And were it not that the smoake of so many  
chimneyes, did raise so many duskie cloudes in the aire, to 
hinder the heate and light of the Sunne from earthly
creatures, it were the more tolerable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bayly</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay truly, I will excuse that fault, the
fire is made most in the kitchin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then it besmoketh not the hall, as old 
worthie houses did, whose kitchins smoake sent foorth 
cloudes of good meate, and showres of drinke for the 
poore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bayly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, Sir, that was a comfortable smoke: 
but <foreign>Tempora mutantur, &amp; omnia mutantur in illis</foreign> : 
no earthly thing continueth constant, but hath his 
change. Lo, Sir, now you are come to the house it 
selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, here is a pleasant ascent, neither too    
steepe, nor too flat, and of a good length. And now 
we are come to the top of the hill: here is a goodly 
prospect and pleasant. And these springs I like well. 
For a house without liuely water, is maymed: and 
the water is well conueyed, that it cannot annoy the 
foundation of the house, and yet serueth the most 
necessarie offices very commodiously: and I see the 
Conducts are made of earthen pipes, which I like 
farre better then them of Leade, both for sweetnes, 
<pagebreak id="86" />
and continuance vnder the ground. The trees are 
well placed about the walkes, but that they are 
somwhat too neere together, their branches confound 
one the other, they are but twenty foot, and I like 
better, thirty. It standeth warme and comfortable 
towards the South-east, to which the best lights are
made fitly to serue: but if the ground would haue 
serued, I like plaine South, the better point for the 
comfort of the Sunne, at all times of the yeere. And 
nature hath planted this wood most commodiously 
in the North side of the house. And it is delicately 
aduanced vpon the edge of the hill: it is not possible 
to seate a house more delightfully, for Winter and
Summer, in mine opinion. Now, if vpon view of the 
demeisnes, and the rest of the parts, it be not found 
like vnto a child borne in Chesshire, with a head 
bigger then the bodie, I shall like it well. Now to our 
businesse: you are Bayly, take this Precept, and 
summon the tenants to make their appearance, 
according to the purport of the same.
