mothers milke not wrung out of their nose yet, they knowe no more
how to behaue themselues in this honest and needeful calling of
Purse-taking, then I do to peece stockings.

their valor, before a worshipfull bench, their very lookes woulde
hang em, and they were indighted but for stealing of Egs.

be troubled with such Changelings, squat hart squat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tho.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus Butler.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I so suckling, so, sturre not nowe, If the peering 
Rogues
chance to goe ouer you, yet sturre not younger Brothers call you
em, and haue no more forecast, I am ashamd of you, these are such
whose fathers had neede leaue them money, euen to make them
ready withall, for by this hiltes, they haue not wit to butten theyr
sleeues without teaching, close, squat close. Now if the lot of
hanging do fall to my share, so, then the Fathers old man drops for  
his
young maisters. If it chance it chances, and when it chaunces, 
heauen and the Sheriffe send me a good rope, I wold not go vp the
lather twice for any thing, in the meane time preuentions

Were by three knaues robd of three hundred pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A shrewd losse berlady sir, but your good worship  
may

man to saue hors-meat and mans meat at your Inne at night, &amp;
lose three hundred pound in a morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirha, I say I ha lost three hundred pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I say sir, I wish all miserable knights might  
bee
serued so: For had you kept halfe a dozen tall fellowes, as a man of
your coat should do, they woulde haue helpt now to keep your 
money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tell me sir, why lurkt you in that tree?

and vnwieldy, not being able to doe as I would, as muche as to
say, Rescue you (right Worshipfull,) I like an honest man, one
of the Kings liege people, and a good subiect
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ser.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A sayes well Sir.
Got me vp to the top of that tree: The tree (if it could speake)
would beare me witnesse, that there I might see which way the
knaues tooke, then to tell you of it, and you right worshipfullie
to send hue to cry after em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it so.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay then I tell thee they tooke into this wood.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I tell thee (setting thy worsh. knighthood     
aside)
he lyes in his throat that saies so: Had not one of them a white
Frocke? Did they not bind your worships knighthoode by the
thumbs? then fagoted you and the fool your man, back to back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He sayes true.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then so truly, came not they into this wood, but
tooke ouer the Lawnes, &amp; left Winno steeple on the left hand.

heare Galants, I ha not taught you this trade to get your liuings
by. Vse it not, for if you doe, though I scapt by the Nut tree, be

Theres a hundred pounds for you, how you shall bestow it, Ile
giue you instructions. But do you heare, Looke you goe not to

my vices. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shall she be, prethee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ilf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Lady, no widdow, nor no waiting gentlewoman, for

Ladyes may larde their husbands heads, Widdows will
Woodcocks make, &amp; chambermayds of serui~gme~ learn that, theyle ner
forsake. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Went.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who wilt thou wed then, prethe?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From these Crabes will I gather sweetnesse: wherin 
Ile
imitate the Bee, that sucks her hony, not from the sweetest
flowers, but Timb the bitterest: So these hauing beene the meanes to
begger my mayster, shalbe the helpes to releeue his brothers and
sister.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ilf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom shall I now be a suter?

riche in all
things. But <font>Mum</font> , Ile say nothing, I know of two or three rich
heyres. But <font>Cargo</font> , my fiddlestick cannot play without Rozen:

<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: he</comment> merchants
of Stockfish, and not men for my market: Then vanish.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ilf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, ye old mad-cap you, what need all this? Cannot
a man ha bin a little whoore-mayster in his youth, but you must
vpbraide him with it, and tell him of his defects, which when he
is maried, his wife shall finde in him? Why my fathers dead man
now, who by his death has left me the better part of a thousand
a yeare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tut, she of Lancashire has fifteen hundred.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ilf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me haue her then, good Butler.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then shee the bright beauty of Leystershire,   
has a
thousand, nay thirteen hundred a yeare, at least.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ilf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or let me haue her, honest Butler.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Besides, she the most delicate, sweet countenanst,

most
despera~te whore-maysters, and go together by the eares for the~

excellent spoke, rare qualited, vertuous, and worthy to be

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>All.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And rich Butler?

And rich

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>All</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And wilt thou helpe vs to them Butler?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>But.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, tis to be doubted, for pretious pearle will 
hardly
be bought without pretious <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: ptetious</comment> stones, and I

since you haue deignd in this needfull portion of wedlocke to bee

Oh such am I, I ha spent all the wealth
My ancestors did purchase, made others braue
In shape and riches, and my selfe a knaue.
For tho my wealth raisd some to paint their doore,
Tis shut against me, saying I am but poore:
Nay, euen the greatest arme, whose hand hath grast,
My presence to the eye of Maiesty, shrinkes back,
His fingers cluch, and like to lead,
They are heauy to raise vp my state, being dead.

Like strumpets florish, but are foule within,
And they like Snakes, know when to cast their skin.
