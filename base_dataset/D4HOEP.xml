 <head>A 
DIALOGUE
BETWIXT
CAPTAIN <font>CRACKBRAIN</font> AND <font>TOM</font> THE <font>CHESHIRE</font> PIPER.
IN ANSWER TO
CIT AND BUMPKIN
AT A SIDE-BOARD OF A COFFEE HOUSE.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my soul, thats <font>Tom</font> the Piper that sits so
gravely there: He is a notable Knave, Ile 
acost him, pretend acquaintance, and get something
out of him; how, dost thou <font>Tom</font> ? I think there is no
body left in the house but us two, if thou wilt I'le sit
down by ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are welcome, but I declare against all
things that are not of English manufacture, let's have 
a Mug of Ale, and I'le joyn with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A match.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, may I beg the favour of your name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My name is <font>Crackbrain</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very good family; of the North or the 
West?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'me of the <font>Crackbrains</font> of the North, where 
my family has flourished some hundreds of years: But 
lets talk now of other matters, and because I hear you 
to be book learned, I'le ask you what you think of the
Dialogue twixt <font>Cit</font> and <font>Bumkin</font> ?
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it a very Scoffing Scurrilous pamphlet, 
and that the Author is within the equity of the Pillory; 
for he without any due regard to good manners, or 
truth, bespatters many of the Nobility, the most eminent 
Gentry, and Citizens with the basest and meanest practises 
of Forgery imaginable: For can any thing be more vile?
Or anything more malicious? than to do, as <font>Bumpkin</font> ,
charged himself withal, namely to fill up Sheets 
with <font>Smiths</font> , and <font>Walkers</font> , &amp;c. To amuse the 
Nation with numbers; as if they meant something further.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must take upon me the defence, and therefore 
I believe the Authour was in the right as to the
charge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, and for women to underwrite for their
Husbands in the <font>West Indies</font> too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must and will undertake his defence, because
of my alliance with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought so, for I'le be hanged if he be not of
the noble house of the <font>Crackbrains</font> too. But heark you
Captain, make good the defence of that, <font> <foreign>Et eris mihi
magnus Apollo</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le say this, that there is nothing in that Paper
thats either disloyal or Popish.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in point blank terms, but without much
difficulty reducible to either of those heads.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What the Pox, you do not take the Author for
a Papist or a Plotter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is one of the <font>Multi</font> though.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Salust</font> telling the opinion of the People about
<font>Cataline's</font> Plot, sayes, <font> <foreign>Multi ob stultitiam non putabant,
multi ob ignorantiam non videbant, multi ob pravitatem
non credebant, &amp; non credendo conjurationem 
adjuvabant</foreign> </font> : Which I have got turned thus into Meter.
<pagebreak id="3" />
Some were such Sots they did not think,
Some men so silly as to wink,
Some lewder Knave believ'd it not,
By which they did help on the Plot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crack.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess that's a very apposite 
application; but do you think then, that Author to be a Papist?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, on my Conscience, but a Protestant 
Gentleman, because he somewhere sayes so, but he might 
as well have said Protestantish, as he scurrilously sayes 
in another place, but however he is in his Religion, I 
am sure he is a Papist in faction, as many others are.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crack.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my Conscience you might as well have
charged Mr. -- so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None will be so impudent sure, as to fix any
such imputation, upon such a Pillar of the Church, such
a Steeple of Truth as he is known to be? but yet if a
man consider his further discovery of the Plot dedicated
to Dr. <font>Titus Oats</font> , his Passion for him, if he be a 
Protestant, will be very sedate, for what Jesuit could lessen
the Doctors testimony, or narrative of the Plot, more than
he has done, by saying, <font>I believe the Plot, and as much 
of it, as every good Subject ought to believe, or as any man 
in his right wits can believe, nay Ile so absolutely believe 
it, that in my Conscience you your self Doctor do not believe
more of it than I do</font> , and then very wittily                       
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wittiy</comment> , according to
his facetious way of scoffing, compares the whole thing
to the raining of <font>butter'd Turnips</font> , he might have said
<font>Cods heads</font> , it would have made up the simile every whit
as well; might not any dying Priest have said the same,
and have salved all by equivocation though he believed 
not a word of the Doctors Depositions, as, I suppose,
Mr. -- does not: Well, in fine Captain, had that 
discourse been put into Meter, it would have been the 
subject of many witty Ballads.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I vow <font>Tom</font> . you are very rude with a 
Gentleman, that bears so considerable a figure in the 
Government, as tis known he does: I professe you deserve to
be severely punished.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, he did, he may say <font> <foreign>fuimus             
Troes</foreign> </font> , he was
some body, when he had the Superintendency of your little 
Books and Ballads, which brought in many a half Crown,
before he came to that preferment, he may remember he 
was as mutinous in print as any body, because he could 
get nothing, then the Government lay under a
male-administration, when the Advocate General which should 
have tryed him for his loyalty, which he can never be
sufficiently commended for, came to be Chancellor of
<font>Norwich</font> , he was about that time very pert with the King 
too, for giving greater gifts to a Lord, that had been
of the other side, than suitable to his great mind; 
so to quiet him, it was allowed him to writ things like 
the Old <font>Diurnals</font> , twice a week, which he did for about
six years, with no small satisfaction to himself, till at
last, he stuft his papers with such little things as where
<font>Rowland Pipin</font> lived, and how Goodman <font>Shuffe</font> was
choaked with eating a two peny Custard for a wager, 
<font>&amp;c.</font> That it was not decent to the grandieur of the
Nation, to have such a publick Notary, and so the
Gazet way of writing yet continued, was taken up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is passion, but after all, prithee <font>Tom</font>   
tell
me your opinion concerning Dr. <font>Oates</font> his Depositions,
for I'm sure you'r a man of observation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have read them, and I have read some other
things, and have read him too by some small 
conversation, the measures I took from thence is, that I do take 
the Doctors Narrative to be the real truth which time 
will at last bring forth, though many are a little 
impatient about it, for he has not compass enough to invent
<comment type="compiler">IN SOURCE TEXT THIS LAST LINE OF PAGE 4 IS ERRONEOUSLY 
PLACED BEFORE THE PENULTIMATE LINE</comment>
<pagebreak id="5" />
such a lie, and so circumstantiated, for I assure you he
is no Sophister, witness his indiscretions to the 
Episcopal Clergy, and his slight speaking of them, which must 
be imputed to his education, being bred a Phanatique,
than turn'd Papist, now that's laid aside, he may be the same 
again, so I conclude him governed by truth then,
because now governed by a thing like Conscience, but had
he been a man of those intrigues, florid Parts, as the 
learned Author of <font>Cit and Bumpkin</font> , so well able to invent and 
polish a tale, with prophane swearing and other proper 
circumstances, as he has shewn himself all along to be in 
that discourse, I should have no more believ'd the Plot 
from the Doctors single testimony, than I believe the 
method of getting hands have been as he would 
insinuate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly you must give him a grain of allowance,
for he was in <font>New-Gate</font> prison before the Kings return,
and now begins to be uneasie by loss of his place, by the
freedome of trade, which has been costly enough to
some, and some other things in the world that are uneasie 
to him, which makes him very passionate at any thing 
like Fanaticism, which he takes every thing to be that 
does not absolutely <font>quadrate</font> with his own <font>capricio</font> . I
must speak truth though I be his Cozin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You put me in mind of a story when Bishop
<font>Bonner</font> came out of the <font>Marshelsea</font> , to exercise his 
Episcopal Office in Queen <font>Maries</font> time, he behaved himself
very extravagantly to some Gentlemen, that came to
wait on him in his visitation, which when one of his
Servants would have excused by his late coming out of
Prison, a Gentleman replied, he is lately come out of 
the <font>Marshelsea</font> , and now he is fit to go to <font>Bethlehem</font> , 
but there is a Friend of mine one <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: on</comment>                
<font>J. Neuton</font> , that lives on
<font>Clerken Well Green</font> , that cures all mad People, that are
<pagebreak id="6" />
not moped, as he sayes in his printed Paper, if he
would repair thither, he might be accommodated, and
this poor Nation at quiet, for his distemper is far from
any thing like mopishness, being so mercurial a 
Gentleman <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Gentlemen</comment> as he is known to be, and       
therefore as my Author says 
very curable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is no dealing with you, you are so 
bitter upon my Cozen, we'le call our old cause over again,
I'm ready to do as I said, defend that Dialogue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So you say, but heark you Captain, you may be
a man of sence for all that, do you not think it a very 
flagitious thing for a little unknown fellow, to 
comprehend all the states, orders, and divisions of men,
both Lords, Citizens, and Commons of <font>England</font> under
the opprobrious names of <font>Cit</font> and <font>Bumpkin</font> , names so
reproachful, that the meanest spirit in <font>England</font> would
make a repartee with a Cudgel in Answer to either of
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He meant only the seditious part of them, I
suppose that is them, that were for petitioning, which
was pursued with great Zeal by all sort of 
Phanatiques.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From whence you most logically conclude it
was a seditious contrivance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, marry do I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so fast good Captain, there is no Law
against it, and where no Law, no transgression yet that
shameless Author would insinuate a disposition of 
rebellion from it: Otherwayes he would not treat the 
Petitioners <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Petioners AT LINE BREAK</comment> at that         
scurrilous rate as he does all along, and
truly Captain (for I do not love to swear nor talk 
prophanely, as that Author makes his <font>Cit</font> and <font>Bumpkin</font> , do
very often,) had not his Majesty declared his dislike 
against it, as not suitable to his Royal will and pleasure,
<pagebreak id="7" />
which modest men out of good manners would not 
oppose, the Petition had been subscribed, as generally as
ever any was, for notwithstanding all his malicious
charges against it, it was not <font> <foreign>malum in se</foreign> </font> , not ill in it
self, but as it was circumstanced with the Kings will to
the contrary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what say you, to all the Phanatiques so 
cordially joyning in it, may not that beget a suspicion 
justly, that there was something intended that might be 
<font> <foreign>malum in se</foreign> </font> , ill in it self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all, doth not the Scripture tell you that
the Pharisees were great Sophisticators                              
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Sopsticators</comment> of the old Law,
confounding it by unwritten Traditions? yet they are
not blamed, neither is the doctrine of the resurrection
disparaged, for their stout assertion of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say well, then I see that a Phanatique may
sometimes be in the right, as well as the wicked 
Pharisees, or the Papists.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who doubts it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> percieve you are, though not for the defence,
of Petitioning, yet for the defence of the subject 
matter of it, what say you to the <font>twitting the King with his
Coronation Oath? that delinquents may be brought to 
punishment, and then the Parliament was to sit as long as they
pleased</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> believe it an unjust charge                  
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: chage</comment> , as to the main; for
though possibly some might be so indiscreet as to name
that Oath, not with that due respects to his Majesty, yet
I'm <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS &quot;I&quot; IN ITALICS</comment> confident none was ever so    
impudent as to demand,
in terms, the bringing delinquents to Punishment                     
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Pnnishment</comment> , being
that was so notorious a 1641 term, as must displease all men
that are not of those principles, but possibly there might
be something of trying the Lords in the Tower, which
might give the Protestantish Author occasion of that
<pagebreak id="8" />
flourish, as if their Case was paralel to those worthy
Lords and Gentlemen, then called Delinquents, than
which nothing can be more vilely insinuated, but 
as to his last charge, that the Parliament was to sit as 
long as they pleased, I'm sure it is so notoriously false, as 
nothing but a man of a bold front could have said it, I
wish he had been in <font>Scotland</font> , and a Subject to their Laws, 
when he said it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee why so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They have a Law there, as I have been 
informed, called the Statute of <font>Leasing</font> , that if any man by
prepense false suggestion or insinuation accuse a Lord,
so as he may be capitally questioned, it is capital in the
Accuser; if that Law was on force here, my little Fellow
would be collered; for can any thing be more 
malitious, than to accuse a Body of Men of attempting a 
thing which cannot be acted without the greatest 
treason imaginable, as that of perpetuating a Parliament, 
for that's the English of sitting as long as they please, 
meant by the ingenious Authour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He but tells you that a Country Justice said so
somewhere upon the Bench, and so they are not his
his <comment type="compiler">SO IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Writer of Dramatique or Dialogue is to 
answer alwayes for what he makes the Persons speak, which
might be the occasion of that Statute for the punishment
of prophane Swearing by Players of interludes, which
our Author is not free from, it may be that quality made
him nameless, for fear some cross grain'd Cur of the
Bench should have levyed the twelve pence's upon him.
But this must be wholly an Artifice to blacken the 
Petition, for no Justice in the Country, nor <font>Westminister</font> 
neither, though many of them, are far from Conjurers
could ever be so fond to assert a thing, so wholly and
<pagebreak id="9" />
in every parcel an untruth: but there may be strange 
children now, as there were in <font>Davids</font> time, whose
mouth speaketh vanity, from whom the Prophet prayed
deliverance, <font>Psal.</font> 144. <font>v.</font> II.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why you are a strange man, to expect literal truths
from a man that writes in my Friends mystical way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heark you Captain, if your Friend in his 
mystical way had abused me in particular, as he has almost
the whole Nation in general, I would in down-right
terms have broken his head, whensoever I had met
him, and in the mean time have cudgelled you, noble
Captain, till you had discovered his name, though I be
but a Piper, call me <font>Bumkin</font> ? I would have
him know, and you too, that I'm the 22th Piper of my
Family, licensed by the Heirs of <font>Dutton</font> , now Lord 
<font>Gerard</font> , a Faculty saved to that Family by two Acts of 
Parliament; so we are no Rogues, like your South 
Country Fidlers, Captain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are very hot, cooler language would do
as well, for hot words do no business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, well; but what say you to that 
detracting passage, that it would be never the worse,
if they, <font>viz.</font> the men of Estates, <font>were out of 
favour at Court; for an honest revenge, ye know, goes a 
great way with a tender Conscience</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can any thing be more base than this, to
desire that the men of Estates should be out of favour
at Court, because it would prompt them to revenge, 
as he very Christianly insinuates, the consequence of
which must be a War, as he must hope: but I wonder
he should, when he is a man of known modesty before
an Enemy, if he be the man I guess; but he is a publick
spirited man, and so hopes a War as the only expedient
<pagebreak id="10" />
to set aside all Petitioning for the future: for to say
truth, there will be nothing left upon such success as
he proposes to petition for; but if there be no better
conduct than his, there may be a mistake in measures:
our last War was occasioned from such rascally 
Politiques, to press both sides to extremities, and foment
all differences into the bargain too, as I have been told;
but I hope to see a thousand such raskally Pickthanks
hanged, before any thing of that happen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But is not my Cosin very witty, when he says
it is a blessing to have neither Friend, nor Money, and
yet to design to be taken prisoner, as the way to both,
and makes it out very prettily?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes faith he is, but why the pox doth he not
pursue his own methods to preferment, take a
Goal, for on my Conscience he cannot crack of
either; for how he should have Friends that hath 
abused the whole Nation I see not, neither how he should
abound in Money; for Lands he has none, I 
believe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you think <font>Tom</font> a Goal is the fittest place  
for my Cosin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Aye truly do I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But do you not like his brave description of
the benefits of a Prison, and the Rogueries of those
that ply there to that purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly like the rest, for from the converse of
<font>Newgate-birds</font> <comment type="compiler">birds NOT ITALICISED IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> , he       
concludes all the Intrigues of the 
World to be managed at the same Religious Rule, and
then makes his <font>Cit.</font> an Officer of Address, as one may
call him; but he keeps his Office no where that I can
find out but in your Cosin <font>Crackbrains</font> Noddle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what think you of the discovery of a new
Plot, in case the Petition had gone on? of five 
<pagebreak id="11" />
Petitions more, if the Parliament had met; one against the
Lords in the <font>Tower</font> , another for the sitting of the
Parliament till they had gone through with what they had
to do, a third for taking away Bishops Votes, a fourth
for the remove of Evil Councellors, a fifth for putting
the <font>Militia</font> into safe hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Cosin might do well to produce the
draught of such Petitions, or at least name some-body
besides his <font>Bumkin</font> that had seen some such thing, 
otherways he is to be taken for a Make-bate, and a Lyar;
and truly we have reason to acquiesce under the 
Government of our gracious Prince, that cannot be 
provoked by such sycophantly Knaves to do any thing but 
what becomes him: But your Cosin shews himself a
good man upon all occasions, by ranging all those 
Petitions together, as if to Petition for the Tryal of the
Lords was equally criminal with the rest, can any thing
more reflect upon the Honour of the King, Parliament,
and whole Nation, than to insinuate, which must be a
necessary consequence of so marshalling the Petitions,
that a Petition against the Lords, impeached by 
Parliament for High-Treason, when a Court is in being that
can only take Cognizance of their Affairs, is to be 
ranked amongst Misdemeanours of the highest nature; if
this do not proceed from a design which I think is not
very Protestantish of running the Plot into <font>Sham</font> , I am
mistaken. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But heark you, Minstrel, does not my Cosin go
on bravely, when he tells us what dangerous
Rogues the Citizens are, and what designs they
have still on foot, to distract, if not subvert the 
Government, by contriving new methods of Petitioning,
and telling us, that those <font>Heads will find hands if there
should be occasion</font> ? On my Conscience he is a notable 
man.
<pagebreak id="12" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So he is, and a bold one too, I think, to asperse
by intimation so considerable a body of men, as the
City of <font>London</font> , with contrivances against the 
Government, only to shew his Wit, without the least ground
imaginable as I can see: I tell you, if it was in <font>France</font> ,
as fond as he is of that Government, they would anger
him, for he would without doubt be put to the 
question, that a discovery might be made of such grand 
designs in agitation; and if it proved all a Staff of his
own, as I dare swear this is, then I believe he would be
broke upon the Wheel, for endeavouring to bring the
King into a jealousie of his good City of <font>Paris</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But is not my Cosin an excellent Casuist, by
running his divisions upon Conscience?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, in his scoffing way; but I must tell both
him and you, in answer to his frequent running that
expression, <font>Of the people of the Lord into ridicule</font> ;
though I am as far from believing that those pretenders
are such, yet God hath a people that he will vindicate
one day, to the confusion of faces of all them <font>that sit 
in the seat of the scornful</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But has he not mauld the <font>Predestinarians</font> with
their Doctrine of Necessity?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is too shallow for that; he hath a little
droll'd upon the consequence of the Opinion: but I
tell you Capt. what <font>I</font> heard a <font>Blacksmith</font> over a Pot of
Ale say the other day, that every futurity, or thing to
come, was certain in it self, whether it should happen 
or not, and that cannot be denied Captain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It cannot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If so, what room then for free Agency, when
its impossible to remove a certainty: But as <font>I</font> heard a
Divine say once, no created understanding can 
comprehend the difference betwixt Gods certain foresight
<pagebreak id="13" />
and predestinating, so <font>I</font> leave it; and <font>I</font> am sure he would
not have medled with it, but that he could fix 
something of reproach upon the party, from the 
consequences of it, meeting with some bad practices of 
hypocritical men; but yet as generally as it is now 
decryed, it hath been otherway; for they that know any
thing, know that most of the Bishops, and generally
the inferiour Clergy were of that Opinion, and yet 
very holy and pious men in their Generations, for all
his scoffs that he fixes upon that Opinion by inference,
for none was ever yet so impudent to assert in terms
what he makes his <font>Cit</font> to do, and truly I do believe
he is of the <font>Cits</font> Opinion, that a thing may be sin in
one which is not in another; for lying, though
it be sin in most men, is not so in him as he
thinks, he otherways would not have so much 
used it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you <font>Tom Piper</font> to be such a

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Mother was a Parsons Daughter, had little
to her Portion but a few Books and Sermon Notes of
her Fathers, which I used to read at spare times to the
Neighbourhood, and so became thus skilful.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, what think you of his clawing the
Rogues off for their old Rebellion, is't not manly and
brave?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a thing that has been said a thousand times
when it was so, but now it looks like breaking the Act
of Oblivion, a thing that his Majesty, to his Immortal
Honour, holds sacred; such a little Rat as he methinks
should not be nibling, when the Lyon is unconcerned.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Cit</font> and <font>Bumkin</font> drunk, and why may not

<pagebreak id="14" />
it not an excellent facetious discourse, displaying 
Villany in its proper colours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is rather a teaching people how to be 
Villains; like your fashionable Plays, teach more sins than
they reprove. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Cosin cannot I see get your good word,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As how?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'l Pipe at his Wifes next Churching, and
then I'm sure the half Ginney and the Frumenty will
please you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let it alone till then; but in the mean time I'le
give a short account of my sentiments of those ten
Pages. <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS FIRST LETTER OF I'le IN ITALICS.</comment> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let's have it then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He begins with comparing <font>Presbyterians</font> and
<font>Jesuites</font> , a thing now that is <font>trite</font> and thredbare; there
is a Book called <font>Lysimachus Nicanor</font> that has done it
more to the purpose, writ nigh forty years agone, but
yet in his rails upon the later, he speaks ironically of
the Plot, (when he calls the Jesuites the <font>Heads of it upon
the King, &amp;c.</font> ) as a man must needs conclude that reads
the whole discourse, especially if that Author had any
intelligence or correspondence with the Author of the
further discovery dedicated to Dr. <font>Titus Oates</font> ; and
that flourish might have been as decently saved, besides
his Pen too much resembles a Clever, cuts only one way,
as a man may easily observe, by his constant pinching 
upon that party for the 1641. business, a thing that none of
them has the face now publickly to justifie, and his 
passing by the Rebellion in <font>Ireland</font> , accompanied with the
murder of nigh a million of Protestants, without the
least reflection, though that Villany be yet justified, or
at least not owned to be so by that Party, as it was at
<pagebreak id="15" />
first abetted by the Pope; and then after all, as if he
would make himself compleatly wicked, he scandalizes
the Protestant Religion, which the late King of blessed
memory own'd that he fought for, as may be seen yet
by his Declarations, and the inscription upon his Coyns,
stampt at the beginning of the late Rebellion; for by
that is meant, as he makes his Citizen say, the Religion
of the dissenters from the Church; a distinction that
the late blessed Martyr would not have thankt him for.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive you are very poynant upon my 
Friend still, but go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he goes on with teaching a method of
Villany which he would call discovering, to inflame the
Nation, and widen the breaches betwixt the King and
his People; for why else should he, amongst other
things, lay such a stress upon the Kings being one of
the three Estates, and make such damn'd inferences, a
thing decried by all sober men, because declared 
otherwise in the Preambles of several acts of Parliament, and
yet the good King in a Message to the two Houses 
owned three Estates, when the Bishops were by Act 
removed, of which by consequence he must be one, but that 
may be lookt upon, considering the novelty of that 
disposition to be a lapse in the Secretary, and so no weight
to be laid upon it. I refer you to the Declaration 
bearing date from <font>York</font> , <font>June</font> 13. 1642. Then he falls upon
the light and foolish antick gestures of the 
Conventiclers, with their fond metaphers not worth answering,
because none so foolish as to adjust them, then he goes
on, as if the Plot was onely a blind to enrage people,
and that there was a real design to destroy the 
Hierarchy, and all the Sons of the Church, by the name of the
Papists in Masquerade, and get all the places of profit
to themselves.
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not that very well hinted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What are you a hinter, and a holder forth? so
its well hinted of buzzing into the peoples ears to 
dispose them to Rebellion, of the Emperour of <font>Morocco's</font>
landing upon <font>Salisbury-Plain</font> 35000 light Horse men,
and a great many other Fopperies, not worth taking
notice on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To say truth, there are a great many little
things in it, but there must be something to fill up, or
else it would not come to account, it would not 
advance from the Stationer any thing considerable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But he should have studied propriety of things
to have made 'em pass the better: Is it not, think you,
a well laid thing, to make his <font>Bumkin</font> whom he 
represents, a cunning, projecting, canting Knave? to bring 
in a story by the head and shoulders of <font>Moses</font> , and the
ten Tables, and correcting himself with a thundering
Oath, one that he afterward makes justifying the three
Estates, and other intrigues of Politiques, it might have
passed, had he laid the Scene amongst his friends in
<font>Flanders</font> ; and then saying that he had read in a Book
that the Bishops in <font>H.</font> Eighths time made the ten 
Commandments, and make foolish inferences from thence
too: The whole thing is a lye, for no man ever yet read
any such thing in a Book, but in his scurrilous Pamphlet;
the nearest to it is, what Bishop <font>Spotswood</font> reports of the
Priests in <font>Scotland</font> about that time, that they would
have made the common people believe, the more to 
incense them against <font>Patrick Hamilton</font> , and the Gospellers
of that Age, that <font>Martin Luther</font> and his Complices made
the New Testament, or at least S. <font>Pauls</font> Epistles, but
<font>touch not mine Anointed</font> : I hope the ingenious Author
is too wise to make reflections of that nature.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come Gentlemen you have been
in eager discourse, but I did hear the subject matter of it
very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was only making some passionate observations
upon a Book twice or thrice printed, called <font>Cit</font> and 
<font>Bumkin</font> , which he undertook wholly, and in every part to
defend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What you <font>Captain Crackfart</font> turn'd
Advocate? must <font>Cicero pro Milone</font> be reacted by you
with a horse pox to your Captainship? How long is it
since I releived you, and a thin starved thing yclipped
your Boy, with ten penyworth of Pudding pies, when
you and he had lived three dayes upon stewed 
fiddlestrings? I tell thee <font>Tom Piper</font> , how this fellow came by
the doughty name of Captain, he was a foot Souldier in
<font>Olivers</font> time, and upon a march stole a live Pike in an 
Inn, out of a Pale, and put it into his Breeches, because
<pagebreak id="18" />
he saw his Comrade had done the like to a Barbel, but
presently his manful roars made a discovery, so he was
cashiered, pretended it was for his loyalty, and from
that time dubb'd himself Captain: But as to the 
discourse, I tell thee Old Souldier, that if he, or thou, or
any body that wears a head, God bless the King, should
have call'd, or shall call me by the contemptible name of
<font>Cit</font> (though I be but free of the Porters Company) I
would and will, if ever it be any mans ill luck so to do,
all to be pudding-pie his Calves-head: What <font>Cit</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How I am now like to be worried betwixt these
two learned men? <font>Tom Piper</font> and <font>Make a noise Tom</font> the
Pudding Wright: Well, well, but though you quarrel,
my friend, for his names of <font>Cit</font> and <font>Bumkin</font> , yet Mr 
<font>Truman</font> speaks very heavenly by the same Authors 
directions: speak against that if you dare, the best of you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr <font>Truman</font> speaks truly of the       
Papists,
but not all that a true Son of the Church might have
said, he sayes in answer to the Charge, that the Papists
loyalty was in their own defence, being in a manner 
necessitated to that side, that it was better, if so, than 
fighting against the King, and further that no man drew his
sword in the opposite cause, <font>but known Separatists</font> , and
<font>that not one Separatist struck in the Kings quarrel</font> , he might
have added, if he had thought fit, that after the King
was outed, not one Papist ever entered into a Plot for
his Restitution, but the whole truth was not his business,
whereas the Schismaticks, as he boldly enough calls some
sort of men, asserted the Kings Cause in the lowest Ebb:
and that so bravely both by outward force, and other
less visible endeavours, that the Kings Restitution must
be ascribed to them, as to the second cause, which made
some amends for their former deviation, I tell thee 
<font>Crackbrain</font> , had the King had no better friends than the Papists,
<pagebreak id="19" />
he had never seen the English shore again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But have you read on?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and find the business about the     
three
Estates repeated over again to no purpose, wherein the 
learned Author has with great reputation to himself 
proved the Snow white.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what think you of his bringing in <font>Le
Strange's</font> Epistle to the History of the Plot: is not that a 
heeler?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Like the rest, for I have not much to
say about that Gentleman, either <font>pro</font> or <font>con</font> , for they say
he is a very pretty man at small matters, but those two
Authors do most harmoniously agree in driving on, 
and fixing a worse Plot upon the Non-Conformists,
which they both are careful to improve, which is by
their favour a setting up of the worship of false Gods,
to lessen, if not to destroy the worship of the true one,
so whilst they would alarm the Nation with this 
Chymera of a Plot to be found no where, but in their 
learned Brains, the true Plot will weather off, or which is
worse, go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you are as hard to please as                
<font>Tom Piper</font> , I
had thought you had revered Mr. <font>Strange</font> at another
rate, than to speak so indifferently of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indifferently do you call it? I 
wonder that I, or any other good Subject should do so, 
especially when it is considered who licensed <font>Humane 
Reason</font> , that Book, that deserved to be burnt by the common 
Hangman, as a great Lord said some bodies else did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did not he say then in excuse that he would
license an answer to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be so but that resolves into
this, that he would license any thing for the Fees of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le tell him what you say, and then i' faith he'l
<pagebreak id="20" />
maul you in a Ballad, <font>with nows the time</font> as well as he hath
done somebody else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom Piper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Gentlemen not so fast, fair and softly
goes far on a day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But do you hear <font>Make a noise Tom</font> , how do you
like Mr.<font>Trumans</font> description of the duty of Subjects, and
Kings?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall tell you my mind as to that too,
for I have read the Book o're; and we Pie men are old
Dog at Politiques in this communicative age: Well, now
as to that, by multitude of questions, he perplexes the
Cause, for if he layd down for his position this truth,
<font>That in no Cases whatsoever it can be lawful for a Subject
to arm against his Prince</font> , there had been then no Room
for a shift, but he makes his <font>Cit</font> ask a knavish question,
<font>What if a King will transgress all the Laws of God and man?
may not the People resume their trust</font> ? The answer is in 
the negative, but a man might have shap'd another 
answer as pertinent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As how?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Make a noise T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When God gives over Kings to be
wholly led by their sensual appetites, and to lay aside
all manner of Justice, he often suffers the People to be
so too, for the world is rather governed by example than
Precept. There are many sad examples of that kind, as of
<font>Don Pedro</font> the cruel of <font>Castile</font> stabb'd to death by his 
Bastard Brother. <font>Winceslaus</font> King of <font>Bohemia</font> , once 
imprisoned, and when he had by miracle recovered his Estate,
grew so barbarously cruel to all ranks of men, that the
Citizens of <font>Prague</font> rose as one man against him, upon
which news, being in the Castle, he fell into a fit of an
Apoplexy, and died suddenly. <font>Christiern</font> the second of
<font>Denmark</font> , who was deposed by his Unkle <font>Frederick</font> .
And of later years Sultan <font>Ibrahim</font> the Great Turk, who
<pagebreak id="21" />
was for his outragious lusts and other extravagancies,
deposed and strangled in the <font>Seraglio</font> . There is a living
example of that kind, <font>Sebastian</font> of <font>Portugal</font> , set aside and
imprisoned by his Brother, who now injoys as the reward
of his fact both his Brothers wife and Kingdom, and yet
not so much as a Sword, or Pen manag'd in his behalf;
by these examples, though it cannot be denied, but it
is the Subjects duty to suffer patiently, and like the 
<font>Theban</font> Legion, suffer themselves to be cut in pieces, 
rather than to resist, as Mr. <font>Truman</font> well observed, yet 
nature in those Cases is often so strong, that there is no 
trusting to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive then, that your opinion is, that it is
safer for Princes to keep within due moderation, as to
their administration, than to do otherwise, 
notwithstanding they have so much right on their sides, even as to
this world; for if a Nation should lie under such 
unhappy circumstances, as to have the Prince and People at
difference, the Divines of the Popular, as well as the 
other, would from Texts of Scripture, whether 
misapplied or no, not material offer <font>Pillows</font> to both Parties, as 
is
well observed in an excellent Passage out of <font>Denhams
Sophy</font> , <font>Page</font> 44.
