 <head>THE STAGE-PLAYERS COMPLAINT.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Cane.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Stay <font>Reed</font> ? Whither away so speedily? What
you goe, as if you meant to leape over the Moon
now? What's the matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Reede.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The matter is plain enough: You incuse me
of my nimble feet; but I thinke your tongue runnes a
little faster, and you contend as much to out-strip
facetious <font>Mercury</font> in your tongue, as lame <font>Vulcan</font> in
my feete.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quicke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Me thinks you're very eloquent: Prithee tell
me, Don't <font>Suada</font> , and the Jove-begotten-braine
<font>Minerva</font> lodge in your facundious tongue: You have
without doubt some great cause of alacrity, that you
produce such eloquent speeches now. Prithee what is't?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? Cause of alacrity? S'foot I had never
more cause of sorrow in my life: And dost thou tell
me of that? Fie, fie!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee why? I did but conjecture out of
your sweet words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well! I see you'le never be hanged for a
Conjurer. Is this a world to be merry in? Is this an 
age to rejoyce in? Where one may as soone find 
honesty in a Lawyers house, as the least cause of mirth in 
the world. Nea you know this well enough, but 
onely you love to be inquisitive, and to search the 
Nature of men.
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say true indeed: J cann't deny but that 
the world doe swell with griefe-bedaubing cares. For 
illustrate the whole Universe, from <font>Aurora's</font> purple 
doores, to the Occidentall West, and you shall finde
all things drowned in the floods of sorrow. And no 
marvaile too: For here Gods heavy hand doth punish, 
there man's oppression doe raigne: And what greater 
affiction can be expected, then that both of God and 
Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis true: And now a dayes 'tis very
difficult to live without one of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Revolve all humane nature: Here you may 
see a man puff't up with the winde of popular
applause, climing to the top of Honour, but being once 
touch't with the breath of Iustice, oh in what a
moment doth he tumble downe. There you may see one 
oppressed with the tyranny of disgrace, and groaning 
vnder the burden of calamity, but being smil'd upon 
by Justice, oh how suddainly is he mounted up with 
the wings of Fame. There you may perceive women 
lamenting the deaths of their poore Husbands; here 
one deploring the Churches Anarchie: there one 
grieving at Fortunes malignity: so that in the whole 
world such diverse streames of sorrow doe flow every 
where: that if they should meet: they would easily 
make up an Ocean.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speake of the Epidemicall cause, that 
produceth universall griefe, but you shall not need, 
for we our selves have cause enough to mourne for
our owne mis-fortune, and not to participate with
the griefe of the whole world.
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Well! wee must submit our selves to Gods
all-disposing providence, who in his owne time will
give a period to our irregular teares. But our cause of
sorrow, is the cause of the whole world: For i'me 
perswaded that there's never a <font>What lack you Sir</font> in all 
the City, but is sensible of our calamity too, although 
we seeme to them to beare the greatest burthen
thereof,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beleeve thee: therefore I thinke, they
may well commisserate our cause with their own, and
not account us so ridiculous to the vulgar spectacle of 
the world. For when we rejoyce, they doe all rejoyce 
with us; but when wee lament, they have all cause 
to lament too: wherefore let not that thing trouble 
you so much.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, come, let us omit this patheticall
passion, and thinke on the brave times which wee have
had heretofore: Oh, the times, when wee have
vapoured in the streets like Courtiers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A pritty comparison! like Courtiers
indeed; for I thinke our pockets were as empty as the
proudest of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh the times, when my tongue have ranne
as fast upon the Scaeane, as a <font>Windebankes</font> pen over
the Ocean.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh the times, when my heeles have
capoured over the Stage as light as a <font>Finches</font>
Feather.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But (alas) we must looke for no more of
these times I feare.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so? Dost thou thinke because a cloud 
sometimes may cover and obnubilate the Sun, that it 
will therefore shine no more? Yes I'le warrant you, 
and that more bright too: so never feare Boy, but we 
shall get the day agen for all this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But i'le assure you 'tis to be feared: For 
Monopolers are downe, Projectors are downe, the High 
Commission Court is downe, the Starre-chamber is
down, &amp; (some think) Bishops will downe: and why 
should we then that are farre inferior to any of those 
not justly feare least we should be downe too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pish, I can show thee many infallible reasons 
to the contrary: we are very necessary and
commodious to all people: First for strangers, who can desire 
no better recreation, then to come and see a Play: then, 
for Citizens, to feast their wits: then for Gallants, who 
otherwise perhaps would spend their money in 
drunkennesse, and lasciviousnesse doe find a great delight 
and delectation to see a Play: then for the learned, it
does increase and adde wit, constructively to wit: then, 
for Gentlewomen, it teacheth them how to deceive 
idlenesse: then for the ignorant, it doe's augment their 
knowledge, Pish, a thousand more Arguments I could 
adde, but that I should weary your patience too much: 
Well! in a word we are so needfull for the Common 
good, that in some respect it were almost a sinne to 
put us downe: therefore let not these frivolous things 
perplex your vexatious thoughts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But it makes me feare i'le assure you in these 
times: And I thinke it would be a very good plot to 
borrow good store of money and then runne away: 
what thinke you of it?
<pagebreak id="5" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A good plot, quother? So you may come to lie 
in a worser plot for it all the dayes of your life. S'foot 
runne away too? So you may be taken for a young 
<font>Suckling</font> , and then followed presently with a hundred 
Horse. Fie, fie, remit these fopperies, you little thinke 
of the last Comedy you acted now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The last Comedy quother? I act Tragedies 
every day, but I cannot remember since I acted a 
Comedy, 'tis so long agoe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But Prithee how comes it to passe that you 
act Tragedies every day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? J'le tell thee: my purse each day 
perisheth most Tragaedically: and now J may be taken 
for a Scholler, since J've no money, but because I 
cannot speake true Latine, I'me afraid, I shall be 
taken for a Lawyer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do's Lawyers then speake false Latin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As if you know not that! Why? True 
Latine is as much out of fashion at <font>Innes of Court</font> , as 
good cloathes at <font>Cambridge</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, come remit your jests, and thinke on
our present estates now: and you know the Sicknesse 
is dangerous, and increaseth weekly; therefore I think 
we must be content in the meane while to live like 
<font>Diogenes</font> in his Tub.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well! the best remedy that J can imagine 
for our present Calamitie, is to downe on our knees 
humbly, and pray God to abate the Sicknesse, and 
let each true hearted Subject conjoyne with us in our 
supplication.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This motion pleaseth mee exceedingly,
come let us goe to some other friends, and unitely
joyne in our Prayers.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A match, come let us performe it with
expedition: and in the meane while let us conclude
with part of our Letany.
   <font>From Plague, Pestilence, and Famine, from
Battell, Murder, and suddaine Death:</font>
   Good Lord deliver us.
