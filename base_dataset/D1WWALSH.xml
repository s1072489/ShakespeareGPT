   <nonSpeech>Sixtlye, he being demaunded

aunswered and denied vtterlye that he had
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
none about hym, neyther in anye other
place of his worlde, eyther aboue the
ground, or vnder the ground, either in
any place secrete or open.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Seuenthly, he being demau~ded how
he knoweth when anye man is
bewytched: He sayth that he knew it partlye
by the Feries, and saith that ther be. iii. 
kindes of Feries white, greene, &amp; black.
Which when he is disposed to vse, hee
speaketh with them vpon hyls, where
as there is great heapes of earth, as
namely in Dorsetshiere. And betwene
the houres of. xii. and one at noone, or
at midnight he vseth them. Whereof (he
sayth) the blacke Feries be the woorst.
Also he saith that he had a booke of hys
said maister, which had great circles in
it. wherein he would set two waxe
candels a crosse of virgin waxe, to raise the
familiar spirite. Of whom he woulde
then aske for any thing stollen, who dyd
it, and where the thing stollen was left,
and thereby did know, and also by the
Feries he knoweth who be bewitched.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
   <nonSpeech>Eightly, he being demaunded
whether he had euer any Familiar or no: he
sayth that he had one of his sayde
mayster. Which Familiar (after his booke of
Circles was taken from him by one
Robert Baber of Crokehorne, then beyng
Constable, in the yeare. 1565) he coulde
neuer do any thing touching his
Familiar, nor the vse thereof, but hys
Familiar dyd then depart from him, and wyll
neuer come to him agayne, as he sayth.
And further he sayth vpon his oth, that
his Familiar would somtyme come
vnto hym lyke a gray blackish Culuer, and 
somtime lyke a brended Dog, and
somtimes lyke a man in all proportions,
sauing that he had clouen feete.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Ninthly, he being demaunded howe
long he had the vse of the Familiar: He
sayd one yeare by his sayd maisters life,
and. iiii. yeres after his death. And whe~
he would call him for a horse stollen, or
for any other matter wherein he would
vse him: hee sayth hee must geue hym
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
some lyuing thing, as a Chicken, a Cat,
or a Dog. And further he sayth he must
geue hym twoo lyuing thynges once a
yeare. And at the first time when he had
the Spirite, hys sayd maister did cause
him to deliuer him one drop of his blud,
whych bloud the Sprite did take away
vpon hys paw.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Tenthly, he sayth that when the
Familiar should doo any thing at his
commaundement, in going anye arrant: he
would not go, except fyrst two wax
candels of Virgin waxe shoulde first haue
bene layd a crosse vpon the Circle, wyth
a little Frankensence, and saynt Iohns
woorte, and once lighted, and so put out
agayne: which Frankensence must be
layd then at euery end of the candel, as
he saith a crosse, and also a litle
Frankensence with saynt Iohns woort burned
vpon the grounde, or euer the Familiar
would go, and that would force hym to
go the message, and returne agayne at
the houre appoynted.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
   <nonSpeech>Eleuenthly, he being asked whether
they y=t= do good to such as ar bewitched,
cannot also do hurt if they list. Whereto
he answered, he that doth hurt, can
neuer heale againe any man, nor can at
any time do good. Howbeit he saith that
he whych hath but the gyft of healyng,
may do hurt if he list, but his gift of
healyng can neuer returne agayne to anye
other persons vse.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Twelftly, he being demaunded
whether that any of the three kindes of
Feiries, when they did hurt, dyd it of theyr
own malignity, or of the prouocation of
anye wicked man? He aunswered that
they doo hurt of their owne malignitie,
and not prouoked by anye manne, and
that thei haue power vpon no man, but
vpon suche as onelye doo want fayth,
which is y=e= cause why they haue power
more of some persons, then of anye
others. Furthermore, he being
demaunded to what end the Familiar dyd serue
them? He aunswered that hee serueth
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
for no purpose, but to search out things
theft stolle~, &amp; for no other purpose at al.
He being further demaunded to what 
end y=e= Spirits, in the likenes of Todes
and the pictures of man or woma~ made
in wax or clay, doo serue? He sayde, that
Pictures made in wax, wyll cause the
partye (for whom it is made) to
continue sycke twoo whole yeares: because
it will be two whole yeares ere the wax
wyll be consumed. And as for the
Pictures of claye, their confection is after
this maner. They vse to take the earth
of a new made graue, the ryb bone of a
man or woman burned to ashes, if it be
for a woman, they take the bone of a
woman, if for a man, the bone of a man,
and a blacke Spider, with an inner pith
of an elder, tempered all in water, in the
which water the sayd Todes must fyrst
be washed. And after al ceremonies
ended, they put a pricke, that is, a pyn or a
thorne in any member wher they wold
haue the party greued. And if the sayde
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
pricke be put to the hart, the party dieth
within nine daies. Which Image they
burne in the moste moystest place they
can finde. And as touching the vsing of
the Todes, the which he sayth haue
seueral names: som they cal great
Browning, or little Brownyng, or Bonne,
great Tom Twite, or litle To~ Twite,
with other like names: Which Todes
being called, the Witches strike with. ii.
withie sperres on both sydes of y=e= head,
and saith to the Spirit their Pater
noster backward, beginning at the ende of
the Pater noster, but they wyll neuer
say their Creede. And when he is
stricken, they commaunde the Tode to hurt
such a man or woma~ as he would haue
hurted. Whereto if he swell, he will goo
wher he is apointed, either to the deiry,
brewhouse, or to the dry kill of malt, or
to the Cattel in the field, to the stable,
to the shepefold, or to any other like
places, and so returne agayne to his place.
The bodies of men or women bee hurt
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
by the Images before named, &amp; mens
goods &amp; Cattels be hurt by the Todes,
in commaunding and vsing them, as
aforesaid, as he sayth. And if the Tode
called forth, as afore said, do not swell,
then will the Witch that vseth them cal
forth an other to do the act, which if hee
do not, then will they spy an other tyme
when they maye cause the partye to be
found lacking fayth, or els to bee more
voide of grace, where he or they may be
hurt. Furthermore he saith, that who so
doth once a day saye the Lordes prayer
and his Creede in perfite charitie, the
Witch shall haue no power on hys body
or goodes for that day.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Xiii. He beyng demaunded whether
that those which doo heale men or
women, being hurted by Witches, can find
out of those Images vnder ground, wher
with they were tormented? He
affyrmeth they can</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And. xiiii. he being demaunded
whether he himselfe eyther hath or had at
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
any time any such Tode, or that euer he
made anye suche Images to hurt man,
woman, or childe? He affirmeth by the
othe which he hath taken, that he neuer
had such Todes, or euer made suche
Images.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And. xv. he being demaunded,
whether that euer he dyd anye hurt to man,
woman, or childe, or to their goodes
or Cattels? He sayth by the othe
that he hath taken, that he
neuer did any such hurt
either in body or
goodes.</nonSpeech>
