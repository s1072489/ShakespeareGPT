   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I beg leave that a poor ignorant Man, that is so      
heavily
charged, that it seems a little unequal to consider the reason, why  
a 
Prisoner, in such a case as this is, is not allowed Counsel; but your
Lordship is supposed to be Counsel for him. But I think it very hard
I cannot be admitted Counsel; and I humbly hope your Lordship will
not suffer me to be lost by things that my self cannot answer. I deny
the Conclusion, but the Premisses are too strong and artificial.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You cannot deny the Premisses, but that you 
have
done these things; but you deny the Conclusion that you are a
Traitor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I can safely and honestly.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You would make a better Secretary of State, 
than a 
Logician; for they never deny the Conclusion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I grant it your Lordship: You see the advantage great 
men
have of me, that do not pretend to Logick.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The labour lies upon their hands; the Proof
belongs to them to make out these Intrigues of yours; therefore
you need not have Counsel, because the Proof must be plain
upon you, and then it will be in vain to deny the Conclusion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I hope (my Lord) if there be any Point of Law, that I 
am not
skill'd in, that your Lordship will be pleased not to take the
advantage over me. Another thing seems most dreadful, that is, the   
violent
prejudices that seem to be against every man in</font> England, <font>that is
confess'd to be a Roman Catholick</font> . <font>It is possible that a Roman
Catholick may be very innocent of these crimes. If one of those
Innocent Roman Catholicks should come to this Bar, he lies under such
disadvantages already, and his Prejudices so greatly byasseth humane
Nature, that unless your Lordship will lean extremely much on
the other side, Justice will hardly stand upright, and lie upon a
Level. But to satisfie your Lordship, I do not think it any service   
to
destroy any of the Kings Subjects, unless it be in a very plain      
case.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You need not make any preparations for us   
in this
matter, you shall have a fair, just, and legal Trial; if
Condemned, it will be apparent you ought to be so; and without a fair
Proof, there shall be no Condemnation. Therefore you shall
find, we will not do to you, as you do to us, blow up at
adventure, kill people because they are not of your perswasion; our
Religion teacheth us another Doctrine, and you shall find it
clearly to your advantage. We seek no mans blood, but our
<pagebreak id="16" />
own safety. But you are brought here from the necessity of
things, which your selves have made; and from your own
actions you shall be condemned, or acquitted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>It is supposed upon Evidence, that the Examinations   
that
have been of me in Prison, are like to be Evidence against me now; I
have nothing to say against it: But give me leave to say at this
time, that when I was in Prison, I was upon my ingenuity charged;
I promised I would confess all I knew. And I onely say this, That    
what
I said in Prison is true, and am ready at any time to Swear and
Evidence, that that is all the truth.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is all true that you say: but did you    
tell all that
vvas true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I know no more, than what I declared to the Two       
Houses.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , I'll tell you when you    
will be apt to
gain credit in this matter: You say, that you told all things that
you knew, the Truth, and the whole Truth. Can Mankind be
persuaded, that you, that had this Negotiation in 74. and 75. left
off just then, at that time vvhen your Letters vvere found
according to their Dates? Do you believe, there vvas no Negotiation
after 75. because vve have not found them? Have you spoke
one vvord to that? Have you confessed, or produced those
Papers and Weekly Intelligence? When you ansvver that, you
may have credit; vvithout that, it is impossible: For I cannot
give credit to one vvord you say, unless you give an account of
the subsequent Negotiation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pris.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>After that time (as I said to the House of Commons) I 
did
give over Corresponding. I did offer to take all Oaths and Tests in
the World, that I never had one Letter for at least two years; yea,
(that I may keep my self within compass) I think it was for three or
four. Now I have acknowledged to the House of Commons, I have had
a cursory Correspondence, which I never regarded or valued; but
as the Letters came, I burnt them, or made use of them as common
Paper. I say, that for the general Correspondence I have had for two
or three years, they have had every one of them Letters, that I know  
of.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attor. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether you had or no, you shall have the   
fairest
Trial that can be. And we cannot blame the Gentleman, for he
is more used to greater Affairs, than these Matters or Forms of
Lavv. But (my Lord) I desire to go unto Evidence, and vvhen
that is done, he shall be heard, as long as he pleaseth, vvithout
any interruption. If he desire it, before I give my Evidence, let
him have Pen, Ink, and Paper (vvith your Lordships leave) .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Help him to Pen, Ink, and Paper.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Record.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then we desire to go on in our Evidence. We
desire that Mr. <font>Oates</font> may not be interrupted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He shall not be interrupted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The first thing we will inquire, what
account he can give of the Prisoner at the Bar, whether
he was any way privy to the murther of the King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Oates</font> , we leave it to your      
self to
take your own way, and your own method: only this
we say, here's a Gentleman stands at the Bar for his life;
And on the other side, the King is concerned for His
life: you are to speak the truth and the whole truth;
for there is no reason in the world that you should adde
any one thing that is false. I would not have a tittle added
for any advantage, or consequences that may fall, when a
man's bloud and life lieth at stake: Let him be
condemned by truth: you have taken an Oath, and you being a
Minister, know the great regard you ought to have of
the sacredness of an Oath; and that to take a man's life
away by a false Oath is murther, I need not teach you
that. But that Mr. <font>Coleman</font> may be satisfied in the Trial,
and all people else be satisfied, there is nothing required or
expected, but downright plain truth, and without any
arts either to conceal, or expatiate, to make things larger
then in truth they are; he must be condemned by plain
Evidence of Fact.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr. <font>Coleman</font> in the Month of
<font>November</font> last, did entertain in his own House <font>John Keins</font> ,
which <font>John Keins</font> was a Father Confessor to certain
persons that were Converted, amongst which I was one.
My Lord, I went and visited this <font>John Keins</font> at Mr.
<font>Coleman's</font> House then in <font>Stable-yard</font> . Mr. <font>Coleman</font>        
inquiring
of <font>John Keins</font> who I was? He said, I was one that
designed to go over upon business to St. <font>Omers</font> . My Lord,
Mr. <font>Coleman</font> told me then he should trouble me with a
Letter or two to St. <font>Omers</font> , but he told me he would
leave them with one <font>Fenwick</font> that was Procurator for the
Society of Jesuits in <font>London</font> . I went on Monday
<pagebreak id="18" />
Morning and took Coach, went to <font>Dover</font> , and had his Pacquet
with me, which Pacquet when I came to St. <font>Omers</font> I
opened. The out-side sheet of this Paper was a Letter
of news which was called Mr. <font>Coleman's</font> Letter; and at the
bottome of this Letter there was this Recommendation,
Pray Recommend me to my Kinsman <font>Playford</font> . In this
Letter of news there were expressions of the King, calling
him Tyrant, and that the Marriage between the Prince of
<font>Orange</font> and the Lady <font>Mary</font> the Duke of <font>York's</font> Eldest
Daughter would prove the Traytour's and Tyrant's ruine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what language was it written?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In plain English words at length.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Directed to whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was directed to the Rectour of St.          
<font>Omers</font> ,
to give him intelligence how affairs went in <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you break it open?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was at the opening of it, and saw it and
read it. There was a Letter to Father <font>Lechees</font> , which was
superscribed by the same hand that the treasonable Letter of
news was written, and the same hand that the
recommendation to <font>Playford</font> was written in. When this Letter was  
open
there was a Seal fixt, a flying Seal and no mans Name to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Contents of that Letter to
<font>Lechees</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, to give you an account of
the import of this Letter, it was writ in <font>Latine</font> , and in
it there were thanks given to Father <font>Lechees</font> for the Ten
Thousand Pounds which was given for the propagation
of the Catholick Religion, and that it should be
imployed for no other intent and purpose but that for which it
was sent, now that was to cut off the King of <font>England</font> ; 
those words were not in that Letter, but <font>Lechees</font> Letter,
to which this was an Answer I saw and read: It was dated
the Month of <font>August</font> , and as near as I remember there was
this instruction in it, That the Ten Thousand Pound should
be employed for no other intent and purpose but to cut off
the King of <font>England</font> . I do not swear the words, but that's
<pagebreak id="19" />
the sense and substance; I believe I may swear the words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom was that directed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To one <font>Strange</font> that was then Provincial of
the Society in <font>London</font> , which Mr. <font>Coleman</font> answered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came Mr. <font>Coleman</font> to answer it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Strange</font> having run a Reed into his
Finger, had wounded his Hand, and Secretary <font>Mico</font> was
ill, so he got Mr. <font>Coleman</font> to write an Answer unto it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he write it as from himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, by order of the Provincial.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the substance of that Answer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That thanks was given to him in the Name
of the whole Society for the Ten Thousand Pound which
was paid and received here, and that it should be
employed to the intent for which it was received. It was
superscribed from Mr. <font>Coleman</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it subscribed <font>Coleman</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was not subscribed; I did not see him
write it, but I really believe it was by the same hand. I
went and delivered this Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understood you because of the 
accident of his Hand he had employed Mr. <font>Coleman</font> to write
this for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did write this Letter then, the Body of
the Letter was written by Mr. <font>Coleman</font> . I did not see him
write it, but I shall give an account how I can prove
he wrote it. I delivered this Letter to <font>Lechees</font> his own
hand. When I opened the Letter he asked me how a 
Gentleman (naming a French name) did doe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you carried this Letter, you
carried it to <font>Lechees</font> , and delivered it to him; then he
asked you of the Gentleman of the French name, whom meant
he by that name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understood it to be Mr. <font>Coleman</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he know him by some French name?
What said you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could say little to this.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could you guess whom he meant?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me he was sometime Secretary to
the Dutchess of <font>York</font> , which I understood to be Mr.
<font>Coleman</font> . I stuck at it, and when he said he was sometime
Secretary to the Dutchess of <font>York</font> , I spoke in Latine to
him, and asked whether he meant Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , and his
Answer I cannot remember. He sends an Answer to
this Letter. I brought it to St. <font>Omers</font> , and there it was
inclosed in the Letter from the Society to <font>Coleman</font> ; 
wherein the Society expresly told him this Letter was delivered
and acknowledged. I saw the Letter at St. <font>Omers</font> , and the
Letter was sent to him. Mr. <font>Coleman</font> did acknowledge the
Receit of this Letter from <font>Lechees</font> in the same hand with
that of the News Letter, and so it was understood by all,
I saw it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you to see it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I by a Patent from them was of the Consult.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You saw the Letter of the same hand
which the News Letter was of with Mr. <font>Coleman's</font> name
subscribed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The contents of the Letter did own the
Letter from <font>Lechees</font> was received; this Letter was presumed to
be the Hand-writing of Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , and it was
understood to be Mr. <font>Coleman's</font> Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say the Letter was thanks for the
Ten Thousand Pound; what was the other Contents?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That all endeavours should be used to cut
off the Protestant Religion Root and Branch.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you delivered this Letter, from
whom had you it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From <font>Fenwick</font> , it was left in his hand, and
he accompanied me from <font>Groves</font> to the Coach, and gave
it to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear him speak to Mr. <font>Coleman</font>
to write for him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Strange</font> told me he had spoke to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He doth suppose it was Mr. <font>Coleman's</font>
<pagebreak id="21" />
hand because it was just the same hand that the News
Letter was. Are you sure the Letter was of his hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was taken for his hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had he such a Kinsman there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes he hath confessed it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We desire your Lordship he may give an
account of the Consult here in <font>May</font> last, and how far
Mr. <font>Coleman</font> was privy to the murthering of the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Month of <font>April</font> Old-Stile, in the
Month of <font>May</font> New-Stile, there was a Consult held, it
was begun at the <font>White Horse Tavern</font> , it did not
continue there. After that there they had consulted to send one
Father <font>Cary</font> to be Agent and Procurator for <font>Rome</font> , they did
adjourn themselves to several Clubs in Companies; some
met at <font>Wild-House</font> , and some at <font>Harcourt's</font> Lodging in
<font>Dukes-Street</font> ; some met at <font>Ireland's</font> Lodging in
<font>Russel-Street</font> ; and some in <font>Fenwick's</font> Lodging in             
<font>Drury-Lane</font> .
They were ordered to meet by virtue of a Brief from <font>Rome</font> ,
sent by the Father Generall of the Society: They went on
to these Resolves, That <font>Pickering</font> and <font>Groves</font> should go on
and continue in attempting to Assassinate the King's Person
by Shooting, or other means. <font>Groves</font> was to have Fifteen
Hundred Pounds. <font>Pickering</font> being a Religious man was to
have Thirty Thousand Masses, which at Twelve Pence a
Mass amounted muchwhat to that money. This Resolve of 
the Jesuits was communicated to Mr. <font>Coleman</font> in my
hearing at <font>Wild-House</font> . My Lord, this was not onely so, 
but in several Letters he did mention it; and in one
Letter (I think I was gone a few miles out of <font>London</font> ) he sent
to me by a Messenger, and did desire the Duke might be
trappan'd into this Plot to Murther the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did he desire it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a Letter, that all means should be used
for the drawing in the Duke. This Letter was written to
one <font>Ireland</font> . I saw the Letter and read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know it was his Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because of the Instructions, which I saw
<pagebreak id="22" />
Mr. <font>Coleman</font> take a Copy of and write, which was the
same hand with the News Letter, and what else I have
mentioned, the Subscription was, <font>Recommend me to
Father Lechees</font> , and it was the same hand whereof I now speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the substance of the Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing but Complement, and
Recommendation, and that all means might be used for the
trappanning the Duke of <font>York</font> (as near as I can remember that
was the word.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You did say positively that Mr. <font>Coleman</font> 
did
consent and agree to what was consulted by the Jesuits,
which was to kill the King, and <font>Pickering</font> and <font>Groves</font>
were the two persons designed to do it. Did you hear
him consent to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard him say at <font>Wild-House</font> , he        
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT PLACES THE COMMA AFTER he</comment> thought it
was well contrived.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Recor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do the Gentlemen of the Jury hear what he saith?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen of the Jury, do you hear
what he saith?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of any Rebellion to
have been raised in <font>Ireland</font> ? and what was to be done with
the Duke of <font>Ormond</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Month of <font>August</font> there was a Consult
with the Jesuites, and with the Benedictine Monks at the
<font>Savoy</font> . In this Month of <font>August</font> there was a Letter writ from
Arch-Bishop <font>Talbot</font> , the Titular Arch-Bishop of <font>Dublin</font> ;
wherein he gave an account of a Legate from the Pope, an
<font>Italian</font> Bishop, (the Bishop of <font>Cassay</font> I think) who
asserted the Pope's Right to the Kingdom of <font>Ireland</font> . In this
Letter (to mention in special) there were Four Jesuits
had contrived to dispatch the Duke of <font>Ormond</font> (these
were his words) To find the most expedient way for
his death, and <font>Fogarthy</font> was to be sent to do it by
Poyson, if these Four good Fathers did not hit of their
Design. My Lord, <font>Fogarthy</font> was present. And when
the Consult was almost at a period, Mr. <font>Coleman</font> came
<pagebreak id="23" />
to the <font>Savoy</font> to the Consult, and was mighty forward to
have Father <font>Fogarthy</font> sent to <font>Ireland</font> to dispatch the
Duke by Poyson. This Letter did specify they were
there ready to rise in Rebellion against the King for the
Pope.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorney Generall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of
Arms?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were 40000 Black Bills, I am not so
skilfull in Arms to know what they meant (Military
Men know what they are) that were provided to be
sent into <font>Ireland</font> ; but they were ready for the use of the
Catholick Party.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who were they provided by?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know they were
provided?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Letter doth not mention who they
were provided by, but another Letter mentioned they
were provided by those that were Commission Officers
for the aid and help of the Pope; the Popish
Commissioners they were provided by, and they had them ready 
in <font>Ireland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who wrote this Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It came from <font>Talbot</font> , I might forget the  
day
of the Month because my Information is so large, but
it was the former part of the Year, I think either
<font>January</font> or <font>February</font> , (77) (78) last <font>January</font> or          
<font>February</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this Consult but in <font>August</font> last?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am forced to run back from that Consult to
this; Mr. <font>Coleman</font> was privy, and was the main Agent, and
did in the Month of <font>August</font> last past say to <font>Fenwick</font> , he had
found a way to transmit the 200000 <font>li.</font> for the carrying on
of this Rebellion in <font>Ireland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear him say so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did, a Week before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say he was very forward to send
<font>Fogarthy</font> into <font>Ireland</font> to kill the Duke of <font>Ormond</font> .
<pagebreak id="24" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes that I say; and that he had found a way to
transmit 200000 <font>li.</font> to carry on the Rebellion in <font>Ireland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was by besides <font>Fenwick</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My self and no body else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was it said?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Fenwick's</font> Chamber in <font>Drury-lane</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of transmitting
the money to <font>Windsor</font> , or perswading any to be sent
thither, and the time when?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Month of <font>August</font> there were four
Ruffians procured by Dr. <font>Fogarthy</font> . These Four were not
nominated in the Consult with the Benedictine Convent, but
(My Lord) these four Ruffians without names were
accepted of by them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who proposed them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Fogarthy</font> . These four Irish men were sent 
that
night to <font>Windsor</font> . How they went I know not, but the next
day there was a provision of 80 <font>li.</font> ordered to them by the
Rector of <font>London</font> , which is a Jesuite, one <font>Will. Harcourt</font> in
the name of the Provincial, because he acted in his name and
authority, the Provincial being then beyond the Seas,
visiting his Colledges in <font>Flanders</font> . 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he order the 80 <font>li.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Coleman</font> came to this <font>Harcourt's</font>   
House,
then lying in <font>Duke's-Street</font> , and <font>Harcourt</font> was not within;
but he was directed to come to <font>Wild-House</font> , and at
<font>Wild-House</font> he found <font>Harcourt</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he had been at his House, and was
not within, finding him at <font>Wild-House</font> , he asked what care
was taken for those four Gentlemen that went last night to
<font>Windsor</font> ? he said there was 80 <font>li.</font> ordered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who said so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Harcourt</font> . And there was the Messenger that
was to carry it, I think the most part of this 80 <font>li.</font> was in
Guineys: Mr. <font>Coleman</font> gave the Messenger a Guiney to be
nimble, and to expedite his Journey.
<pagebreak id="25" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How know you they were Guinies?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw the money upon the Table before         
<font>Harcourt</font> , not
in his hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Four <font>Irish</font> men there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they were gone before I came.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was to carry it after them, what    
was his
name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw him before or since; the Money    
was upon
the Table: when Mr. <font>Coleman</font> came in, he gave the messenger a
Guiney to expedite the business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say Mr. <font>Coleman</font> inquired what Care    
was taken
for those Ruffians that were to Assassinate the King; pray, Mr.      
<font>Oates</font> ,
tell my Lord and the Jury what you can say concerning Mr.
<font>Colemans</font> discourse with one <font>Ashby</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Moneth of <font>July</font> , one <font>Ashby</font> ,   
who was
sometimes Rector of St. <font>Omers</font> , being ill of the Gout was        
ordered to
go to the <font>Bath</font> ; this <font>Ashby</font> being in <font>London</font> , Mr.        
<font>Coleman</font> came to
attend him; this <font>Ashby</font> brought with him Treasonable
Instructions in order to expedite the King by Poison, provided       
<font>Pickering</font>
and <font>Groves</font> did not do the Work: Ten thousand pound should
be proposed to Sir <font>George Wakeman</font> to Poison the King, in case
Pistol and Stab did not take effect, and opportunity was to be
taken at the Kings taking Physick. I could give other Evidence
but will not, because of other things which are not fit to be
known yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who wrote this Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was under the hand of <font>White</font> the        
Provincial
beyond the Seas, whom <font>Ashby</font> left; it was in the name of
Memorials to impower <font>Ashby</font> and the rest of the Consulters at
<font>London</font> to propound Ten thousand pound to Sir <font>George Wakeman</font> to
take the opportunity to Poison the King. These Instructions
were seen and read by Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , by him Copied out, and
transmitted to several Conspirators of the Kings death, in this
Kingdom of <font>England</font> , that were privy to this Plot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Know you of any Commission? We have
hitherto spoken altogether of the work of others; now we come to
his own work a little nearer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who saw <font>Mr. Coleman</font> read these       
Instructions?
what said he?
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he thought it was too little, I      
heard him
say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see him take a Copy of these
Instructions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and he said he did believe Sir <font>George 
Wakeman</font>
would scarce take it, and thought it necessary the other Five
thousand pound should be added to it, that they might be sure
to have it done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was it he said this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in the Provincials Chamber, which     
<font>Ashby</font>
had taken for his convenience at <font>London</font> , until he went down to  
the
<font>Bath</font> , it was at <font>Wild-House</font> , at <font>Mr. Sandersons</font> house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Ashby</font> was imployed by his            
Instructions to
acquaint the Consult of the Jesuits, that there should be Ten
thousand pound advanced, if Doctor <font>Wakeman</font> would Poison the
King, now <font>Ashby</font> comes and acquaints him with it. Why should
<font>Coleman</font> take Copies?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because he was to send Copies to several
Conspirators in the Kingdom of <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what purpose should <font>Mr. Coleman</font>   
take a Copy
of these Instructions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The reason is plain, they were then a        
gathering a
Contribution about the Kingdom, and these Instructions were
sent that they might be incouraged, because they saw there was
incouragement from beyond Seas to assist them. And
another Reason was, because now they were assured by this their
business would quickly be dispatched, and by this means some
Thousands of pounds were gathered in the Kingdom of 
<font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom was <font>Mr. Coleman</font> to send them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not any of the Persons, but <font>Mr.     
Coleman</font>
did say he had sent his Suffrages (which was a Canting word
for Instructions) to the Principal Gentry of the Catholicks of
the Kingdom of <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How know you this, that <font>Mr. Coleman</font>  
did take a
Copy of these Instructions for that purpose as you say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because he said so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any body ask him why he took them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Saith <font>Ashby</font> , you had best make haste and
Communicate these things. <font>Mr. Coleman</font> answered, I will make      
haste with 
<pagebreak id="27" />
my Copies, that I may dispatch them away this night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he not to be one of the Principal         
Secretaries
of State?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Month of <font>May</font> last New Stile,      
<font>April</font> the Old
Stile, I think within a day after our Consult, I was at <font>Mr.
Langhorn's</font> Chamber, he had several Commissions, which he called
Patents: among his Commissions I saw one from the General
of the Society of <font>Jesus, Joannes Paulus D'Oliva</font> , by vertue of a
Brief from the Pope by whom he was enabled.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know his hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe I have seen it Forty times, I have 
seen Forty
things under his hand, and this agreed with them , but I never did see
him write in my life, we all took it to be his hand, and we all
knew the hand and Seal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Inscription was upon the Seal?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I. H. <comment type="compiler">CAPITAL GREEK LETTER SIGMA FOLLOWED  
BY A PERIOD</comment> with a Cross, in English it had the
Characters of I. H. S. This Commission to <font>Mr. Coleman</font> in the Month
of <font>July</font> , I saw in <font>Fenwicks</font> presence, and at his Chamber in  
<font>Drury-Lane</font> , where then <font>Mr. Coleman</font> did acknowledge the      
Receipt of this
Patent, opened it and said, It was a very good exchange.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Commission for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was to be Secretary of State. I saw the
Commission, and heard him own the Receipt of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Wild,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What other Commissions were there at <font>Mr.  
Langhorns</font> Chamber?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A great many, I cannot remember, there was a
Commission for my Lord <font>Arundel</font> of <font>Warder</font> , the Lord          
<font>Powis</font> , and
several other persons. But this belongs not to the Prisoner at the
Bar: I mention his Commission.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you acquainted with <font>Mr.           
Langhorn</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I'le tell your Lordship how I was       
acquainted, I
was in <font>Spain</font> , he had there two Sons; to shew them special favour
and kindness (being meer strangers at the Colledge) I did use to
transmit some Letters for them to the Kingdom of <font>England</font> in my
Pacquet. When I came out of <font>Spain</font> , I did receive
Recommendations from them to their Father, and in great civility he  
received
me. This was in <font>November</font> that I came to his house. He lived in
<font>Shear-lane</font> or thereabouts. I understood that his Wife was a
zealous Protestant; therefore he desired me not to come any more to
his house, but for the future to come to his Chamber in the           
<font>Temple</font> .
<pagebreak id="28" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you ever seen Mr. <font>Langhorn</font> in    
<font>London</font> before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw him till <font>Nov.</font> (77.) to my    
knowledge.
I was several times in his company at his chamber, and he brought
me there to shew me some kindness upon the account of his Sons.
It was at the <font>Temple</font> , for his Wife being a Protestant was not
willing any Jesuits should come to the house. I was to carry him a
summary of all the results and particulars of the Consult at the
<font>White Horse</font> and <font>Wild House</font> . The Provincial ordered me to do 
it, he
knowing me, being in that affair often imployed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it the second time you saw him, that 
you saw
the Commissions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him several times in the month of      
<font>November</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you see the Commissions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the month of <font>April</font> old stile, <font>May</font> 
new stile. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came he to shew you the Commissions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hearing of their being some, had a         
curiosity to
see them, and he knew me to be privy to the concerns.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did you know he had the Commissions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By Letters. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From    
whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From those of the Society at <font>Rome</font> ,      
wherein one
<font>Harcourt</font> one of the Fathers was certified, that the Commissions
were come to <font>Langhorn</font> , and were in his hand, I saw the Letters at
St. <font>Omers</font>  before they came to <font>Harcourt</font> , we read the        
Letters there
before they came to <font>England</font> , I had power to open them.          
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you open the Letters?                
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When saw you the Letters at St.          
<font>Omers</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw the Letters at St. <font>Omers</font> in the    
month of <font>January</font> ;
then they came from <font>Rome</font> ; and after I received summons to be at
this Consult in the month of <font>April</font> ; and accordingly we came over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat time did you come over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the month of <font>April</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat time went you to <font>Langhorns</font>     
chamber? I
cannot reconcile the months together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not say you came to <font>Langhorn</font>  
in <font>November</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, before I went to St. <font>Omers</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many came over with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell how many came over together;    
there
were nine of us all Jesuits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not say you went to <font>Langhorn</font> 
in <font>November</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was before I went to St. <font>Omers</font> .
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell how many Priests or Jesuits were      
lately in 
<font>England</font> , that you know of, at one time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was, and have been to my knowledge in the
Kingdom of <font>England</font> , Secular Priests eightscore, and Jesuits
fourscore, and by name in the Catalogue, I think three hundred and   
odd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long had you been in <font>England</font>     
before you were
at Mr. <font>Langhorn's</font> Chamber?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not long; because I had Letters in my Pacquet 
from
his Sons, assoon as I had rested a little, I went to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What said Mr. <font>Langhorn</font> to you about  
the
Commissions in his chamber?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not a word; but seem'd glad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see them open upon his Table? or 
did
you ask to see them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did not lye open upon the Table, but the
Commissions were before him; I asked to see them. Mr. <font>Langhorn</font>   
(said I)
I hear you have received the Commissions from <font>Rome</font> ; he said, he 
had.
Shall I have the honour to see some of them? He said, I might; he
thought he might trust me; and so he might, because that very day
I gave him an account of the Consult.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was it you gave him an account of the
Consult?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you were twice there that day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was there the whole Forenoon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That day you saw the Commissions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had been there several times the same day,  
and
meeting him at last, he asked me how often I was there before, I said
said twice or thrice; but that day was the last time ever I saw him; I
have not seen him since to my knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was that the first time that you saw him 
after you
came from <font>Spain</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him thrice in <font>November</font> , then I     
went to St. <font>Omers</font> ,
the first time I saw him after I came from thence I saw the
Commissions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What were the Names of those men that came 
over
from St. <font>Omers</font> besides your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As near as I can remember, the Rector of      
<font>Liege</font> was
one; Father <font>Warren</font> ; Sir <font>Thomas Preston</font> ; the Rector of      
<font>Watton</font> ; one
<font>Francis Williams</font> ; Sir <font>John Warner</font> Baronet ; one Father      
<font>Charges</font> ;
one <font>Pool</font> , a <font>Monk</font> ; I think I made the ninth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Prisoner at the Bar be minded, he   
may ask
him any Question.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am mighty glad to see that Gentleman Sir    
<font>Thomas
Dolman</font> in the Court, for I think he was upon my Examination before
the Councel, and this man that gives now in Evidence against me,
there told the King, he never saw me before; and he is extreamly well
acquainted with me now, and hath a World of Intimacy. <font>Mr. Oates</font>
at that time gave such an Account of my Concern in this matter, that
I had orders to go to <font>Newgate</font> , I never saw <font>Mr. Oates</font> since  
I was
born, but at that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have as fair a Search, and     
Examination
in this matter for your Life as can be, therefore <font>Mr. Oates</font>      
answer to
what <font>Mr. Coleman</font> saith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, when <font>Mr. Coleman</font> was upon his
Examination before the Council-board, he saith, I said there that I  
never
saw him before in my Life: I then said I would not swear that I
had seen him before in my Life, because my sight was bad by
Candle-light, and Candle-light alters the sight much, but when I heard
him speak I could have sworn it was he, but it was not then my
Business. I cannot see a great way by Candle-light.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Stress of the Objection lyeth not   
upon seeing
so much, but how come you that you laid no more to <font>Mr. Coleman's</font>
charge at that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did design to lay no more to his Charge    
then,
than was matter for Information. For Prisoners may
supplant Evidence when they know it, and bring Persons to such
Circumstances, as Time, and Place. My Lord, I was not bound to
give in more than a general Information against Mr. <font>Coleman</font> ;    
<font>Mr.
Coleman</font> did deny he had Correspondence with Father <font>Le Chese</font> at
any time, I did then say he had given him an account of several
transactions. And (my Lord) then was I so weak, being up two nights, 
and having been taking Prisoners, upon my Salvation, I could
scarce stand upon my Legs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Information you gave at     
that time to
the Council against Mr. <font>Coleman</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Information I gave at that time (as near 
as I can
remember, but I would not trust to my memory) was for writing
of <font>News-Letters</font> , in which I did then excuse the Treasonable     
Reflexions,
and called them Base Reflexions at the Council-board; the King was
sensible, and so was the Council. I was so wearied and tyred (being
all that Afternoon before the Council, and Sunday night, and sitting
up night after night) that the King was willing to discharge me. But
if I had been urged, I should have made a larger Information.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The thing you accused him of was his own 
Letter. <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Lettter</comment>

you were Examined at the Council-Table, you gave a particular

he found out a way of transmitting 200000 pounds to carry on the

well. And of the Instructions for 10000 pounds, and said it was too
little for to poyson the King. When you were to give an account to
the Council of the particular Contrivance of the Murther of the King
at <font>Windsor</font> , with a Reward, you did mention one Reward of 10000
pounds to Dr. <font>Wakeman</font> , and would you omit the Guinny to
expedite the Messenger, and that he said that 10000 <font>l.</font> was too   
little; would
you omit all this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I being so tyred and weak that I was not     
able to stand
upon my Legs, and I remember the Council apprehended me to be
so weak that one of the Lords of the Council said, that if there were
any occasion further to examine <font>Mr. Coleman</font> , that <font>Mr. Oates</font> 
should
be ready again, and bid me retire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You was by when the Council were ready to    
let Mr.
<font>Coleman</font> go almost at large.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I never apprehended that, for if I did,  
I should
have given a further Account.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was done to Mr. <font>Coleman</font> at that    
time? was he sent
away Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, at that time to the Messengers house,   
and within
two dayes after he was sent to <font>Newgate</font> , and his Papers were     
seized.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you not name <font>Coleman</font> at that    
time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I had spent a great deal of time in  
accusing
other Jesuites.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time was there betwixt the first time  
you were at
the Council before you told of this matter concerning the King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I was first at the Board (which was on  
<font>Saturday</font>
night) I made Information, which began between six and seven, and
lasted almost to ten. I did then give a general Account of the Affairs
to the Council without the King. Then I went and took Prisoners,
and before <font>Sunday</font> night, I said, I thought if Mr. <font>Colemans</font>   
Papers
were searched into, they would find matter enough against him in
those Papers to hang him; I spake those words, or words to the like
purpose. After that Mr. <font>Colemans</font> Papers were searched, Mr. 
<font>Coleman</font> was not to be found; but he surrendred himself the next  
day.
<pagebreak id="32" />
So that on <font>Sunday</font> I was commanded to give His Majesty a general
Information, as I had given to the Council on <font>Saturday</font> ; and the
next day again, I took Prisoners that night five, and next night four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it betwixt the time that you   
were examined,
and spoke only as to the Letters, to that time you told to the King
&amp; Council or both of them, concerning this matter you swear now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I never told it to the King and     
Council, but
I told it to the Houses of Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it between the one and the  
other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell exactly the time; it was when  
the
Parliament first sate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you, <font> (Mr. Coleman being so          
desperate a man as
he was, endeavouring the killing of the King) </font> to omit your        
<font>Information</font>
of it to the Council and to the King at both times?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> spoke little of the Persons till the    
persons came face to
face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you not accuse all those Jesuits 
by name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We took a Catalogue of their names, but       
those <font>I</font> did
accuse positively and expresly we took up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not accuse Sir <font>George          
Wakeman</font> by name,
and that he accepted his Reward?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Oates.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, then <font>I</font> did accuse him by name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you not accuse Mr. <font>Coleman</font>   
by name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Oates.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>For want of Memory; being disturbed and wearied in
sitting up two nights, I could not give that good account of Mr.</font>   
Coleman 
<font>which I did afterwards, when I consulted my Papers; and when I saw
Mr.</font> Coleman <font>was secured, I had no need to give a farther         
Account</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it between the first        
charging Mr. 
<font>Coleman</font> , and your acquainting the Parliament with it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Oats.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>From Monday the</font> 30th <font>of</font> September, until the
Parliament sate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , will you ask him any   
thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Prisoner.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pray ask Mr.</font> Oats, <font>whether he was not as near 
to me as
this Gentleman is, because he speaks of his eyes being bad</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Oats.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I had the disadvantage of a Candle upon my eyes;  
Mr.</font>
Coleman <font>stood more in the dark</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He names several times that he met with me in 
this place
and that place, a third and fourth place about business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Oats.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>He was altered much by his Perriwig in several    
Meetings,
and had several Perriwiggs, and a Perriwigg doth disguise a man very
much; but when I heard him speak, then I knew him to be Mr.</font> Coleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear him speak? How were the     
Questions
asked? Were they thus? Was that the Person? Or, how often had you
seen Mr. <font>Coleman</font> ?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Question was asked by my Lord
Chancellour, Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , when were you last in <font>France</font> ?
He said at such a time. Did you see Father <font>le Chese</font> ? He
said he gave him an accidental visit, My Lord Chancellor
asked him whether or no he had a Pass? He said, No.
Then he told him, that was a fault for going out of the
Kingdom without a Pass. Have you a Kinsman whose name
is <font>Playford</font> at S. <font>Omers</font> ? He said he had one ten years
old, (who is in truth sixteen.) That question I desired
might be asked. Then the King bade me go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the King, or Council, or Lord
Chancellor ask you whether you knew Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did not ask me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Oats</font> , answer the question in      
short, and
without confounding it with length. Were you demanded
if you knew M. <font>Coleman</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not to my knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see him? or how often?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, he did not know me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seemed, when I asked you before, to
admit, as if you had been asked this question, how often
you had seen him, and gave me no answer, because you
were doubtful whether it was the man, by reason of the
inconveniency of the light, and your bad sight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must leave it to the King what answer I made
Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , he wonders I should give an account of so
many intimacies, when I said I did not know him at the
Council Table.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is very strange Mr. <font>Oats</font> should swear now, 
that
he was so well acquainted with me, and had been so often
in my company, when upon his accusation at the 
Council-Table, he said nothing of me more than the sending of one
Letter, which he thought was my hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not say that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And he did seem to say there, he never saw me
before in his life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he asked whether he was acquainted
with you? (for those words are to the same purpose) .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot answer directly, I do not say he was
asked if he was acquainted with me, but I say this, that he
did declare he did not know me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you prove that?
<pagebreak id="38" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I appeal to Sir <font>Tho. Dolman</font> , who is now in
Court, and was then present at the Council-Table.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Thomas</font> , you are not upon your Oath,
but are to speak on the behalf of the Prisoner: what did
he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tho. Dolman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That he did not well know him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he add, that he did not well know him
by the Candle-light? But Mr. <font>Oats</font> , when you heard his
voice, you said you knew him; why did you not come then, 
and say you did well know him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I was not asked.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, Sir <font>Thomas</font> , did he say he did    
not well 
know him after M. <font>Coleman</font> spake? Was Mr. <font>Coleman</font>
examined before Mr. <font>Oats</font> spake?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tho. Dolman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Oats</font> , you say you were with him   
at the
<font>Savoy</font> and <font>Wild-house</font> , pray, Sir <font>Thomas</font> , did he say he  
did
not know him, or had seen Mr. <font>Coleman</font> there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tho. Dolman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did not know him as he stood there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Knowing, or not knowing is not the present
question; but did he make an answer to the knowing, or
not knowing him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Just. Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say he did not well know Mr. 
<font>Coleman</font> , or that he did not well know that man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tho. Dolman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he had no acquaintance with
that man (to the best of my remembrance.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Robert Southwell</font> , you were        
present at Mr.
<font>Oats</font> his Examination before the Council; in what manner
did he accuse Mr. <font>Coleman</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The question is so particular, I
cannot give the Court satisfaction; but other material things
then said are now omitted by Mr. <font>Oats</font> ; for he did declare
against Sir <font>George Wakeman</font> , that five thousand pounds was
added, in all fifteen thousand pounds, and that Mr. <font>Coleman</font>
paid five of the fifteen to Sir <font>George</font> in hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This answers much of the Objection upon him.
The Court has asked Mr. <font>Oats</font> how he should come now to
charge you with all these matters of poysoning and killing
the King, and yet he mentioned you so slightly at
the Council-Table; but it is said by Sir <font>Robert Southwell</font>
he did charge you with five thousand pounds (for poisoning
the King) to be added to the ten thousand pounds, and he
<pagebreak id="39" />
charged you expresly with it at the Council Table.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Charge was so slight against me by Mr.        
<font>Oats</font> , that
the Council were not of his Opinion: For the first order was
to go to <font>Newgate</font> , and Sir <font>Robert Southwell</font> came with
directions to the Messenger not to execute the Order. I humbly ask
whether it was a reasonable thing to conceive that the
Council should extenuate the punishment, if Mr. <font>Oats</font> came with
such an amazing account to the Council,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Rob. South.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr <font>Oats</font> gave so large and general an
Information to the Council, that it could not easily be fixed.
Mr. <font>Coleman</font> came voluntarily in upon Monday morning. The 
Warrant was sent out on Sunday night for Mr. <font>Coleman</font> and
his Papers: His Papers were found and seized; but Mr.
<font>Coleman</font> was not found at that time, nor all Night, but came on
Monday morning voluntarily, and offered himself at Sir
<font>Joseph Williamson's</font> House, hearing there was a Warrant against
him: By reason of so many Prisoners that were then under
Examination, he was not heard till the Afternoon, and then
he did with great Indignation and Contempt hear these vile
things, as thinking himself innocent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pris.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I thought my self guilty, I should have charged
my self: I hope his Majesty upon what hath been said, will
be so far satisfied as to discharge me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Rob. South.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Coleman</font> then made so good a      
discourse
for himself, that though the Lords had filled up a blank
Warrant to send him to <font>Newgate</font> , that was respited, and he was
only committed to a Messenger. I did say to the Messenger,
be very civil to Mr. <font>Coleman</font> for things are under
Examination, but you must keep him safely. Saith the Messenger,
pray let me have a special Warrant, that doth dispence with
the Warrant I had to carry him to <font>Newgate</font> , and such a
Warrant he had. The King went away on Tuesday
morning to <font>Newmarket</font> , and appointed a particular Committee to
examine the Papers brought of Mr. <font>Coleman</font> and others.
   His Papers were found in a Deal box, and several of these
Papers and Declarations sounded so strangely to the Lords,
that they were amazed; and presently they signed a 
Warrant for Mr. <font>Coleman's</font> going to <font>Newgate</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Oats</font> give a round Charge against
Mr. <font>Coleman</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Rob. South.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He had a great deal to do, he was to
<pagebreak id="40" />
repeat in the Afternoon on Sunday when the King was present,
all he had said to the Lords on Saturday.
   He did say of Mr. <font>Coleman</font> , that he had corresponded very
wickedly and basely with the French King's Confessor, and
did believe if Mr. <font>Coleman's</font> Papers were searched, there
would be found in them that which would cost him his Neck.
And did declare that the fifteen thousand pounds was
accepted for the murther of the King, and that five thousand
pounds was actually paid by Mr. <font>Coleman</font> to Sir <font>George 
Wakeman</font> . But Mr. <font>Oats</font> at the same time did also declare that he
did not see the mony paid, he did not see this particular
action of Sir <font>George Wakeman</font> , because at the time he had the
Stone and could not be present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not present at that Consult, where the
fifteen thousand pounds was accepted, but I had an account
of it from those that were present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It appears plainly by this Testimony, that 
he
did charge you Mr. <font>Coleman</font> home, that fifteen thousand
pounds was to be paid for poysoning the King, and that it
was generally said among them (though he did not
see it paid) that it came by your hands, <font>viz.</font> five
thousand pounds of it, which answers your objection as if he
had not charged you, when you see he did charge you home
then for being one of the Conspirators, in having a hand
in paying of money for poysoning the King: he charges you
now no otherwise than in that manner. He doth not charge
you now as if there were new things started, but with the
very conspiracy of having a hand in paying the money for
murthering the King. 

   What consultation was that you had at the Savoy, in the 
Month of <font>August</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Oats.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was about the business of the four Irish
Ruffians proposed to the Consult.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The end of Mr.</font> Oats's <font>Examination</font> .</nonSpeech>
