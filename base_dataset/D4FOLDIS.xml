<omission type="line" /> I never thought,
<pagebreak id="44" />
Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd the Lord <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
that I <font>cou'd</font> have been so unhappy as
not to subscribe to ev'ry <font>particular</font>
Opinion of your Ladyship's, till this
unlucky Moment: But, Madam 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (continued he, applying himself to
<font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am yet more unfortunately
mistaken, if you don't think this Air
more agreeable to the Sweetness of
your Complexions, than the Smoaky
Climat of <font>that, still unsatisfy'd, and
unhallow'd</font> , tho' <font>pretended</font> , Sanctify'd
Place. And I fear, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (added
he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that your apprehensions of such a
retreat from the Gay World, threw
you into a Melancholly, which might
have been no less fatal to me, and all
the admiring World, than to your
Ladyship; had not Heaven preserv'd
<font>the nearest Copy of it self in you</font> , to
be ador'd by all Mankind -- My Lord
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did really Arm my
self against all <font>Modesty</font> , e're I came
abroad, <font>expecting</font> , indeed, to receive
such Volleys of your Wit and
Gallantry. </dialogue><nonSpeech> -- She had gone on still;
had not <font>Stopwell</font> , approaching 'em with
Mr. <font>Worthygrace</font> , and his Equipage,
<pagebreak id="45" />
prevented her. -- </nonSpeech><dialogue> My most Honour'd
Lady! </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd he out aloud) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and my
Divine Mistress <font>Philandra</font> ! How
happy I am to see your Ladyship so well
recover'd in your Health and Beauty,
as to adorn this Walk with what it
so long has wanted in your absence? --
Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (interrupted <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr.
<font>Stopwell</font> wrongs the Court-Ladies;
some of which are really Great
Beauties, who frequently do bless this
Park. But, pardon me, Madam I
beseech you, if I think <font>you</font> have done
'em the greater injury; in appearing
here so much to their disadvantage. --
'Sdeath! -- what Spark's this? </dialogue><nonSpeech> (crys
<font>Bellamant</font> to himself; with a jealous
frown and an angry blush) but straight
recalling himself (said he to
<font>Worthygrace</font> aloud) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, the Lady is out
o'danger of being Flatter'd; and you may
go on at the same rate, if you please.
But </dialogue><nonSpeech> (interrupted <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you may
assure your self (my Lord) it will not
altogether please <font>me</font> : And I cou'd
wish, the Gentleman would spare
himself the trouble of a second thought.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>At this they both bow'd very humbly,
<pagebreak id="46" />
and were silent: And (then said the
Lady <font>Gripely</font> taking up the Discourse) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
but, in the name of Wonder, (Mr.
<font>Stopwell</font> ) how came you to find us
here? Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd the
<font>Coupe`-Marchant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> hearing that my Divine
Mistress was taken Sick upon her
return to Town, I thought it my
indispensible Duty to pay my Respects to
her, in enquiring of her Health, if I
might not have been permitted the
Honour and Happiness of seeing her;
and this Afternoon I had the good
Fortune to learn from Sir <font>Beetlehead</font> ,
then at home, that your Ladyships
were gone towards the Park; 
whereupon, as I was going to call a Coach,
this worthy Gentleman, my Honour'd
Friend prevented me, by taking me
into his own Coach; he designing for
a Walk in this place. </dialogue><nonSpeech>While they
were thus discoursing <font>Worthygrace</font>
happen'd to fix his Eye on the Lady
<font>Arabella</font> ; where (perhaps) he
discover'd as much Beauty and Goodness
as ever was confin'd to one Person:
And (no doubt) he had thought so;
had he not been prepossess'd with
<pagebreak id="47" />
a Passion for <font>Philandra</font> ; however, at
the same time, he cou'd not but be
somewhat touch'd with <font>Arabella</font> ; and
was not a little surpriz'd to see two
Persons so exactly alike as the Lady
<font>Bellamant</font> and <font>Arabella</font> . Mean while,
on t'other side <font>Bellamant</font> taking
<font>Philandra's</font> hand, and walking some few
paces from the Company; ask'd her
if she knew that Gentleman, she
answer'd, that this was the second time
she had ever seen him; giving him an
account withal of what had pass'd
between 'em at their first sight, the
day before she came to Town.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed
(Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said my Lord) </nonSpeech><dialogue> he makes a
very Graceful Figure, and speaks
well; -- Pray Heav'n and you,
Madam, it prove not to my
disadvantage: No; no (my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> your Lordship does not conquer by
halves. -- I fear I have said too much
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (added she with a blush) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but make the
best and kindest use on't you can for
both our Interests. Ah Madam 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd he, in a transport) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you have
almost taken away from me the power
to thank you for this mighty Blessing,
<pagebreak id="48" />
and to assure you, that I can have no
Interest but what I must Centre in
yours. -- But I don't like this
same Dancing-Master; I fancy he
helps to play the Game against me.
No matter my Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> since I
deal, you are safe. -- But, come let us
joyn Company; for the Lady your
Sister is at loss for us. Alas, my
Memory! </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had
forgot till now to tell you, (Madam)
that she came with me hither
particularly to Kiss your hands, e're she goes
to a Relation of ours who is a Lady
Abbess in <font>France</font> ; with whom she
designs to stay near a Twelvemonth;
beginning her journey about three
days hence: </dialogue><nonSpeech>By this time they were
come up with the rest of the
Company, when <font>Philandra</font> told <font>Arabella</font> ,
that she was sorry to hear she must all
on a suddain lose the happiness of
her Charming Conversation, which
she had as well promis'd to her self,
as wish'd to enjoy all the days of her
life.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Arabella</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I
have had so great a desire of
seeing some part of <font>France</font> these many
<pagebreak id="49" />
Years; that I cou'd no longer defer
giving my self that satisfaction:
Especially, since my Lady <font>Abbess</font> is now so
pressing in her Invitation: And,
unless your Ladyship will lay your
absolute Commands on me to the
contrary; I must leave <font>England</font> within
these few days: Ah Madam!
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can pretend to no
such influence in your Ladyships
Actions: Besides, if I might, with
<font>Reason</font> , you may assure your self, that,
I wou'd rather wholly disquiet my
self, than give the least <font>least interruption</font>
to your Ladyships pleasure. That were
too great a Condenscension in you,
Madam, to me; </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Arabella</font> ;) </nonSpeech><dialogue> since
you may be confident, that you have
an Arbitrary and Dispensing power in
every thing relating to my Brother.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>During this Discourse between 'em,
<font>Worthygrace</font> was examining the
difference of their Beauties; and found
much more of Modesty and Sweetness
in <font>Arabella's</font> Face, than Air and
Gayety, which did chiefly reside in
<font>Philandra's</font> ; who yet had a Languishing
cast with her Eye at some times;
<pagebreak id="50" />
when she design'd an Absolute
Conquest; which did not a little denote
her cunning: And 'twas this had
vanquish'd him more than the noise of
her thirty thousand pounds Portion:
For he was truly Generous, and
lov'd for loves sake; and, that most
passionately. -- But now,
removing his Eyes from their belov'd object,
and turning 'em on t'other side; he
found the Lord <font>Bellamant</font> surveying
him from Head to Foot: Which
made <font>Worthygrace</font> as nicely examin
him. At last, after a short encountre
of their Eyes:</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Well, Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
my Lord) </nonSpeech><dialogue> what have you observ'd
about me to my Advantage? I fear,
nothing at all, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (continu'd he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but
what makes wholly for yours. So
much on the contrary; </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd he) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
that I assure your Lordship, I wou'd
not have you for a Rival of all
Mankind: And I cou'd wish, with your
Lordships Pardon, that you were not
only <font>like</font> that Beautiful Lady </dialogue><nonSpeech> (added
he, bowing to <font>Arabella</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> in
outward Figure alone, but ev'n in her
very Sex. I must avow to you, my
<pagebreak id="51" />
Lord, 'twou'd give me a great deal
of ease. Methinks, Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
<font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you look on me <font>already</font> as one
that is a Disturber of your joys. If I
do, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
you are too secure in your own
Merits to fear any attempt from me.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>As they were thus entertaining one
another, Sir <font>Blunder</font> pass'd 'em on
one side of the Mall, close to the
Walk that leads to St. <font>James's</font> House,
observing them most narrowly; but
unobserv'd of them. It seems, he
was near enough to take notice that
<font>Bellamant</font> led <font>Philandra</font> , and whisper'd
very frequently with her: That
<font>Stepwell</font> usher'd the Lady <font>Gripely</font> ; and
<font>Worthygrace</font> , as yet a stranger to him,
was fain to take up with the Finest
Creature there: I mean, <font>Arabella</font> .
What <font>Bellamant</font> and <font>Philandra</font>
whisper'd seem'd to <font>Slouch</font> at that
distance, to be some Assignation, or
some Damn'd Love-Intrigue, or other,
not at all in favour of him. An
hundred times did he wish that he had
been in my Lord's Heart; or at
least, that he had his Ears:
<pagebreak id="52" />
he durst not venture to go near enough
for either of 'em, for fear of a
Reprimand from <font>Bellamant</font> , who by this
time was acquainted with the whole
story of his Villany: At last, all on a
suddain, clapping her hand on her
left side, <font>Philandra</font> miss'd the Letter
she received from my Lord the day
before. This made her stand as fix'd
as the Statue at the end of the Canal:
But in a more defenceless posture.
For, she had already receiv'd a second
blow from Fortune; and there was no
guarding her self against what was
past. By her looks on <font>Bellamant</font> , she
appear'd strangely mortify'd at 
something; which all the Company took
notice of, upon that suddain motion
of her's with her hand.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Art not well,
my Dear? </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd the Lady <font>Gripely</font> ,
running hastily to her) </nonSpeech><dialogue> yes, Madam
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (answered she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> pretty well now; I
humbly thank your Ladiship. 'Twas
only a stitch that took me on the
suddain; and as quickly has left me.
Ha! </dialogue><nonSpeech> (thought <font>Slouch</font> , all this
while watching ev'ry particular
motion of the whole Company;
<pagebreak id="53" />
especially <font>Bellamant's</font> , and <font>Philandra's</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I
can tell your Distemper better than
Mr. <font>Physmacary</font> himself: For I have
the occasion of it here in my Pocket,
which I will so improve, that you shall
either marry me, or dye of the Pip,
and so lead Apes in Hell. I'm now
going to your Father, and consequently
every step I make is towards her Bad. 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Saying so, he left the <font>Park</font> , and them
to follow him, which they did in less
than an hour after, fearing the Air
might be too sharp for <font>Philandra's</font>
longer stay there the first time; every
one expressing their real grief for the
apprehension they had of the return of
her Distemper. At the end of the
<font>Mall</font> they were oblig'd to part;
<font>Philandra</font> and her Mother for the City,
the Lady <font>Arabella</font> with her Attendant
and one Footman return'd to their
Lodgings in <font>Soho-Square</font> ; for my Lord
would needs take a Bottle with
<font>Worthygrace</font> at the <font>Blue-Posts</font> in the
<font>Hay-Market</font> , where they did very
pleasantly with <font>Stepwell</font> , drinking to
<font>Philandra's</font> Health, and discoursing of
their Travels; in which, <font>Worthygrace</font>
<pagebreak id="54" />
had much the advantage, having
stayed some time in most of the Princes
Courts in <font>Europe. Bellamant</font> having
only made the Tour of <font>France</font> , and
some short stay at <font>Rome</font> , and <font>Venice</font> .
After which, he spent somewhat more
than a Twelvemonth in the Court of
<font>France</font> , and the Campaign. Having
drank and talk'd their heads pretty
empty of further thought, and eaten
their bellies full, they took a very
obliging farewell of each other, both
extreamly satisfied with one anothers
merit, but not a little dissatisfied that
they found they were Rivals;
however, they Convers'd, and parted
like Persons of Honour, expecting
from <font>Philandra</font> the fatal
determination of their happiness, or misery.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>In the mean time, as they were
making homewards, <font>Philandra</font> , looking
very earnestly on <font>Mariana</font> , ask'd her
if she had not met with a Letter 
among the Linnen which she had put
off that day? To which she reply'd,
That indeed she took up a Paper that
lay on the ground, and because she
could not read it, she gave it to Sir
<pagebreak id="55" />
<font>Blunder</font> , who told her that 'twas
only a new Song which her Ladyship
had transcrib'd; and that therefore
she took no farther notice of it, but
left it with him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>O thou Screech-Owl</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd Philandra, <font>all in a flame</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>what
do I hear? Oh! thou hast betray'd me
to the</font> greatest <font>of misfortunes, exposing
me to the base practices of that Eternal
Booby</font> Slouch. <font>O most unfortunate
accident</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd the Mother) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>another
Letter faln into his hands</font> ! <font>Madam</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
<font>Mariana</font> , about to justifie her self.) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Be
dumb, be dumb for ever here on Earth</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (interrupted <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>or if thou needs
must yell, howl out inevitable
Damnation to Despairing Souls! Oh! It were
Charity to what th'hast done! what!
Sacrific'd a second time to that Slave's
Interest? 'Twere merciless I'm sure, in</font>
Humanity, <font>to act thus, but</font> Heaven <font>I hope
has kinder ends in it. Ah! Madam</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (pursu'd she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>how shall we meet my
jealous Father, who is byass'd in every thing
by that hated Fiend</font> . <font>No doubt</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd the Mother) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>the Greeting will
be very extraordinary: Fools that we
were</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (pursued she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>not to perceive 'till
<pagebreak id="56" />
now, that this sly Minks is a meer tool of
his! his Creature; foisted upon us, to serve
his hated ends</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>All this while the
plaguy Gypsy sate sobbing and
blubbering, and staining with her Crocodile
tears her Handkerchief, which before
was as white as innocence: At last,
with much difficulty she sputter'd out,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Madam, if your Ladyship thinks that I
have designedly injur'd you in this, I
humbly beg your Ladyship to dismiss me
your Service, for I had rather be robb'd
of that Happiness and Honour, than
live under your Ladyship's Displeasure,
and Suspicion</font> . <font>Ah! wou'd to Heaven</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd Philandra) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you had propos'd this
some weeks ago, it might perhaps for
ever have establish'd my Peace and Quiet,
which now I fear is utterly ruin'd.
However</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (continu'd she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>your Request,
tho' much with the latest, is very
grateful to me, and you may be confident you
shall not be long without your wish, if
my honour'd Mother has no further
Commands for you</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Little did she think
that this dismission would be as wellcome
to</font> Mariana, <font>as it was obliging to her:
But I can assure you, it had been of
<pagebreak id="57" />
equal advantage to all three, had it not
been for a slippery Trick that Fortune
play'd this unluckie Damsel</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- <font>No,
no</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd the Lady <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>my last
Command to her is, that she continue in
the Resolution of leaving us, and that
by to morrow this time</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>At these words
they found themselves just at their
own door, which the Mother and
Daughter enter'd, but with aking
hearts, for-boding but a sorrowful
reception, which was reserv'd (it
seems by the two ill-natur'd
Blockheads agreement) to a more
convenient time. For <font>Slouch</font> immediately
upon his leaving the <font>Park</font> , came and
found <font>Gripeley</font> at home, and took him to
the Coffee-House, where he
recounted to him all the Discourse between
the Mother and Daughter, as he had
learn'd it from <font>Mariana</font> ; shewing
<font>Bellamant's</font> Letter to <font>Philandra</font> ; and
withall, gave him an account of the
Honourable Company he had seen
with them in the <font>Mall</font> . He chose
rather to take him to a Coffee-House,
there to distract him with this
Relation, than his own House, fearing the
<pagebreak id="58" />
Ladies might return, and surprize
him as he was doing 'em that signal
piece of Knight's Service. The
Ladies had just time to quit themselves
of that part of their Dress which was
unnecessary in the House, when Old
<font>Gripely</font> and <font>Slouch</font> came to 'em: the
last of which (as it was contriv'd
between 'em, over a Cup of the Devil's
Communion-Wine) after having paid
his Respects to the Ladies, came up
closer to <font>Philandra</font> , and taking the
Letter out of his Pocket, convey'd it
into her hand, as it were unperceiv'd
of the Old Gentleman; who began to
wellcome home his Lady Wife with
all the Sugar-plum-words he us'd to
feed her with at his first Courtship.
This was surprizing, and kind; and,
I am apt to believe, it was one of their
last Honey-Nights: but for a
fortnight after <font>Philandra</font> was under a
severer restraint than ever; During all
which time, she could not receive one
<font>Billet-Doux</font> from either my Lord, or
<font>Worthygrace</font> , tho' they both had
endeavour'd to supply her a hundred
times, and a hundred ways, with those
<pagebreak id="59" />
Paper-Refections; especially the Lord
<font>Bellamant</font> : Who meeting <font>Stepwell</font> one
Day about Noon, desir'd him to take
one Bottle with him at the <font>Rose</font> in
<font>Covent-Garden</font> : So to <font>Long's</font> they
came, where, after a Glass or two,
<font>Bellamant</font> enquir'd of <font>Worthygrace's</font>
health, and drank to the continuance
of it. Then he proceeded to ask
<font>Stepwell</font> when he had been at Mr.
<font>Beetleheads</font> , and how Matters went with
<font>Philandra</font> , since they last saw her in
the Park? Of which <font>Stepwell</font> could give
him no further account, than that he
understood she was now more strictly
confin'd than ever. My Lord then
taking him by the hand, presented
him with Fifty Guineas, and told him
withall, that he must thence forward
beg his Friendship; at the same time
assuring him of his, and that he wou'd
use his interest at Court, or any where
else, to serve him at any time. To
which he very obediently reply'd,
<font>That his Life, and all his
Circumstances, both Present, and Future, were,
and shou'd be always at his Lordship's
Devotion, except his Reputation, which
<pagebreak id="60" />
he was confident my Lord wou'd never
engage him to hazzard</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr.</font> Stepwell
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said the Lord <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>had I thought
that you had not had a true value for
that, I shou'd not have ask'd your
Friendship; and to shew you that the
favour I wou'd entreat of you is Just, and
Honourable; I only desire you to 
endeavour to deliver this Letter to the hands
of the Charming</font> Philandra. <font>My Lord</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that I will endeavour it,
I do engage my Reputation to your
Lordship, and that within these two hours,
for I am just going to Sir</font> Beetleheads,
<font>to propose a Business that will be of no
little advantage to him; but, that I
shall succeed to your Lordships, and my
own Wishes, I dare not promise</font> . <font>Your
Endeavours are all I ask, Sir</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd
<font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>only this further I could wish,
That you would let me know by 
to morrow this time what success you have had</font> .
<font>Your Lordship shall find me most punctually
and sacredly Obedient in what you have
Commanded me</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said Stepwell.) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I
cannot doubt it, Sir</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd my Lord) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>tho' I am sensible that Honourable Friend
of yours, has justly a greater interest in
<pagebreak id="61" />
you than my self: However, at the same
time, I am assur'd you will oblige me in
this, if he has not already engaged you
to the contrary</font> . <font>Be confident, my Lord,
he has not</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd t'other) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>only I
beseech your Lordship to let me</font> know, <font>if</font>
I may <font>entrust this Paper to any Person,
who I am certain</font> may <font>and</font> will <font>present
it to my Divine Mistress her self</font> ? <font>By
all means, use your own discretion in
that</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (answer'd my Lord) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>for I wholly
rely on your mannagement in this
matter</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Thus, after having again
consecrated their Glasses with the Fair
and Divine Lady's Health, and
<font>Stepwell</font> being well satisfied with the Fifty
Guineas, as <font>Bellamant</font> was of his
Integrity in this Affair; they parted;
my Lord to the Court, and <font>Stepwell
to the Den of a Thief --</font> I don't mean
to Ch-- tho', for all that; for he had
had no business that way of a long
season; but to <font>Gripeley's</font> he went,
whither he got just at Dinner-time.
There he desir'd the 
Coachman-Butler-Porter to present his most
obedient service to Sir <font>Beetlehead</font> ; and
withall, to let his Worship know,
<pagebreak id="62" />
that he had some Business of great
moment to discourse him about,
wherefore he humbly beg'd the honour of
some few minutes Conversation with
him at his earliest leisure. <font>Reins</font>
deliver'd his Complement in the
hearing of <font>Philandra</font> , who from thence
began to conceive some hopes of an
Amorous Intrigue with <font>Worthygrace</font> at
least, or with some body or other by
his means. The Old Jealous Knight
had like to have forgot himself at
first, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> desire him to walk in;
</dialogue><nonSpeech> 'till looking on his Daughter, he
cry'd out aloud in haste,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirrah, desire
him to walk into the outward
Parlour, I will but dispatch a bit or two,
and then I'll come to him. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Stepwell</font>
had not expected above a quarter of
an hour, but <font>Gripely</font> came, and desir'd
him to speak to the Business. <font>Stepwell</font>
then told him, that an honour'd Friend
of his, who had near Six Thousand
Pounds a year, was in a present
necessity of Four Thousand Pounds;
which, if he pleas'd to furnish him
with, the Gentleman his Friend wou'd
Mortgage an Estate to <font>Gripely</font> , which
<pagebreak id="63" />
he had in <font>Gloucester-shire</font> , of Five
Hundred Pounds a year, for his Security.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Well, Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>cry'd the Old
hungry Wolf</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> what is his Name? His
Name I beseech you, and where lies
the rest of his Estate? </dialogue><nonSpeech>To which,
( <font>t'other reply'd</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> his Name, Sir, is
<font>Worthygrace</font> , of the Ancient Family of
the <font>Worthygraces</font> , Originally of
<font>Yorkshire</font> ; tho' the Family has spread it
self into most of the Counties of
<font>England, Scotland</font> , and <font>Wales</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>some of
the other parts of his Estate lay in
such, and such, and such Shires and
Counties; giving him a more
particular account than at present I am
able to make you.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Besides, Sir, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>added he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech your Worship to
take notice, that he is no Swearer,
Whore Master, Drunkard, nor
Gamester. Pish, pish, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the other</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'tis
not a pin matter to you, or me,
whether he be or no; yet (perhaps)
I cou'd wish he were all these: But
since you say he is so fine a Gentleman,
I pray you good Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> how
comes he to have such an urgent
occasion for this Sum, or be obliged to
<pagebreak id="64" />
a Mortgage? Why, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd
Stepwell</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> he is unwilling to expose his
necessity to any of his Acquaintance,
because (possibly) he designs to
marry one of their Daughters, wherefore
he entreated me to assist him in this
matter, since I have no knowledge of
any of his Relations, or Country
Acquaintance, more than your Worship
has. Ay, but Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>interrupted
Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you must give me leave Mr.
<font>Stepwell</font> , you must give me leave to be
better acquainted with him, and his
Concerns, before I part with such a
Sum of mony to him; for it is my
custom so to do, it is indeed, Mr.
<font>Stepwell --</font> Tho' I suppose
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>proceeded he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> this mony is to carry on his
Design on the Lady. It is so, Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>answer'd the other</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and he desires by
all means, that you wou'd give your 
self the satisfaction of enquiring into
the Circumstances of his Estate, but
at a distance, and with all possible
caution, lest his Reputation shou'd
any way suffer. You may have a
sufficient Character of him, and certain
Information of the posture of his
<pagebreak id="65" />
Affairs in <font>York-shire, Gloucester-shire</font> , and
<font>Hertford shire</font> , from any of the
Worthy Gentlemen of those Counties.
No, Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall not
need I believe to give my self any
great trouble in this matter, if this be
the Rich <font>Worthygrace</font> of <font>York-shire</font> .
The very same, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said Stepwell</font> .) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
That's enough </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Reply'd Gripeley</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but
tell me, Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> , is he already
engag'd to this Lady? Is she a <font>Beauty</font> ?
Is she a <font>Wit</font> ? Or, what is chiefly to
be consider'd, is she a Fortune? Sir,
she's worth some 15 or 16000 <font>l.</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Reply'd he</font> .) </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's but a small Portion
for so great an Estate as this </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd
Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and, if he be not already <font>too
far Engag'd</font> , I believe I can
recommend him to a young handsome Lass,
worth at least Thirty Thousand Pounds.
On my word, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said Stepwell</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that
wou'd be an extraordinary favour
indeed, and I fancy he has not made his
approach so close to her, but he can
make an honourable retreat when he
pleases. When may I see him then?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>ask'd the Old Knight</font> .) </nonSpeech><dialogue> To morrow
morning, if you please </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd t'other</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<pagebreak id="66" />
in the mean time, I will prepare him
to receive your kindness with the
greater readiness, for (possibly) he
will do something this Night, in
order to his disengagement from the
Lady he is now in pursuit of. Do so
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said Old</font> Gripely) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and let me see you
both here to morrow at Eleven
precisely. I shall, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Return'd</font>
Stepwell) and took his leave.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>When he left Old Dry-bones, he
went immediately to <font>Worthygrace</font> ,
whom he found at his Lodgings in
<font>Bloomsbury-Square</font> , wher he repeated
every particular of his Discourse with
<font>Gripely</font> , to his honour'd Friend.
Telling him withall, that it cou'd be no
body else but <font>Philandra</font> , whom her
Father intended to propose for a Wife
to <font>Worthygrace</font> ; who was enclineable
enough to believe it; and Rewarded
the Care and Cunning he had shewn in 
the management of his Interest, with
a Diamond Ring from off his finger,
worth 40 <font>l.</font> which t'other receiv'd
with as good a grace as any 
Coupe`-Merchant in Town cou'd do.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> your Present is of much
<pagebreak id="67" />
greater value than the Gold or Stone
cou'd make it, forc'd from embracing
your finger to adorn mine; which
shall be no longer part of my hand,
than it is able to serve you. </dialogue><nonSpeech>then
<font>Stepwell</font> presented him with the Lord
<font>Bellamant's</font> Letter to <font>Philandra</font> ;
acquainting him with the promise he had
made my Lord, to deliver it to her
own hands, or to some other Person
who should assuredly do it; nor did
he conceal the 50 Guineas he received
from <font>Bellamant</font> . <font>Worthygrace</font> was a
little surpriz'd at that Letter, and at
<font>Stepwell's</font> Relation of their
Rencounter; and, tho' he had <font>almost</font> a
<font>Womans Curiosity</font> to see what it contain'd,
yet he had too much honour to
gratify that foolish itch of its humour;
and taking the Letter from <font>Stepwell</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You shall be as good as your word
to my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for I will
present it to her my self, tho' never so
much to my disadvantage. I mean, if
I have the happiness to see her to
morrow. You will not, I hope </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>cry'd
Mai`tre de Dance</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> be so far far
accessary to your own ruine there, as to
<pagebreak id="68" />
attempt it. Pardon me, my Friend,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but I will. I
beseech you then </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Stepwell</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> read
it first, Sir. Not for the purchase of
my happiness in <font>her</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd this
Honourable Lover</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cou'd then never
hope it, because I'm sure I shou'd not
<font>deserve</font> it. No, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
inviolate as it is, and teeming with all the
most Beautiful and Charming Ideas,
and Expressions of his passion that it
may be; she shall receive it from my
hand the very first opportunity have
to offer it to her. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Saying so, he
wrap'd it up in a clean sheet of Paper,
and put it into his Scritore. At which
( <font>cry'd</font> Stepwell) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forgive me, Sir, I
beseech you, if I think this the
oddest method of making Love for a
Mans own self, that I ever yet have
heard of. Call it <font>Knight-Errantry</font> if
thou wilt </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd</font> Worthygrace) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but
I have my satisfaction in it. -- 
Enough of this -- To morrow by Ten
in the morning, I expect you here. I
shall then pay my duty to you, Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Stepwell</font> ) and left him to give
orders for the morrows Expedition;
<pagebreak id="69" />
which he took care should be as
splendid as that little time would
permit.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At Ten the next morning <font>Stepwell</font>
waited on him at his Lodgings, and
soon after they made for Sir
<font>Beetlehead's</font> ; who, the preceeding Night
told his Daughter, that now he hop'd
he had provided her a Husband whom
she could no way except against:</nonSpeech><dialogue> For
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have enquir'd of him of
several Worthy Gentlemen, and
Eminent Citizens, who all give me a most
extraordinary Character of his Person,
and Humour; and which is <font>above all</font> ,
of his Estate, being worth near Six
Thousand pounds <font>per Annum</font> . And
now (my dear Girl) I prithee do not
stand in thine own light: No force,
( <font>Good Sir</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>said she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and I will stretch
my Inclinations as far as may be, to
embrace one of your choice, that I
may recommend my duty to you.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he order'd her to appear as Gay
and Glorious as she cou'd, to receive
him the next morning. Near a 
quarter before Eleven, <font>Worthygrace</font> got to
Old <font>Gripely's</font> , who entertain'd him very
<pagebreak id="70" />
Courteously, and Generously; calling
for a <font>whole</font> Bottle of Canary, which
he himself lov'd best, to drink to him.
After which, the Devil's Casheer, old
<font>Gripely</font> (who only got and dispos'd
of his mony in the Devil's name, and
for his use) fell upon the Business,
and propos'd his Daughter to
<font>Worthygrace</font> , with Thirty Thousand Pounds.
Who told him, that the Overture was
so much above his Merits and
Expectation, that he fear'd he did but
motion such great advantages on
purpose to evade doing him that smaller
obligation which he had entreated of
him by Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor can I have
reason, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> to think
otherwise, since I am yet absolutely a
stranger to you. I confess, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd
<font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you was a <font>Stranger</font> to me 'till
now; but your Circumstances, I am,
and have been before so well satisfied
with, that I shall think both my self,
and Daughter most happy, if you will
accept her for your Wife. But it is
not fair to oblige you to a promise of
that, before you have seen her;
wherefore you shall each of you have
<pagebreak id="71" />
the satisfaction at the same time. We'll
wait on you presently </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>added he</font> ) and
went to fetch her.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
<font>Stepwell</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> will you take my word
another time? Did not I say 'twas his
Daughter, my Divine Mistress
<font>Philandra</font> , whom he wou'd propose to
you? Ay, <font>Philandra's</font> the Charm;
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> his Daughter, and
Thirty Thousand Pounds were
otherwise but dull musick, but indifferent
sounds to me: <font>Philandra</font> ! That
<font>Philandra</font> whom I first saw at the
Boarding-School, whom I love! -- No matter
whose Daughter, or what
Fortune she is, so she may be my Wife.
'Tis the very same, Sir, I dare assure
you </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Coupe`</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then for my Lord's
Letter </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! I have
it with me, I find. </dialogue><nonSpeech>After some little
further Discourse, <font>Gripely</font> led in the
self same <font>Philandra</font> to 'em,
accompany'd with her Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you, this is my
Daughter, as my Lady-Wife tells me,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (and that was well put in) </nonSpeech><dialogue> tell me
how you like her, (pray?) Hah! you
stand as if you were frighted at the
<pagebreak id="72" />
sight of her. I am amaz'd, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd
<font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> at so much Beauty; and
I beg the Lady will pardon the
astonishment, of which she is the Cause.
I protest that was spoken like your
self, Mr. <font>Worthygrace</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the Old
Fool</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> like a fine Gentleman, and a
Courtier: Nay, nay, I love to hear
these Complements in an honest
way -- Perhaps 'tis not the Court
fashion to kiss, or (it may be) you
are asham'd to do it before my face,
therefore I'll be gone, and leave my
Lady-Wife, and Daughter <font>with you</font> .
No (Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare
do it in the face of <font>Majesty</font> , of
Heaven it self, since my thoughts are Just
and Honourable. And I am sorry,
Sir, I gave you the occasion of
instructing my duty. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Saying so, he
Saluted both the Lady-Mother, and
Daughter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Uds precious </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>cry'd the
Old Daddy</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> this puts me in mind of my
wooing my Lady-Wife there; which I
cannot remember without tears of joy:
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (And then (I think) he squeez'd as
much moisture out of his eyes, as
might have made the tittle o're an j,
<pagebreak id="73" />
had it been Ink.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continued he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I'll leave you together, and shall expect
to find you and Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> at dinner
with me here to day. I have a little
business -- a little business, your
Servant, Sir -- Daughter </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>pursu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
this is the man for my money. </dialogue><nonSpeech>With 
that (clapping <font>Worthygrace</font> on the
shoulder, and going out) he eas'd 'em
of a great deal of impertinence.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I
hope, Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the Lady-Mother</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you'll
pardon the infirmities of Old Age.
And the defects of an Old Citizen's
Education </dialogue><nonSpeech> (added <font>Philandra</font> ) .</nonSpeech><dialogue> It looks
hearty and kind, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd
<font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and I cou'd wish,
Madam, you wou'd receive me with as
true a wellcome. Assure your self, Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> a Person of your
merits can't want a due reception. We
plead no merits from Heaven </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd
he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but (Madam) if self-denyal, and
other the greatest mortifications be
any way grateful, I am in hopes that
this Present from me may give you a
testimony of some of my weak
Endeavours that way.</dialogue><nonSpeech>And then he gave her
the Lord <font>Bellamant's</font> Letter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> At last,
<pagebreak id="74" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (added he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perswade my self I shall
not fail of a welcome for his sake that
sent it. </dialogue><nonSpeech>She immediately knew the
hand, and blush'd to receive it from
<font>Worthygrace</font> . But recollecting her self,
( <font>said she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> this I guess is some new
piece of Gallantry from the Lord
<font>Bellamant</font> ; which, howsoever, shall not
rob me of the honour and satisfaction
of your Conversation, Gentlemen.
Nay, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Stepwell</font> , who all
this while had been entertaining the
Lady <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> we are but two to two,
and, for my part, I decline any sort
of dispute with your Ladyship. I
beseech you, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
rob not your self of the pleasure that
Paper may afford you, for my sake.
For assure your self, I had rather suffer
all the anguish of despair and jealousie,
that you shou'd want the least
satisfaction. Pardon me, Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
this will serve to entertain me, when
I want the advantage of better
Company. Then, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you
must arm your self to receive a
discourse of much the same nature, I
fancy, with what that happy paper
<pagebreak id="75" />
contains; which will (undoubtedly) be
more troublesome to you, coming from
me -- I love you, Madam 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>pursu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> with such a passionate
sincerity, that I fear I cou'd <font>almost</font> part
with you to my Rival; if it might
advance your happiness -- say, Madam,
have you <font>decree'd</font> that I shall eternally
be miserable in your indifference; and
have you <font>determin'd</font> that I must quit
my pretensions to my happy Rival?
Blast, Madam, blast all my hopes with
one cruel and irrevocable word, and
let me dye by your Thunder. If, Sir,
on me depends your happiness, or
misery, be confident I wish you the <font>First</font> :
And in a greater measure, than I can
possibly create it to you. This indeed,
Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> is an
obliging manner of <font>Condemning</font> me to the
<font>last</font> , since you exclude me Paradise, and
leave me all the <font>lower</font> World to range
in -- But be assur'd, Madam,
<font>That</font> if all the Beauties of the Universe
were divinely put together into <font>One</font> ,
by their Great Creator; <font>That
stupendious One</font> cou'd not bless me, were it
not, as it is, <font>your own Beauteous self</font> ; who
<pagebreak id="76" />
will not receive me into those joys you
have entirely reserv'd to the Lord
<font>Bellamant</font> . Certainly, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
this Tempest cannot be of long
continuance. This is such a <font>volley of</font> Love
as I <font>never</font> before received. Ah!
Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you <font>rally</font> and <font>play</font> with
my earnest passion -- Forgive me,
if I say this is a little inhumane -- 
But 'tis the effect of your Divinity
that sports it self with my misfortunes.
Doubtless </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> such
another storm o' t'other side from my
Lord, wou'd give me such another
surfeit, that I shou'd swoon at the very
<font>name</font> of <font>Love</font> ever after. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Thus she
evaded giving him any direct answer,
either to make him hope, or despair;
for she thought 'twas convenient to
keep him in play, lest she shou'd miss
of <font>Bellamant</font> . Their Conference lasted
for near two hours, at the end of
which, <font>Old Gripely</font> return'd.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Well,
my new, but worthy acquaintance
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said he to <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> what
progress have you made in your Amours
with my Daughter? Why, Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>answer'd <font>Philandra</font> , (by way of question) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<pagebreak id="77" />
D'you think the Gentleman is us'd to
boast of a Lady's favours? Ah!
Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you have
taken care that I shall have no such
occasion from you -- But I can
suffer. 'Uds precious, Noble Mr.
<font>Worthygrace</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd Old <font>Gripely</font> ,) </nonSpeech><dialogue> suffer me
no suffers, I'll ha' no suffering here,
unless it be, that I suffer you to make
much of my Daughter, and that she do
the same by you -- Come
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continued he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dinner wait's us in t'other
room, and there we'll make much of
our selves. </dialogue><nonSpeech>'Twas about two of the
clock when they sate down, and the
last Course was serv'd in about Four,
(for they had a Miser's Feast) they all
eat heartily, and were as pleasant as
their several Circumstances would
permit 'em.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>In the mean time the Lord <font>Bellamant</font>
having expected <font>Stepwell</font> 'till Three,
who (you know) was otherwise
engag'd, grew impatient, and on a
suddain thought of a design not much
unlike <font>Worthygraces</font> ; commanded his
Coach man to drive him to <font>Gripely's</font> ;
where, just as he got out of his Coach,
<pagebreak id="78" />
he found Sir <font>Blunder</font> enquiring for the
aforesaid Worshipful <font>Cent. per Cent.</font>
The Boobily Knight was strangely
surpriz'd to see my Lord at that place,
and cou'd hardly Salute him, but with
a malicious leer, and awkward bow.
But my Lord knew how to make his
advantage of such an opportunity;
and said to him ( <font>returning the Compliment
of Hat and Cringe</font> ,) that he was
happy to see him there, as well as to hear
that Sir <font>Beetlehead</font> was at home: to
whom, he desir'd Sir <font>Blunder</font> to lead
him the way. The Lubberly Booby
had yet so much of pretended 
Good-manners, as to tell him he knew his
duty better than so, and that it would
be an honour to follow his Lordship.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
No </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd my Lord</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sans Fac`on</font> good
Sir <font>Blunder</font> , you are better acquainted
here than I am, therefore pray take
upon you for once the trouble of my
Guide, and Leader. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So in they went
directly to the latter end of a Feast,
which (perhaps) was the beginning of
a Fray. But had not my Lord arriv'd
just at that moment, when the Servant
told Sir <font>Blunder</font> that <font>Gripely</font> was
<pagebreak id="79" />
within, he had certainly return'd
unedify'd as he came, as to the 
knowledge of his Mistresses Concerns -- </nonSpeech><dialogue>
'Uds precious </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd Sir <font>Beetlehead</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir <font>Blunder</font> , we have wanted you all 
this while to compleat our mirth, but
you are now very wellcome -- Ha,
what fine Gentleman have you brought
to my poor habitation? </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>pursu'd he,
seeing my Lord</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> An humble Servant of
yours, and those fair Ladies
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Worthygrace</font> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>added he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> we are happy to meet here.
Ay, my Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
we are so, in the sight of these fair
Ladies. 'Uds precious, my Lord,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd Old <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> your Lordship is
wellcome, if you don't bring a Pope
in your Belly. No, Sir <font>Beetlehead</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but I brought an
Angel in my heart, I mean your
Daughter, Sir, who fills it with all
the Ideas of Beauty that Humanity is
capable of conceiving, and much more
than it can express. 'Uds precious,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>cry'd the Old man, (a little mellow) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
you are a fine Gentleman, my Lord,
a fine Gentleman indeed; therefore
<pagebreak id="80" />
pray sit down, or you'll tire me with
standing. I do so, Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said my Lord
sitting) </nonSpeech><dialogue> To make you easie, and to
make my self happy, I'll place me just
opposite, and most remote to what I
most love in this World, and to what
you hate I shou'd make any nearer
approaches to. Come, Sir <font>Blunder</font> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> tho' you have been blest in
the enjoyment of the pretty
<font>Marianna</font> ; yet you are almost in the
Circumstances with me, as to the
Beauteous <font>Philandra</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>This he said, putting
<font>Slouch</font> into the next chair to him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My
Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Philandra</font> , who thought it
no more sin to grieve the Spirit of the
zealous Sir <font>Blunder</font> , than he did to lye
with the Maid <font>Marianna</font> ,) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fear your
Lordship forgets that his Worship
has been already so happy in his first
Love, that he need not doubt his
success against another, especially, when
Aided, Abetted, Comforted and
Assisted by a Father's Good, Pious, and
kind Instructions and Intentions;
which yet he could not have
wanted, but for your Lordship's and
this Honourable Gentleman's Address,
<pagebreak id="81" />
and more plentiful Estates. But he
may thank his Stars that there is one
obstacle remov'd, for it seems your
Lordship is a Roman Catholick. And
for my part, Sir <font>Blunder</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (interrupted
<font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am so far from having
receiv'd any particular favour from
this our ador'd Lady, that I must
utterly despair, unless her unparallel'd
and matchless Duty prevail against her
inclinations, and his Lordship's
Merits. Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you
have always the good <font>Fortune</font> and
<font>Intention</font> (it seems) to make me Debtor
to your kind Opinion of me -- wou'd
to Heavens your <font>Wishes</font> were as much
to my advantage. But, Sir <font>Blunder</font> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>pursu'd he, changing the Discourse</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
How does the poor Titt? Has she yet
taken her Degree in <font>Bethlehem</font> , or
<font>Bridewell</font> ? It must be in the first; for
certainly none but a mad thing wou'd
ha' laid a miscarriage upon an 
Alderman's Fellow: It looks as if you had
not been wicked, or able enough to
get a Bastard; when (no doubt) your
<font>Prentice</font> might ha' done you that piece
of service, had you been Marry'd. But
<pagebreak id="82" />
since your Worship is a Batchelor, I
suppose she has been <font>Flawg'd</font> (as they
call it) for putting the Saddle on the
wrong Horse's back -- Ay, my
Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd <font>Slouch</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the Wench
did afterwards confess it was my
Apprentice; for which (as your
Lordship says) she was <font>Flawg'd</font> in good
faith. </dialogue><nonSpeech>At which, they all laugh'd
aloud:</nonSpeech><dialogue> And </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said the Lady <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
this is as happy and full discovery
as any Criminal cou'd make of himself.
You're in the right, my Lady-Wife,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd Old <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'twas a silly
Wench, a silly Wench -- But no
more of that, if you please. No,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must remind my self
of my Friend's business, about which
I now come to sollicit you. There is
a Friend of mine </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that
wants five thousand Guineas, now I
can't spare him above two thousand;
wherefore, if you will oblige him,
Sir, with that Sum, I will <font>Engage</font> , or
<font>Mortgage</font> some port of my Estate for
his payment of it. Why, look you
my Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd <font>Gripely</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> this <font>Engaging</font>
must be <font>Mortgaging</font> , and I don't like
<pagebreak id="83" />
any of your Church-Lands. Hark you
Sir <font>Beetlehead</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I
fancy that among all your Mortgages,
you have one or more of our
Church-Lands; that is, of Papists
Church-Lands, as you stile 'em; and yet I
find there is no great danger of their
infecting you with Popery. But I
mean some of those Lands that my
Lawful Father and Mother left to me
(for perhaps she was an Heiress) those
will I dip unto thee. This requires
farther thought, my Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said he) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
and you shall have your answer to
morrow this time. Nay, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd
<font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if my my business, or my
Friend's be not done by Six in the
Morning, we shall have no further
occassion of yours, or any other
assistance. Six a Clock is early </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd
the Old one) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but I'll see what may be
done, my Lord, after I have discours'd
this Honourable Gentleman: So, my
Lord, I beg your Pardon </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd
he</font> ) taking <font>Worthygrace</font> out o'th' Room
with him, to contrive the hastening
his Match with <font>Philandra</font> . 'Twas then
<font>Bellamant</font> began to shew the violence
<pagebreak id="84" />
of his Love in his Jealousie.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah,
Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he, approaching her, while
the <font>Coupe`-Merchant</font> , and the Booby
Knight diverted the Lady-Mother;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
'tis now high time for me to despair,
since here I found my happy Rival;
seated next to you, and feasting on
your Eyes; happy he is in every
Circumstance, in his Person, in his Sence,
in his Estate, and, no doubt, happy
in your Love. By your Father's
approbation encourag'd, receiv'd by you
with a just opinion of his
extraordinary Qualifications; how long, <font>Heaven</font>
knows, I'm sure I know not -- </dialogue><nonSpeech>This
he spoke somewhat low however, that
they might not hear him; which they
perceiving, were so civil as to
entertain each other with their own
impertinence.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Philandra</font> rising,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I find you are hot, we
must walk. I thank you, Madam,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd he</font> ,) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that you seem at least to
take as much care of me, as my
Grooms do of my Beasts; tho' they
never ran such hot Courses, as I do in
pursuit of you. You flye me, Madam,
now, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continued he</font> ,) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you have shunn'd me
<pagebreak id="85" />
these fourteen or fifteen unaccountable
days; for so they have been to me;
since in all that time I have not once
been blest with the sight of you, 'till
this hour. O Heavens! Madam,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>pursu'd he raving</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> where are all your
vows? where are all your tender
expressions of Love to me? Some indeed
I wear about me, under your Hand
and Seal; and all of 'em where you
have fix'd 'em in my heart. Whence
not you your self can remove 'em, unless
you bid me despair, and dye -- This
is all wondrous fine, indeed my Lord,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and since I find you love
me, even to Jealousie, I'm resolv'd to
give your Lordship farther occasions
of that passion -- And look you,
my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>she continu'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose I
wear about me some of your Lordships
tender expressions of Love in this
Paper; which I receiv'd from your
happy Rival, as you think him: This
he deliver'd to me, un-open'd I dare
believe -- Unopen'd as it is!
</dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted he;</nonSpeech><dialogue> now, by all my hopes
on Earth, which terminate in you,
Madam; my Love is not more sacredly
<pagebreak id="86" />
inviolate, than is this Paper; I know
the Seal, and find 'tis not abus'd -- 
Oh! this is more dreadful to me,
than his pretensions to you, Madam.
And did he give it thus, without a
scoff? Just as you see it, my Lord, and
with respect </dialogue><nonSpeech> (answer'd <font>Philandra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah,
wou'd h'had soften'd the hard faithful
wax, and ravish'd wide the innocent
Contents! I then might justly have
return'd the wrong, and from his breast
have torn a <font>Villain's</font> heart, teeming
with Sacriledge against you -- But
now, now it appears so Gloriously
adorn'd, with your Bright Form in
ev'ry corner of it, that I must fear to
touch it. Oh, that Love shou'd rob
me of so generous a Friend -- I mean,
whom I cou'd wish mine -- Make
him so, </dialogue><nonSpeech>return'd she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall not hinder
such a happy union. Nothing but
you on Earth cou'd do it, Madam,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Bellamant</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> Assure your self I
will not, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Here, my Lord,
take your Letter, I beseech you, and
own the obligation he design'd you --
'twill be a good beginning of your
Friendship -- </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now did this fair
<pagebreak id="87" />
Devil desire nothing less.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- 
No, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>replied he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not
rob you of what <font>He</font> presented to you:
Besides, if ever you had any regard
of my Passion; I cou'd wish, you
wou'd keep it: For, I fear, it is the
last you will ever be troubled with
from me. <font>Troubled I wou'd have you</font> ,
Madam, when you read it; to think
how faithful and how Passionate a
Lover you have thrown away. It
seems my Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Return'd</font> Philandra) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
you are at length grown <font>weary</font> of
feigning a Passion; and wou'd now
perswade me, that I am displeas'd
with your pretended services: But,
assure your self, my Lord, Be it real
or counterfeit; it has already given
me a very pretty entertainment. You
will e're long I doubt not, Madam,
be judge of its truth or falshood. -- 
In the mean time, Madam; enjoy
your self, with the <font>Thoughts</font> of your
new Lover! perhaps they will prove
your only satisfaction. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Philandra</font> did
not know what to make of this last
part of his discourse; and was about
to beg his Lordship to explain
<pagebreak id="88" />
himself, just as her Father re-entred with
<font>Worthygrace</font> . The chatt then was
continu'd among 'em, for upwards of
an hour; the Rivals plying their
Mistress very warmly; who return'd
their Volleys with equal heat: In
which she took accasion to tell
<font>Worthygrace</font> ; that she must have better proofs
of his Love and Service, than a bare
Tongue-Devotion: And, in order to
that, he shou'd wave the advantage he
had in her Father's opinion; and pay
her no more Visits, than he wou'd to
an old, doating Relation of his, who
liv'd most remote to him in Town;
if any such he had. To which
<font>Worthygrace</font> reply'd, that he wou'd obey
her, tho' to the hazard of his Life, and
certain loss of all his quiet.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said my Lord</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if this worthy
Gentleman's Fate be so Rigorous; what
severity has your Ladyship reserv'd for
me! How often, I mean, how seldom
may I be permitted to pay my
Devotion to you in an Age? The seldomer
the better </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Return'd she</font> :) </nonSpeech><dialogue> once more
will satisfie for your whole Life. So,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> this comes of
<pagebreak id="89" />
inquiring into a Man's own destiny. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Some
farther prattle they had; at the end
of which they took their leaves of the
fair Ladys and the two Knights. As
they were going out, my Lord told
<font>Worthygrace</font> , that he had a Curiosity
to shew him at his Lodgings; and
therefore desir'd, that he wou'd give
him the favour of his Company
thither.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Lordship </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
shall Command me in any thing. But
one; </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Interrupted my Lord</font> ,) shewing
<font>Worthygrace</font> into the Coach.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr.
<font>Stepwell</font> your Servant </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font>
Worthygrace) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you had best make use of
my Coach to your own House.
Adieu, Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said Bellamant.)
He humbly made his Obeisance to 'em
both, and Roll'd home in State:
But not without some suspicion of
what might happen betwen 'em.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>There were now no more in the
Coach, than my Lord, and 
<font>Worthygrace</font> ; when my Lord, with a sigh,
began thus to him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- How strangely
does Fortune now at last begin to
treat me! I mean, how severely!
since, 'tis the first most sensible
<pagebreak id="90" />
<comment type="compiler">IN SOURCE TEXT 91</comment>
Affliction that ever touch'd me, to have
<font>you</font> for my Rival. You, <font>Worthygrace</font> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> whom, above all Men
my Soul wou'd chuse for its dearest
Companion in all things; but in a
Mistress. I know the greatness of
your mind; have seen a little of the
sweetness of your Temper; have
receiv'd an obligation from you this
day, in delivering my Letter to
<font>Philandra</font> , seal'd as I sent it, by that
<font>Trifle Stepwell</font> , from whom you had it.
And, after all this, is it not hard,
that I must own to you, I cannot be
happy if you live? At least in your
pretensions to <font>Philandra</font> ! This, my
Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> is
certainly the greatest of my Misfortunes,
since, (give me leave to own this
sacred truth to you!) your Lordship
is the only Person among all Mankind,
with whom I cou'd have contracted a
most Religious Friendship: As, on
the other side, That Charming
Creature, created to our Misery, is she
alone in whom I <font>must</font> be happy, as in
a Wife. O! Pardon me! </dialogue><nonSpeech> (return'd
<font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you must not; while I live:
<pagebreak id="91" />
<comment type="compiler">IN SOURCE TEXT 92</comment>
You must therefore force your
happiness through me; as I will attempt
mine from you. Tho' Heaven knows
with what regret! To morrow, Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall expect you on the
backside of <font>Southampton</font> House. The
Field is near your Lodging, and not
far from mine. Bring with you, two
of your best Friends, as I will of
mine; whom I beseech you to engage to
be no farther Active, than to
endeavour the escape of the survivor. For,
(haply) we may not both fall. Nor
either of us, I cou'd wish </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>return'd</font>
Worthygrace) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but (ah, my Lord!)
these are but wishes. No more </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
<font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but thus I have contriv'd
it, if you please: -- our Chairs shall
wait us at convenient distance; and
our Friends shall prevent the
unseasonable kindness of our Servants.
And now, in the mean time we'll
pray for one another. And, if it be
my Fate to fall by you; Heaven
forgive you, in its sweetest Mercy! And,
if from you ( <font>my Lord</font> ) I meet my
Death; Heav'n grant you happy life,
here and hereafter; </dialogue><nonSpeech>so <font>Worthygrace</font>
<pagebreak id="92" />
return'd; and ask'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> What hour, my
Lord? 'Tis light enough at four
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Bellamant</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> be that the hour: If
'tis befitting your convenience, Sir. I
shall most punctually observe your
Lordships Commands, said <font>Worthygrace</font> , Till
then, let us embrace, and <font>Think</font> , and <font>Act</font>
as Friends, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said my Lord, embracing him</font> )
To which t'other return'd, and sigh'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
ah! wou'd to Heav'n, my Lord, I
might for ever thus clasp you, as my
Soul's Heart!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Having thus assign'd the time and
place, they came at last to <font>Bellamant's</font>
Lodgings; where, after they had
taken a friendly Bottle, <font>Worthygrace</font> left
him, to find and prepare his Friends
against the next Morning; which was
as well <font>Bellamant's</font> business that night.
How soundly they slept I can't say:
But they met exactly together at the
time and place.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Good morrow to
your Lordship, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (cry'd <font>Worthygrace</font> .) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
A happy one to my Dear and Honour'd
Friend, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Return'd my Lord</font> .) </nonSpeech><dialogue> E're we
begin this unfriendly dispute </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd
he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> let me endeavour to make an
acknowledgement and return of the
<pagebreak id="93" />
Obligation you laid on me
yesterday. -- I here declare, before these
Gentlemen, our worthy Friends, that
I am the Aggressour: That I
provok'd you to seek my Life, to defend
your own. I know your
Circumstances with his Majesty are not so
advantageous for you, as I cou'd wish:
I am sensible, you refus'd to serve
him with your interest, for taking off
the Penal Laws and Test. Mine are
quite otherwise: This Letter
therefore, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>pursu'd he</font> , shewing a Letter,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is
superscrib'd <font>To his most Sacred Majesty</font> ,
whom Heav'n bless! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>said the Lord</font>
Bellamant;</nonSpeech><dialogue> this of my Death will
give a just account; as well as of the
manner how I sought it. -- O! this,
my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>this</font> is
<font>unjustly</font> Generous: since 'tis
Rival'd Love that makes us both
contend for the most glorious prize. No
more thy Friend but Rival think me
then! </dialogue><nonSpeech>cry'd <font>Bellamant</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as I will look
on thee; our Swords will else want
points. No <font>more</font> as Friend my Lord?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>ask'd <font>Worthygrace</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> No more, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>t'other
reply'd</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Philandra</font> is the word: </dialogue><nonSpeech>At
<pagebreak id="94" />
<comment type="compiler">IN SOURCE TEXT 95</comment>
which they both drew; and fell to it
<font>heartily</font> . Each was an excellent Master
in that Bloody Science; and long was
the dispute: Many and large Wounds
were dealt on both sides; and the
Effussion of Blood was great on each
part. At last they clos'd; and
struggling, fell both together, with their
Swords and Arms over each others
back: And both endeavour'd to rise,
but neither cou'd: Which their
Friends perceiving, each Party took
his Man and bore him off to his Chair.
But, to give 'em their due, those
Spectators wou'd fain have been
<font>otherwise</font> Active; and had been; had they
not engag'd themselves most
Religiously to the contrary: And it was
happy for the Principals, that they
did not Act in the Bloody part of
this Scene. So with Sighs and Tears
almost gushing from their Eyes, they
took a sorrowful leave of each other:
And, going different ways, they
dipos'd of their Honourable
unfortunate Charges; as <font>they</font> over night
had receiv'd instructions from them.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<pagebreak id="95" />
<comment type="compiler">IN SOURCE TEXT 96</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The two Worthies were soon
wanting to their Friends and
Acquaintance; especially <font>Worthygrace</font> to
<font>Stepwell</font> ; who, as I said before, had
some jealousy of the design.
Whereupon, next day he waited on
<font>Philandra</font> , to know, if she had seen, or
heard from him: Who was a little
surpriz'd, to hear him enquire of his
Friend from <font>her</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> I was going, Mr.
<font>Stepwell</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>said she</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to ask you
concerning his health. His Health, Madam!
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd he in a melancholly tone</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> pray
Heaven, he has his life! What means
this? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>ask'd she</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll say Amen to that
Prayer always. But satisfie me, I
beseech you, why is there a more
particular necessity of it <font>now</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>He then
acquainted her with the Grounds he had
for his Suspicion, that <font>Bellamant</font> and
he had fought.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Avert it Heaven!
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>said she</font> . She had hardly made an end
of this short Petition; e're her
Father and Mother came in trembling.
The first, in a doleful hey (perhaps,
in <font>gam-ut</font> or <font>C-fa-ut</font> flat. In which
most of our famous farewells are set,)
told her, that the Lord <font>Bellamant</font>
<pagebreak id="96" />
had basely Murther'd Noble Mr.
<font>Worthygrace</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> However, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>added he</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'tis
some comfort yet, that he first
dispatch'd that Papist Bully; who else
wou'd ha' Cut his Throat, with Pistols,
Fuzees, Musquet, Blunderbusses, and
all sorts of Fire-Arms. </dialogue><nonSpeech>At this
<font>Stepwell</font> cou'd hardly forbear smiling, for
all this sorrowful account of his
Friend and Patron: But <font>Philandra</font> and
her Mother were almost drown'd in
floods of their own Tears.
However, <font>Philandra</font> , recollecting her self
a little, told her Father, that she cou'd
not believe, <font>Bellamant</font> had <font>basely</font>
Murther'd <font>Worthygrace</font> ; since he himself
was kill'd before.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, Madam,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Stepwell</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> all the World knew
my Lord too Generous to do any
thing below the Character of the
bravest. But, why, Mr. <font>Stepwell</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>said
the Mother</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> since you had but too just
a suspicion of their intention; why
did you not endeavour to prevent 'em
in it? Alas, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>reply'd he</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
nothing but Heaven or the King's
Commands cou'd have hinder'd it. Nor
cou'd the last have <font>long</font> obstructed
<pagebreak id="97" />
their fatal Resolutions. O, most
unfortunate of Womankind! </dialogue><nonSpeech>cry'd out
<font>Philandra</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who will endure to hear
my hated name? Since, for <font>my</font> sake
two such brave Men are lost. My dear
Daughter, and only Child </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the
old Man</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> do not grieve so
immoderately! Sir <font>Blunder</font> is yet alive, who
will make a better Husband for <font>thee</font>
than either of 'em; and him, I resolve
thou shalt marry to morrow; or I
profess, thou sha't not inherit one
hundred pence of my Estate.
