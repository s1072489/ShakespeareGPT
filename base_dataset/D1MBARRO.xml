<comment type="compiler">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS OMITTED.</comment>
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Arch B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Barrowe / is your name Barrowe?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is told me / that yow refuse to receiue or obey our 
letter / know yow what yow doe? it is from the high commissioners / 
and this man a pursuvant.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I refused to receive or obey that letter at that time.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I was vnder arrest / and imprisoned without warrant /
and against law: and there fore now it was too late to bring the
letter.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why / may not a Counsellor commit to prison by his bare
commandement? </dialogue><nonSpeech> (alledging how the Aldermen of London doe daily.) </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is not the question / what a counsellor may doe: but
whither this man may doe it without warrant / by the law of the land:
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (pointing to the keeper of the Clinke.) </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Know yow the law of the land?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Very litle / yet was I of Grayes Inne some yeares. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Then his
two Doctours and he / derided mine vnskilfulnes.) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let this passe: I
look for litle help by
<pagebreak id="A2V" />
law against yow: I pray yow why haue yow imprisoned me / and after 
this manner sent for me?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That yow shal know vpon yowr oath: wil yow sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I hold it lawful to sweare / so it be done with due order and
circumstances. 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Reach a book / hold it him.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What shal we doe with this?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Lay your hand vpon it man.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To what purpose?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To sweare.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I Vse to sweare by no bookes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow shal not sweare by the book / but by God onely.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So I purpose when I sweare.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Cus.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did yow neuer take an oath at an Assise before the Iudges
there?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Cus.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But would yow refuse there to lay yowr hand on a book and
sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then would your testimonie not be taken.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why man the book is no part of the oath / it is but a
cerimonie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A needlesse and wicked ceremonie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why know yow what yow say? know yow what book it is? it is the
Bible.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I wil sweare by no Bible.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Scismaticks are clamorous alwayes. it is a perpetual note
to know them by.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Dr. Cussins saith true / such were the Donatistes alwayes
in the counsels / and such art thow and al other scismatiks such as 
thow art.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Say yowr pleasure / God forgiue yow: I am neither scismatike
nor clamourous: I answer but yowr demandes / if yow wil I wil be
silent.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel wil yow lay your hand on the Bible and take an oath.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I vse to ioyne no creatures to the name of God in an oath.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Neither shal yow / this is but a custome commanded by law.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The law ought not to commannd a wicked custome.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why / is it not lawful to lay your hand on a book?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes / but not in an oath.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wil yow lay your hand in my hand, and sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wil yow lay your hand on y=e= table and sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wil yow hold your hand towards heauen and sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is not amisse: but I wil use my libertie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why yow hold it lawful to lay your hand on the table and
sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, so it be not commanded and made of necessitie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, the booke is y=s= like: it is nothing of the oath but
a thing indifferent.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If it be nothing of the othe / why doe yow so peremptorilie
inioyne it? and if it be indifferent as yow say it is / then doe I wel
in not vsing it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay / yow doe not wel in refusing it / for therin yow shew
yowr self disobedient to the higher powers set over yow by God.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Euen now yow said it was a thing indifferent: if it be so /
ther is no power can bring me in bondage to my libertie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Where finde yow that?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In S Paul. 1. Cor. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Arch B. Archd.</font> Dr. Cussins / al 
denied it. I affirmed it. a litle testament in greek and latine was 
brought me / and a Bible I looked for <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: foe</comment> the place 
but could not finde it: great fault was in my memorie / ffor I looked 
in the 10. chapter / neither in deed could I bethinke me where to 
finde it / they so interrupted me.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="A3R" />
<nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Your devinitie is like yowr law.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The word of God is not the worse for my il memorie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow speak not as yow thinck / for yow are prowd.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue smal cause to be prowd of my memorie / yow see y=e=
default of it: but the Apostle saith it. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Againe they al denyed
it.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow then haue no cause to condemne my memorie / seing yow al 
haue vtterly forgotten this sayeng. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then repeated I the words: Al
thinges are lawful for me / but I wil not be brought in bondage to my
libertie. Then they recited. Rom. 14. and 1. Corint. 8. al thinges are
lawful for me / but al thinges are not expedient. I said I meant not
that place.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I would like it wel if yow cited your place in Greek or
Latine.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why yow vnderstand English: is not the word of God in English?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Cussin began to speak of <foreign>indefinita propositio</foreign> , but
whervpon I can not cal to remembranc: i <comment type="compiler">SO IN SOURCE TEXT 
AT LINE BREAK</comment> I told him we were now about the new Testament / 
it might be if he had asked me that question when I knew him in 
Cambridge / I should then haue answered him he forthwith called to 
remembrance of what howse I was.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were yow then of Cambridge?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea / I knew yow there. </dialogue><nonSpeech>He said he was there before I was
borne. I said it might be. Then he entred into discourse of his 
antiquitie. Then he asked me if I had read books / as Calvin / Beza 
etc. I answered that I had read more then ynough: But yet I know not
why I am emprisoned.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is reported that yow come not to church / are disobedeent to
her maiestie / and say that ther is not a true church in England / 
what say yow / haue yow at any time said thus?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> These are reportes. when yow produce yowr testimonie 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: testtmonie</comment> I wil answer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But I wil better beleeue yow / upon yowr oath / then them: how
say yow / wil yow sweare?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I wil know what I sweare to / before I sweare.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> ffirst sweare: and then if any thing be vnlawfully demaunded /
yow shal not answer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue not learned so to sweare / I wil first know and consider
of the matter before I take an oath. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Thus many thinges being 
alleaged to and fro by vs, the Arch B. commaunded Cussin to recorde / 
that I refused to sweare vpon a book.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> yea / and set downe also / that I wil not sweare thus at random 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: randon</comment> / but first I wil know and consider of the 
thinges I sweare vnto / whither they require an oath.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel / when were yow at church?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is nothing to yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow are a scismatick / a recusant / a seditious person / </dialogue><nonSpeech>etc.
with many such like.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Say what yow list of me / I freelie forgiue yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I care not for yowr forgiuenes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But if yow offend me / yow ought to seek it / while yow are in
the way with me.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When were yow at church?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue answered that in an other place / it belongeth not to
yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why / are yow indited?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet belongeth it to vs <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: ys</comment> . I wil not onely 
medle with yow / but arraigne yow as an heretick before me.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow
<pagebreak id="A3V" />
shal doe no more then God wil: Erre I may / but hereticke wil I never
be.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wil yow come to church hereafter?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> ffuture thinges are in the Lords handes: if I doe not / yow
haue a law.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue yow spoken these wordes of the church of England?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When yow produce your witnesse I wil answer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But vpon your oath I wil beleeue yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But I wil not accuse my self. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then began he againe to charge
me with scisme / sedition / heresie.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow are lawlesse: I had rather yow produced yowr witnesse.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Of what occupation are yow?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A christian.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So are we al.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I deny that.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But are yow a minister?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A scholemaister?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What then / of no trade of life?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In your letter / yow know my trade in the superscription.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow are then a gentleman.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> After the manner of our conntrie a gentleman.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Serue yow any man?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No I am Gods freeman.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel can yow finde sufficient suretie for your good behaviour?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea / as sufficient as yow can take.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What / yow cannot haue the Queene?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Neither can yow take her / she is the iudge of her law: yet for
my good behauiour / I suppose I could get her word.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doth she know yow then?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know her.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Els were it pitie of your life.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Can yow haue any of these that came with yow / to be bound for
yow?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not / I thinke I can.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What know yow them not?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know one of them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What is he?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A gentleman of Graies ynne.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What cal yow him?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Lacie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But know yow what band yow should enter / yow are bound hereby
to frequent our churches.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I vnderstand yow of my good behauiour.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And in it is this conteyned: and so yow had forfeyted your
bond at the first.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel now I know yowr minde / I wil enter no such bande.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I wil send yow to prison. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then called he Watson the
pursuva~t / and D. Cussins a part into a windowe / where he made a
warrant to send me to prison.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow shal not touch one haire of my head / without the wil of my
heauenly father.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I wil doe this to rectifie yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Consider what yow doe / yow shal one day answer it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow wil not sweare: yow wil not enter bond for your 
appearance <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: appcarance</comment> .

imprisonment.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay / that wil not serue the turne / Mr. Doctor / enter these
thinges. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Cussins wrote that I refused to sweare / and enter

</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue not learned to sweare by any creatures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Cant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the word of God / the Bible.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B. I began to open the book / and meant in deed to haue asked him / 
if the Apocrypha scripture / and notes which were in it / were the 
word of God: but Cant. belike suspecting some such matter would not
suffer me to look into it / to whom then I answered that that booke 
was not the eternal Word of God / that eternal God himselfe / by whom
onely I must sweare / and not by any bookes or Bibles.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>Cant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So yow shal sweare by God.

answer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Cant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Set downe that he wil not sweare.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. C. Iustice.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow shal onely sweare to answer the truth: if 
any vnlawful thing be demaunded of yow / yow need not answere.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord / euery truth requireth not an oath / ther must great
regard and reuerence be vsed in an oath / and an oath for
confirmation ought to be the ende of al strife: My Lo. if I should
erre / and deliuer it vpon mine oath for truth / it were a double
sinne / likewise if I should eyther not know / not remember / or not

</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And so the holy Ghost calleth it in the 1. of the Reuelation.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Lond.</nonSpeech><dialogue> We haue nothing in our saintes dayes / but that which is
taken forth of the Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In that yow say true / for yow finde no Saintes dayes in the

</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But not their dayes and festiuals in the Scripture. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The
Lo. Buckh. then said / I was a proud spirit. The L. Treas. said I had
a hotte braine: and taking into his hande a book of common prayer /
which lay on the boord / read certaine of the collectes for the
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
Saintes / and shewed that the Epistles and Gospels were part of the
Scripture: and asked me what I could mislike therin?</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I mislike al / for we ought not so to vse Scriptures or 
prayers.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Lond.</nonSpeech><dialogue> May we not make commemoration of the saintes liues in the
church.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not after yowr manner / to giue peculier dayes / eues / 
fastes / worship / feastes vnto them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But what is there jdolatrous?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Al / for we ought not so to vse the Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Lond.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What not in commemoration of the Saintes?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> As I haue said / not after yowr manner.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But what is euil here?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> All my Lo. for by abusing the Scripture we may make it an
jdol The circumstances make euil thinges / of themselues good / as in
the massebook from whence this stuffe is fetched there are sundry 
good collectes and places of scripture / which their superstitious 
abuse make abhominable and euil. Likewise coniurers make many good 
prayers which the circumstances also make euil. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Here the Lo. Buckh. 
said I was out of my wittes.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lo. I speak the wordes of sobernes and truth / as I 
could make plaine if I might be suffered.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Here we pray / that our liues may be such as theirs was
void of couetousnes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So ought we to doe / and not to reade or haue any parte of the
scripture without fruite / and to follow and flee that which we finde
praised and discommended in them: yet ought we not to vse the
scriptures in this manner to dayes and times / neither to be thus
restreyned or stinted in our prayers / as to be tied to this forme of
wordes / place / time / manner / kneele / stand etc.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Buckh.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This fellow delighteth to heare himselfe speake.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (The L. Chanc. also spake some what at that time / which I cannot
cal to remembrance as yet) Then the Arch B. also spake many thinges
against me / of smal effect / which I haue also forgotten / onely this 
I remember he said / I was a strower of errors / and that therfore he
committed me.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In deed yow committed me halfe a yeare close prisoner in the
Gatehowse / and I neuer vntil now vnderstood the cause why / neither
as yet know I what errors they be / shew them therfore I pray yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>The L. Buckh. againe said I was a presumtuous spirit.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lo. al spirits must be tried and iudged by the word of
God: but if I erre my Lo. it is meet I should be shewed wherin.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Chanc.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ther must be streighter lawes made for such fellowes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Would to God ther were my Lo. our iourny should be the shorter.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yow complained to vs of iniustice / wherin haue yow wrong?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lo. in that we are thus imprisoned without due trial.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why / yow said yow were condemned vpon the statute.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Vniustly / my Lo. that statute was not made for vs.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ther must be streighter lawes made for yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> O my Lo. speak more comfortablie / we haue sorrowes ynough.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Tr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In deed thow lookest as if thow hadst a troubled
conscience.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No I praise God for
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
it: but it is a woeful thing that our Princes sworde should thus be
drawen against her faithful subiectes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>The L. Tr. answered that the Queenes sword was not as yet drawen
against vs. Then in a word or two I complayning of the misery and
lingring close imprisonment which we suffer: the L. Tr: demaunded if
we had had no conference. The B. of Lond. answered that sundrie had
bene with vs as D. Some / Grauiat and others / but we mocked them that
came vnto vs.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is not true / the Lord knoweth: we mock no creature.
Neither doe I know / or haue euer seene / to my remembrance / that
Grauiat yow speak of. But miserable phisitians are yow al / for Mr.
Some he indeed was with me / but neuer would enter disputation: he
said / he came not therefore / but in reasoning manner to know some 
what of my minde more cleerly. <omission type="line" />

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Lond.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Presbyter is latine for a preist.

which the greek word doth / which is an Elder.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What is your name?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> John. Grenewood.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Lay yowr hand vpen the book / yow must take an oath.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I wil sweare by the name of God if ther be any need / but not
by or vpon a book.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> We wil then examine yow without an oath. Are yow a minister?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / I was one after your orders.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who disgraded yow?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I disgraded my self through Gods mercy by repentance.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (then after many wordes / they brought forth a paper conteyning
certaine articles in manner of questions as foloweth) </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it lawful to vse the Lordes prayer publickly or privatly as
a prayer / or no?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a doctrine to direct al our prayers by: but seing it
conteyneth the doctrine of the holy Scripture / no man can vse the
same as a private or publick prayer / because he hath not present
need to aske al the peticions therin conteyned / at one time: neither
can comprehend them with feeling and faith.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it lawful or no? I wil heare no pratling.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is not lawful for any thing I can see by the Scripture / for
ther is no commaundement to say the very wordes ouer: and Christ and
his Apostles prayed in other wordes according to their present
necessitie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it lawful to vse any stinted prayers either publickly or
privatly in prayer?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> They are Apocrypha / and may not be vsed in the publick
assemblie: the word / and the graces of Gods spirit / are onely to be
vsed there.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Answer directly / is it lawful to vse them publickly or
privatly?
<pagebreak id="C2R" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Paul saith in Rom. 8. the spirit of God maketh request for
vs / and that we know not what to aske / but the spirit helpeth our
infirmities
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Answer directly.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is not lawful to vse stinted prayers invented by man /
either publickly or privatly for any thing I can see by the
Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What say yow then to the book of common prayer / is it
superstitious popish and jdolatrous / yea or no?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech yow that I may not be vrged by your law: I haue
thus long bene close prisoner / and therfore desire yow to shew me
wherfore / and not now to entangle me by your law.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it not yowr law now as wel as ours: it is the Queenes law:
Yow are a good subiect.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am obedient as a true subiect. But I took it we had
reasoned of your popish canons.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not the common prayer booke / established by the Queenes
law?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. Cheif Iust.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Tel vs what yow thinke of the book of common
prayer / yow shal haue libertie to cal back what yow wil againe.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If it were in free conference / as it hath bene often desired
by vs I would so doe.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Winch.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue yow not vsed these wordes a yeare a goe / that it
was popish superstitious and idolatrous?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes I thinck I haue: for it was taken out of the Popes
portuis.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why would yow not answer so before?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I see yow goe about to bring me within the compasse
of the law.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>I. Anderson.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What say yow now to it?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That ther ar many errors in it / and the forme therof is
disagreeable to the Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Arch B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it contrary to the Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It must needs be contrary if it be disagreable.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Winch.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whither hold yow it idolatrous / superstitious and popish?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue answered what I thinke of it: I hold it ful of errors /
and the forme therof disagreable to the Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What say yow for mariage: did not yow marie one Boman and his
wife / in the Fleet?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / neither is mariage a part of the ministers office.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did vse prayer?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke / I did at that time vse prayer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who ioyned their handes togither?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know no such thing / they did publickly acknowledge their
consent before the assemblie.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Stanup.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I wil make them doe penance for it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ther be some had more need shew open repe~tance then they.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> They may make such mariages vnder a hedge / and it hath bene a 
long receiued order to be maried by the minister.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / ther were many faithful witnesses of their consentes:
and if it were not lawful / we haue many examples of the ancient
fathers / who by your iudgement did amisse.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What say yow to the church of England / is it a true
established church of God?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The whole common wealth is not a church.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>J. Anders.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But doe yow know any true established church in the
land?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If I did / I would not accuse them vnto yow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But what say yow / is not the whole land as it standeth now
ordered / a true established church?

yow / I

</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. C. Iust.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / yow shal haue ynough hereafter to shew the

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What doe yow say to the church of England as it is now guided
by Bbs. is it Antichristian?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> By such Bs. and lawes as it is now guided / it is not
according to the Scriptures.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Winch.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Thow hast Scriptures often in thy mouth: is it then
Antichristian.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea / I hold it contrarie to Christes word.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What say yow to the Sacramentes then / are they true
Sacramentes?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / they are neither rightly administred according to Christes
institution / neither haue promise of grace / because yow keep not the
covenant.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak plainly / are they true Sacramentes or no?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / if yow haue no true church yow can haue no true
Sacramentes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How say yow / are we baptised?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea / yow haue the outward signe which is the washing / but no
true Sacrament.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How can that be?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Very wel. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (then I thought to haue shewed reasons / but I
could not be suffred.) </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it lawful Baptisme?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Need we then to be baptised againe if we had that ministerie
and gouerment yow speak of?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Should we be baptised at al?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea / or els if we contemne it / we deny the profession of
grace.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If al the people were faithful / hauing Gods law and ordnances
practised amongst them / I doe.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then yow hold that the parish / doe not make it the church?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No / but the profession which the people make.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe yow hold that the church ought to be governed by a
Presbyterie?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, euery congregation of Christ ought to be gouerned by
that Presbyterie which Christ hath appointed.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What are those officers?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pastor / Teacher / Elder / etc.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And by no other?

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> May this people and presbyterie reforme such thinges as be
amisse / without the Prince?

censure of the word.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What if the Prince forbid them?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> They must doe that which God commaundeth neuerthelesse.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Prince doe offende / whither may the presbyterie
excommunicate the Prince or no?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The whole <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wole</comment> church may excommunicate any 
member of that congregation / if the partie continue obstinate in open 
transgression.
<pagebreak id="C3R" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whither may the Prince be excommunicate?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ther is no exception of person: and I doubt not but her

word of God which bindeth and looseth sinne.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whither may the Prince make lawes in the gouerment of the
