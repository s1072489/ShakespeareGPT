<nonSpeech>After the reading of the Indictment,
being ask'd by the Clerk of the Crown,
If he were Guilty or Not Guilty? He
answer'd to this effect; being
admonish'd to speak higher, whereunto he
excus'd himself by the Lowness of his Voice.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am here indicted of divers Points of
High-Treason, part whereof I deny, for that I
was never privy to the same: My Fact, such as
<pagebreak id="117C2" />
it is, I am ready to confess, and declare as I have
already confess'd it. I am not learned in the
Law, I know not in what Form to answer unto
it. This only I require to be heard to declare the
Truth, so far as the Matter toucheth me: I here
protest before your Honours, and in the Presence
of God, that I bring a Conscience untouch'd
with any intent of hurt, ever conceiv'd by me
against the Queen's Majesty's Person, or my
<pagebreak id="118C1" />
Country; I never meant any such thing in my Heart;
I know the Law hath not Intent to the Conscience,
or Intent of Men; but is to judge only of the
Mind, according to the appearing of outward
Facts: so the Law cannot accept my Intent for
my Purgation. Therefore I shall declare the
Truth of my Doing, and upon that further open
unto you at large my Dealing in the Matters
contain'd in the Indictment. First, For the Matter of
moving of Sedition, I did never know that any
such thing was meant by my Lord, or any other;
and whatsoever was by him, or any other intended,
I was not privy unto it. I do confess indeed,
that the Articles mention'd in the Indictment were
sent to my Lord, my late Master, which by his
Commandment I decypher'd, for they were
brought in Cypher. Then my Lord read them,
and folded them up, and put them in the Pocket
of his Hose, and said, The Bishop of <font>Rosse</font> will
never be quiet, and then he went to Supper; and
from that time I never saw that Writing till it was
shew'd me in the <font>Tower</font> . What Answer my Lord
made to them, or whether he answer'd them or
no, I know not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.J. <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hickford</font> , you seem to be a Man of
Knowledge and Learning, you have been indicted,
and are now arraign'd according to Order of Law;
you must follow Order, you must answer to the
Indictment, confess or deny it, you shall be heard
after to say your Mind. You must plead unto it
Guilty or not Guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do confess the Law hath no respect
to Man's Intent, but judgeth according to his
Fact. I confess I saw these Articles and
decypher'd them, I shew'd them to my Lord; I
revok'd them not, as in Duty I ought to have done,
and therefore I think my self Guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Indictment containeth divers
Clauses of Treason, therefore answer, if you be
guilty, to any special Matters contain'd in the
Indictment, or that you will confess your self Guilty of
the whole.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I may not confess of my self that
whereof my Conscience doth not accuse me, some
Parts I am not privy to; the first Point, 
concerning stirring of Sedition, I do not know that ever
any such thing was meant by my Lord. What
Intention he had, God and his own Conscience
knoweth it. As touching the Matter of <font>Rodolph's</font>
going over to the King of <font>Spain</font> , to the Pope,
and the Duke of <font>Alva</font> , and the Instructions of
that Voyage contain'd in the thing, that by my
Lord's Commandment I decypher'd: I answer, as
I have before said, that I never knew of any
Proceeding, nor dealt therein afterwards; and my
Lord, when he read it decypher'd, he answer'd as
I said before, The Bishop of <font>Rosse</font> will never be
quiet. I thought he had burnt that Paper, as a
thing that he lik'd not; but what he did with it,
or in the Matter afterward, I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must answer more roundly and
directly to the Matter; for these Circumstances and
Points, you shall be heard afterward. In the mean
time answer plainly, if you be Guilty or not
Guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Southcote.</font> Mr. <font>Southcote</font> spake to the same effect,
and told him, That if he pleaded Not Guilty,
these his Declarations should be heard at large
upon the Evidence.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To part of the Indictment I confess
my self Guilty, which concerneth the
<pagebreak id="118C2" />
decyphering of the Letters by my Lord's Procurement and
Commandment; after which time I never dealt
in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Southcote.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were best to plead Not Guilty
to the whole Indictment; and for such Matters
and Parts of the Indictment as you can clear 
your self, the Jury may find you not Guilty, and
find you Guilty for the rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Attorney
advis'd to the same effect.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am Guilty. I know under how
merciful a Queen I live: I submit my self wholly
to her Majesty's Mercy. I will not stand long
upon that, whereof mine own Conscience
condemneth me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Confess you Guilty to the whole
Indictment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you Guilty of
adhering to, and comforting the Queen's
Enemies, and the conveying of the
<font>French</font> Packet and Money that was sent to relieve
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess my self Guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj.</font> Then, after some pause, Mr. Serjeant
<font>Barham</font> spake to this effect:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Forasmuch as <font>Robert
Hickford</font> hath been indicted of High-Treason, and
among other things, that he hath adher'd to and
comforted the Queen's Enemies, and the same
Indictment hath been read unto him, and he hath
confess'd the Treasons; I am to pray your
Lordships, on the Queen's Majesty's behalf, that his
Confession may be entred, and Judgment given
for the Queen against him, according to the Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May I now declare to what Points I
am not Guilty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There are two Points in the
Indictment that concern your self; the Dealing in the
Matter about <font>Rodolph's</font> Voyage, and the
Instruction for the same, and the adhering to and
comforting of the Queen's Enemies: Are you not
Guilty of these?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am Guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will yet wave and forsake your
Confession, we are content to admit you to do so,
and you may yet plead Not Guilty, and you shall
have your Trial.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I will submit me wholly to her
Majesty's Mercy. I know under how merciful a
Prince I live, tho my Deserts be far unworthy,
by my Master's Means and Procurement. I know
I bring, as I said, a Conscience untouch'd with
any Intent or Meaning of Hurt to her Majesty's
Person, or to my Country. And this I say before
God, and in the Presence and Witness of you
all; howbeit the Law accepteth not, nor judgeth
by secret Intents, for so might every Man clear
himself.

<pagebreak id="120C2" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech you, my Lord, let me use
a few words, to declare the Course of my
Doing. My Lord was not then deliver'd: Shortly
after it happen'd, that by occasion of a Sickness,
and being sick of the Plague in the <font>Tower</font> , my
Lord was remov'd to his own House at the
<font>Charter-house</font> ; then we had great hope that we
should shortly be receiv'd into her Majesty's
Favour, and come to the Court again, and so
continu'd till the Cypher came from the Bishop of
<font>Rosse</font> , before which time and since I was never
privy to that Matter. The Cause why I was
never afterward made privy, was this; My Lord
being at home at his House at <font>Charter-house</font> , I
told him, I lik'd not this Doing, it would not have
good end.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you then still follow? Why
left you him not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He answer'd me, thou art a Fool,
thou understandest not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told you Truth, that you were a
Fool, for you play'd the Fool indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would then have gone from him,
and I sought to depart; he would never give me 
leave, as Mr. <font>Bannister</font> well knoweth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why? he was not your Prince, you were
not so bound that he could compel you to tarry
with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Otherwise I dealt not with the Bishop
of <font>Rosse</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Catlin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In following him, the Hurt was yours;
if you had been a good Subject, and had regard
of your Duty, you might and should have taken
other Course; but you had a higher Hope, to
have seen your Master in higher State to advance
you; you had more Respect to your Master than
to your Mistress.
   But this is nothing to the Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>So his purpos'd longer Speech was cut off, and
then he said shortly thus:</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Hickford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I humbly thank your Lordship again
for your good Admonition; and as your Lordship
hath rehears'd the History of the <font>French</font>
Embassador to the Duke of <font>Milan</font> , so I would and pray
God, that he that hath brought my Lord to this
<pagebreak id="121C1" />
may have the like Success. I humbly submit my
self to the Queen's Majesty's Mercy. I know I
have liv'd under a most gracious and merciful
Queen. I wish God long to preserve her
Majesty, and this little time that I have left I will
spend in Prayer for her Preservation; and I
beseech God have Mercy upon me.
<pagebreak id="121C2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Whereunto the Court, and all that were present,
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Amen</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and some said secretly, he had then
shew'd himself a wiser Man than his Master.</nonSpeech>
