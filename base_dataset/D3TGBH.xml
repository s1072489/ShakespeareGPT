</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then Mr.</font> Bedlow <font>was Sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> , Pray do you direct your 
Discourse to the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Attorney</font> , Pray do you Ask him
your Questions, that you may put him in that Method 
you would have him take, to give his Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I would first Ask him this 
Question: What Conference he had with any persons, 
Priests or Others, about Murdering any body?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord and the Jury, I have at other 
times, and in other places, proved what Familiarity I have 
had with the Priests and Jesuits; and if I have not satisfied 
the Court, and Others, about it, yet I have done my 
Duty in endeavouring so to do. My Lord, I have been
several times Treated with, not only about the Plot, but by 
several Persons about Murdering of a Gentleman. They 
never told me who it was that was to be Murdered; but if I 
would Undertake it, they, that is, <font>Le Faire</font> , and <font>Prichard</font> , 
and 
Mr. <font>Kaines</font> , and several other <font>Priests</font> , who discoursed with 
me about it, would find out some to Assist me, and my 
Reward should be very Considerable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in <font>October</font> last, about the        
beginning, 
or latter end of <font>September</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir, Go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did Adhere to them all along, for I had 
a mind to Discover two Years ago, but was prevented; 
and I only drill'd them on, to know the Party, that I 
might prevent them. But they would never Discover the 
Party.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee come to this particular part 
of the Story.
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Afterwards they set me to insinuate my self 
into the Acquaintance of Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> , not telling 
me they had any design upon him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Le Fair</font> , and <font>Pritchard</font> , and        
<font>VVelsh</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Girald</font> was not one, was he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord. But they told me that 
afterwards they would have me introduce them into his 
Acquaintance. And I had been, I think, Six or Seven dayes 
together with Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> , at his House, and had 
got much into his Acquaintance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By what means did you get into his 
Acquaintance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I pretended to get Warrants for the 
Good Behaviour against persons, that there were none 
such.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, and what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was the Week before the Saturday 
that he was Kill'd; and I was there every day but 
Saturday. On the <font>Friday</font> I went to the 
<font>Grey-Hound-Tavern</font> , and I sent my Boy to see if Sir <font>Edmondbury 
Godfrey</font> were at Home. Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> was not at 
Home then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The very Day before he was Kill'd. If 
he had been at Home, I would have gone over to 
him, and would have desired him to come over to 
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Priests there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, there was <font>Pritchard</font> , and 
<font>Le Faire</font> , and <font>VVelch</font> , and <font>Kaines</font> , and another; five   
<font>Jesuites</font> :
and, as I said, I sent my Boy to see if he were at home, 
and he brought me word he was not; and if he had, 
I was to have gone to him, to have fetch'd him 
thither, that they might Insinuate themselves into his
Acquaintance. And indeed, they had Tongue enough to <font>wheedle</font> 
themselves into any ones Acquaintance. So he not being at 
home, we came into the City, two of the <font>Jesuites</font> and I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Le Faire</font> and <font>VVelsh</font> . The next Morning 
<pagebreak id="30" />
<font>Le Faire</font> came to my Chamber, and I was not then 
within; but by Accident I met him, about four of the Clock, 
in <font>Lincolnes-Inn-Fields</font> . We went to the <font>Palsgraves-Head</font> 
Tavern; where falling into Discourse, he told me there vvas 
a Gentleman that vvas to be put out of the vvay; that 
vvas the Phrase he used, he did not really say <font>Murther</font> him; 
for they don't count it Murther.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, No, they put it into softer
Termes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They told me it vvas to be done to Night. I 
asked vvho it vvas, they said it vvas a very material Man: For 
he had all the Informations that Mr. <font>Oates</font> and Dr. <font>Tongue</font> 
had given in; that several had been imployed in the 
doing of it, that several Attempts had been made, and that 
they had miss'd several Opportunities, and had not done 
it till then; but if he should not be taken out of the way, 
and the Papers taken from him, the business would be 
so Obstructed, and go near to be Discovered, to that 
Degree, that they would not be able to bring this 
Design to pass, but must stay till another Age before they 
should Effect it. I asked him again, who it was, he 
sayd he would not tell me, but it was a very material 
Man. I told him, that according to my Promise I would 
Assist; but in such a Case, I should need a great many 
Men to be with me, he being so considerable a Person. I
asked him then, where the Money was, that was 
formerly promised? he told me no worse a Man was 
Engaged for it, than my Lord <font>Bellasis</font> , and Mr. <font>Coleman</font> had 
order to pay it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was that Reward?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Four Thousand pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was it that first named this 
Gentleman to you to be Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They never named him to me at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us know when you first knew it 
to be Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I parted with him then, but came not 
according to my Promise. I was to meet him at the 
Cloysters at <font>Somerset-House</font> that night; but I knew their 
Design was to Murder some body, and I would not come. 
<pagebreak id="31" />
I saw him no more till Monday Night, then I met him 
in Red-Lyon-Court, where he put up his Cane to his 
Nose; as who should say, I was to blame in not keeping
my Promise. And we went together to the 
<font>Grey-Hound-Tavern</font> in <font>Fleet-street</font> , where he charged me with 
my breach of 
Promise. I told him I was taken up by other Company, and
unless they would tell me who it was I was to Kill, I would 
have no hand in it: For I did not know but that it might 
be my own particular Friend. And I would not murther 
any private person, unless I knew who it was, and for 
what Reason. Well, says he, we will tell you more 
anon if you meet me to night at <font>Somerset-House</font> , at nine a
Clock. I did meet him exactly at that time in the 
Cloysters, where we walk't and talk't a great while. And then 
he took me into the middle of the Court, and told me, 
you have don ill, that you did not help in this business;
but if you will help to carry him off, you shall have half 
the Reward. Why said I, <font>Is he Murdered</font> ? <font>Yes</font> , said he; 
<font>May not I see him</font> , sayd I? <font>Yes, you may</font> , sayd he: and so   
took 
me by the hand, and led me into the Room through a 
dark Entry. In the Room were a great many, I can't tell 
who they all were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many were there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There might stand a great many behind 
one another. I saw Four or Five.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What kind of Light had they, Mr. 
<font>Praunce</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a middle-sized Lanthorn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it a small Light, or a great Light?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a small Light.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had they no Light, but that Lanthorn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: And they did not open it till I had 
had a turn about in the Room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they discourse of carrying him
away then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know him, when he lay Dead there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, your Lordship shall hear how I came 
to know him. One stept to the Body, and threw off the 
thing that laid upon him, and I went and Lookt upon him; 
<pagebreak id="32" />
and he had got about his Neck, such a kind of a fashion'd
Cravat as this about my Neck; and I went to try, and 
could not get my Finger in betwixt. So I saw him, his 
Bosome was all open, and I knew him presently: For 
those Jesuits that were there, were not those who had 
employed me to insinuate my self into his Acquaintance; and 
so they thought I had not known him. I Asked who it 
was, they said it was a man that belong'd to a person of 
Quality. I was mightily struck and daunted, when I 
knew him: I would fain have perswaded them to have 
Tyed Weights at his Head and Feet, and Thrown him 
into the River; and afterwards I would have dragg'd for
him, and took him up there. But they did not think 
that so safe: <font>No</font> (said they) <font>we will put it upon himself, there 
are none but Friends concerned</font> . I Asked <font>Le Faire</font> , how they 
would get him out? They said, <font>In a Chair</font> . Then I 
Asked them, which way they would get him into the Chair,
and out of the Gate. They said <font>The Porter was to sit up 
to let them Out</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Porter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Porter of the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who, <font>Berry</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. As for that <font>Hill</font> , or the Old Man, 
I do not know that I ever had any particular knowledge 
of them; but only I looked upon them as ill-designing 
men, seeing them in the Chappel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see ere a one of the Three
Prisoners there at that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord: But I have such a
Remembrance of Faces, that I could tell, if I saw them again, any 
that I did see there, though the Light was but small. They 
told me <font>They had Strangl'd him</font> ; but how, I did not know. 
When they press'd me to help to carry him out, I then
Excused my self, and said, It was too Early to carry him out 
yet; but about <font>Eleven</font> or <font>Twelve</font> a Clock would be a better 
time. And I assured them I would come again. Said <font>Le Faire</font> 
to me, <font>Upon the Sacrament you took on Thursday, you will be at 
the Carrying Off of this Man at Night</font> . I promised him I would. 
And he went away, and left me there. I made what speed 
away I could, for I was very Unsatisfied in my self,
<pagebreak id="33" />
having so great a charge upon me, as the Sacrament of the 
Altar, which after the discovery of the Plot, was 
Administred to me twice a Week to conceal it, I could not tell 
how to discover: I went then to <font>Bristol</font> , but very restless 
and disturbed in my mind; and being perswaded by what 
God was pleased to put into my mind, calling to 
remembrance that some Murders had been already committed, and 
greater ones were dayly intended, I was at last convinc't, and
could no longer forbear discovery. I wrote to the Secretary of 
it, and went to the Parliament and gave in my information. 
And one day I met with Mr. <font>Praunce</font> in the Lobby, and knew
him, and apprehended him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will ask you one question, Had you any 
discourse with Mr. <font>Praunce</font> between the time you saw him 
with the Body, and the day he was apprehended.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never saw him to this day, to have 
any converse with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Wild,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you see <font>Hill</font> that night when 
you were to have carried him away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Wild,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor <font>Green</font> , nor <font>Berry</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Green</font> I did see about the Court, and     
<font>Berry</font> I
was told was to open the Gate that <font>Monday</font> night. But my 
Lord, when they found I did not come again, they desisted 
that night, and kept it off longer, for fear I should come 
again to stop them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did not refuse to help them, but promised 
to do it and failed: and they finding that he had failed them, 
would not let the body lye where it was for fear of discovery,
but removed back again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Dolben,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did <font>Praunce</font> say, when you   
first 
took notice of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understood afterwards                      
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: aftewards</comment> that he was taken 
upon suspicion, because at that time, his Maid had made a 
discovery, that he was about that time out of his Lodgings. 
And while he was there in the Constables Hands Mr. <font>Oates</font>
came by, and he desired to see him; and presently after I came 
thither, and the Constable asked him, Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , will you 
see Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> ? No, he said, he would not: Then he put 
his Hat over his eyes that I might not see his face, and kept 
<pagebreak id="34" />
it so. The press being great, and being desirous to be 
private my self, I spoke to the Guard to put all out that had 
no business there, and they cried out, that all should avoid
the Room but Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> and his Friends. And when he 
was going out with the rest, he lift up his Hat to see his way; 
and though before I did not mind him, yet I happened at 
his passing by me to cast my eyes upon his face, and
presently knew him, and cried, Oh! pray Sir stay, you are one of 
my friends that must stay here. And I presently charged my 
Guards to take charge of him. Saith the Constable, he is 
my Prisoner: Is he so, said I? Then you have a very good 
Prisoner, and pray look safe to him. And then when I went 
into the House of Lords, I made out my charge against 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now if the Prisoners have any questions to 
ask Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> , they may have free liberty to do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw him before in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know <font>Mr. Berry</font> , and <font>Green</font> very    
well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , was the Dark-Lanthorn   
at <font>Hill's</font>  
Lodging, or at the other place?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the other place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you here Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , They carried   
him to 
<font>Hill's</font> on <font>Saturday</font> night, and he lay there till <font>Monday</font>   
night: 
What time on <font>Monday-night</font> was it that they removed him 
into <font>Somerset-house</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not there when they did remove him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time did you see him there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About Nine or Ten a Clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time was it that you saw him there Mr. 
<font>Bedlow</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bedlow,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was after Nine my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They had then removed him to 
<font>Somerset-house</font> , and Mr. <font>Hill</font> asked what they intended to do 
with the 
Body? They said, they would carry it out that night, but 
they did not. But there the Dark-Lanthorn was, and on
<font>Tuesday-night</font> they removed him back again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now my Lord, if you please, we shall go on 
to call some Witnesses that were not present at the Murder; 
for direct Evidence, as to that, can come only out of the 
<pagebreak id="35" />
mouth of some that were concerned in it; but to
corroborate by concurrent circumstances, the Testimony which hath 
been already given. And first we shall call the Constable, 
to prove that he found Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> in the Fields, 
in the same manner in which Mr. <font>Praunce</font> says they told him 
they left him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Attorney, you promised you would prove, 
that when these persons were examined, they did deny 
before the House of Lords, that they knew <font>Praunce</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, in that we were mistaken, I 
understand now, it was only <font>Berry</font> denied that he did know 
<font>Girald</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, did you never know Mr. <font>Gerald</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , have not you seen <font>Girald</font> 
with 
<font>Berry</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have, but they usually went by 
several Names.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see <font>Girald</font> in <font>Hill's</font>      
company?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, that I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there no Sentinel set that                 
<font>Monday-night</font> , that
<font>Saturday-night</font> , and that <font>Wednesday-night</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I am not certain, I took notice 
of none; if there were any, they were at <font>Berry's</font> House, and 
he opened the Gate, when we came out with the Sedan.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Berry</font> , I suppose, could take order  
with 
the Sentinel, and give them some entertainment in his own 
Lodg.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then Mr.</font> Brown <font>the Constable was Sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, in what posture did you find Sir 
<font>Edmundbury Godfrey</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I found him, my Lord, in a Ditch, with his 
Sword through him, and the end of it was two handfulls 
out of his back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he Bloody?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no Blood at all, there was no Blood 
in the Ditch.
<pagebreak id="36" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Sword sticking in his Body?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, My Lord, but there was no Blood at all 
when it was taken out; they had run it into another place, 
but that happened to be against a Rib, and so it could not 
go through; but there was no blood there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any bruises on his Breast?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did look black about the Breast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I would ask, whether his Neck were 
broken?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I suppose it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was very weak, and one might turn his Head 
from one Shoulder to the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was his Stick and Gloves?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were on the Bank-side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose Sword was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Servants said it was his own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, had he any Money in his Pocket?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, a great deal of Gold and Silver.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Ay, for they count Theft Sin, but not 
Murder.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Justice Wild,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They left that, to let men think he 
murdered himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, will you ask this Witness any questions 
before he goes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Capt. <font>Richardson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They say they will ask him none.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font> Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then we desire to call the Chyrurgeons that 
view'd and opened the Body, Mr. <font>Skillard</font> , and Mr. <font>Cambridge</font> ;
both whom were Sworn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We begin with Mr. <font>Skillard</font> , Pray, Sir,  
inform 
my Lord and the Jury, Did you see the Body of Sir 
<font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did view the Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When? what time did you see it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About Twelve of the Clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What day of the Week was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On <font>Friday</font> , the next day after he was 
found.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe his Breast? how was 
it?
<pagebreak id="37" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His breast was all beaten with some obtuse 
weapon, either with the feet or hands, or something.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe his neck?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was distorted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You might have taken the Chin and have set 
it upon either Shoulder.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe the wound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did. It went in at one place and    
stopt 
at a Rib, the other place it was quite through the Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think he was killed by that wound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, for then there would have been some 
evacuation of Blood, which there was not. And besides his 
bosome was open, and he had a Flannel Wastcoat and a 
Shirt on; and neither those, nor any of his Clothes were 
penetrated.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But are you sure his neck had been broken?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because some have been of opinion, that he 
hanged himself, and his Relations to save his estate run him 
through; I would desire to ask the Chyrurgeon what he thinks 
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was more done to his neck than an 
ordinary suffocation; the wound went through his very heart, 
and there would have appeared some blood, if it had been 
done quickly after his death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did it appear by the view of the body that 
he was strangled or hanged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was a lean man, and his muscles if he had 
died of the wound, would have been turgid: and then again 
all strangled people never swell, because there is a sudden
deprivation of all the spirits, and a hindring of the Circulation 
of the blood.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long do you believe he might be dead 
before you saw him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Skillard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe four or five days. And they might 
have kept him a week and he never swell'd at all, being a 
lean man. And when we ript him up, he began for to 
putrify, we made two incisions to give it vent, and the liquor that 
was in his body did a little smell. The very lean flesh was so
<pagebreak id="38" />
near turned into putrefaction, that it stuck to the Instrument 
when we cut it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord here is another Chyrurgeon, Mr. 
<font>Cambridge</font> ; Pray, Sir are you sworn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cambridge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you see the body of Sir 
<font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cambridge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon friday, the very same day the 
Gentleman did. I found his neck dislocated, and his breast very 
much beaten and bruised. And I found two punctures under 
his left Pap, the one went against the Rib, the other quite 
through the body under the left Pap.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe that wound was the occasion 
of his death?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cambridge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I believe it was given him after his 
death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And his neck was broke?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cambridge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His neck was dislocated, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, that is broken. Now my Lord we shall
call Sir <font>Edmundbury Godfreys</font> Maid, <font>Elizabeth Curtis</font> . Swear
her. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which was done.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Lordship knows that Mr. <font>Praunce</font>   
did say 
in the beginning, that they had been several times at his House 
inquiring for him: now we call this person to tell you what 
she knows about that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Elizabeth Curtis</font> , look upon the         
Prisoners, and 
tell my Lord and the Jury whether you know any of them 
or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Elizabeth Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This man that I now hear called       
<font>Green</font> , my 
Lord, was at my Masters about a fortnight before he died.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What to do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eliz. Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know, but he asked for Sir        
<font>Edmondbury 
Godfrey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time of the day was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eliz. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in the morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eliz. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He asked for Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> , 
and 
when he came to him, he said, Good morrow, Sir, in <font>English</font> , 
and afterwards spoke to him in <font>French</font> , I could not 
understand him.
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire she may consider well, and look 
upon him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eliz. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is the man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Green.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Soul I never saw him in all my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eliz. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He had a darker coloured Perriwig when he 
was there, and was about a quarter of an hour talking with 
my Master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure this was the man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am, and that other man <font>Hill</font> was   
there that 
Saturday morning, and did speak with him before he went 
out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you will deny too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know he was there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was in the Parlor at that time, making up  
the 
fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you ever seen him before that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never before that time. I went into the 
Parlor to carry my Master his Break-fast, and brought a bunch of 
Keys with me in, and there <font>Hill</font> was with him. And I went 
up stairs about some business, and came down again wanting 
the Keys, which I had left upon the Table; and <font>Hill</font> was all 
that time with my Master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know he was there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was in the Parlor and stirred up the fire, 
and 
he was there a good while.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long after did you see him again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till I saw him in <font>Newgate</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was that afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A month ago. But it is not the man that      
brought 
the note to my Master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What note?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A note that a man brought to my Master that  
night 
before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is become of that Note?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I cannot tell, my Master had it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee, tell us the story of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a man came to my Masters House, and 
asked if Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> were within. He said he had 
a Letter for him; and shewed it me, it was tied up in a knot. 
<pagebreak id="40" />
I told him my Master was within, but busy; but said I, if you 
please I will carry it into him: he did so, and I gave it to my
Master; when I went out again, the man staid and asked for an 
Answer: I went in again and told my Master that the man 
required an Answer. Prithee, said he, tell him I don't know what 
to make of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wild,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On Friday night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When? The Friday night before he was 
murdered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you Swear that <font>Hill</font> was there the    
Saturday 
morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Clothes was he then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same Clothes that he hath now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wild,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure they are the same Clothes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a great Circumstance my Lord. I asked    
her what Clothes he was in when he came to Sir <font>Edmondbury's</font> ; 
and she saith, the same that he hath now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you ever shifted your Clothes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No indeed, I have not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But for the man that brought the Note, I     
cannot 
Swear it is he.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But she did say when she came to see me in        
<font>Newgate</font> , 
that she never saw me in my life; and my Lord I hope I 
have sufficient VVitnesses to prove where I was that 
morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She says, she cannot Swear you were the man that 
brought the Note.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire she will tell me about what     
time it 
was I was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. Curtis,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was about nine or ten a Clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That agrees with Mr. <font>Praunces</font> exactly in 
point 
of time. Now if your Lordship please, we will proceed and 
call Mr. <font>Lancellot Stringer</font> , and Mr. <font>Vincent</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we do call these Witnesses to 
prove, that these men had meetings with Mr. <font>Praunce</font> at the 
Plow.
<pagebreak id="41" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then was</font> Lancelot Stringer <font>sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray tell my Lord and the Jury whether 
you know Mr. <font>Prance</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seen him at the <font>Plow</font> at any  
time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what company there? Was Mr. <font>Green</font>  
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which was he? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>He points to him.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And who else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was that <font>Hill</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How often?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Several times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long before Sir <font>Edmundbury Godfrey</font> was 
murdered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any other company was with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, there were several other company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was Mr. <font>Fitz-Girald</font> and Mr.      
<font>Hill</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet <font>Hill</font> saith he never saw       
<font>Girald</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And there was <font>Kelly</font> , he was another   
of them, 
and <font>Prance</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know <font>Vernatt</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now? What say you to it Mr. <font>Hill</font> , and 
Mr. 
<font>Green</font> ? Were you never at the <font>Plow</font> , drinking with Mr.       
<font>Prance</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, several times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you, Mr. <font>Green</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Green.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have drank with him there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know <font>Girald</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know one <font>Girald</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now will your Lordship please to let me 
prove, that at the Council he owned he knew <font>Girald</font> and <font>Kelly</font> ,
and now 'tis proved he hath been in <font>Kelly's</font> company, he says 
he does not know <font>Girald</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, that was a mistake, for I do know        
<font>Kelly</font> by 
sight, that is, I knew two Men that used the Chappel very 
much, and he was one of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you, Witness, say you have seen <font>Girald</font> 
and them 
together?
<pagebreak id="42" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many times?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell how many, my Lord, several 
times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seen them twice together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now to settle it I would ask him, with your 
Lordship's favour, when he came to live with his Master. 
You, young Man, when did you come to live with your Master 
at the <font>Plow</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I have been with him two years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Rec.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But when was it you came last to live at the    
<font>Plow</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Bartholomew-tide</font> last.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was but five Weeks before Sir           
<font>Edmondbury 
Godfrey</font> was Murdered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you, <font>Green</font> , know Mr. <font>Girald</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Green.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then pray Swear Mr. <font>Vincent</font> .          
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Which was done.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, pray Sir, do you live at the         
<font>Plow</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then pray, do you tell my Lord, and the 
Jury, if you know any of the Prisoners at the Bar, and which 
of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know Mr. <font>Green</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know anybody else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I know <font>Hill</font> , and I know Mr.          
<font>Berry</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Rec.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seen these persons at your House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell every body with whom they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they there with <font>Praunce</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know one <font>Girald</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath he been at your house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, he hath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell justly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know <font>Kelly</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath he been there?
<pagebreak id="43" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he hath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Company?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With <font>Praunce</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And with any of the Prisoners?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Vincent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but I can't tell particularly with whom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attor. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, my Lord, as these were meetings 
before the fact was committed to consult how to do it; so 
we at the beginning told you of a meeting after it was done, 
and that was at <font>Bow</font> . We shall therefore call some Witnesses 
as to that; and they are <font>Richard Cary</font> , and <font>William Evans</font> . 
First swear <font>Richard Cary</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Which was done.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember you were sent of a message 
from the <font>Queens-Head</font> at <font>Bow</font> , and whether? Pray tell my Lord, 
and the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember it very well; there were three 
Gentlemen that sent for me to the <font>Queens-Head</font> , and I being sent 
for 
did come, and when I came up stairs, they asked me if I 
knew <font>Poplar</font> , I said I knew it very well. Then they asked 
me if I knew Mr. <font>Dethick</font> , I told them I thought I did. Then 
said they, you must carry this Letter to <font>George Dethick</font> , Esq; at 
<font>Poplar</font> , and deliver it to his own hands, and to no body else. 
Accordingly away I went, and carried the Letter: I went to 
the door, and asked if he were within; his Man said he was 
above stairs, but they would call him to me; and calling him
to me, Sir, said I, there are some Gentlemen at the <font>Queens-Head</font> 
at <font>Bow</font> that have sent me with a Letter to you. So he looked 
upon the Letter, and, saith he, go and tell them I will be with 
them presently. So, may it please you, my Lord, I came 
again, and when I came, the Gentlemen were there still. Well, 
said they, go and drink a Glass of Claret, which stood upon 
the Table, and they gave me Six-pence, and I went away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray look upon Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , can you 
remember whether that man was there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were three of them, and he looks like 
one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , do you remember this was 
the 
man you sent?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, this was the same Man that 
was sent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, call the other.
<pagebreak id="44" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then</font> William Evans, <font>the Boy of the House at the</font>

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hark you, do you remember any 
Company that was at your Masters house two or three Months 
agon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember that you heard them talk 
any thing there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They pull'd out a Paper and read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You Boy, do you know Mr. <font>Dethick</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did come to them, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What had they to Dinner there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They had Flounders.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who bought them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One of them, I can't tell who.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What had they else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Barrel of Oysters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray give my Lord an accompt what you 
observed and heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Evans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I know nothing but that they pull'd out a 
Paper, and read it, and named Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey's</font> Name. 
And while I was at the door, some body came and threatned 
to kick me down stairs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He saith just as Mr. <font>Praunce</font> said in every 
particular.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attor. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now if it please your Lordship, we desire 
to call Sir <font>Robert Southwell</font> , to prove what Mr. <font>Praunce</font> said 
before the Council, and how particular he was; and did to some 
of the Lords, who were sent with him to <font>Somerset-House</font> , point 
out the places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We call him to shew, that when <font>Praunce</font> 
was examined before the King, he was sent with some of the 
Lords, and Sir <font>Robert Southwell</font> , to <font>Somerset-House</font> , where he 
pointed with his Finger, and shewed the places where all 
was done; and so we shall shew your Lordship and the 
Jury, how exact he was in every thing.
<pagebreak id="45" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Sir Robert Southwell</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir <font>Robert</font> , will you tell your 
knowledge?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was upon the twenty    
fourth 
of <font>December</font> waiting upon his Majesty in Council, and Mr. 
<font>Praunce</font> was sent for, to speak his knowledge concerning this 
Murder, and he then gave a general Account of things, which, 
because it did relate to that Bench, and this Corner, and 
that Room, and that Passage, and that Gallery, it was 
not understood by the Board, and thereupon his Majesty 
thought fit to appoint my Lord Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> , and the
Earl of <font>Ossory</font> , and Mr. <font>Vice-Chamberlain</font> to the Queen, to go 
thither, and take the Examination upon the Place, and 
Report it to the Board: And I, being Clerk of of the                 
<comment type="compiler">THE WORD of OCCURS TWICE IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> Council, 
though not in waiting at that time, and having taken notice 
of what Mr. <font>Praunce</font> had there deposed, I did wait upon 
those Lords, and took the Examination upon the Place. And 
what I did take upon the place, This was done here, and 
that there, I drew up into a Report, and the Report is 
Signed by those two Noble Lords, and was read that Afternoon 
at the Board; and to that I referr my self.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir <font>Robert</font> , Did he shew the 
particular places to those Lords?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he did. First, the Bench     
whereon 
they were sitting when Sir <font>Edmondbury Godfrey</font> was coming 
down; then the Corner into which they drew him when they
had strangled him; then the Place where one <font>Berry</font> went to 
stay, which was at the Stairs that lead to the Upper Court, 
then a little door at the end of the Stables, which lead up 
a pair of Stairs, and at the head of the Stairs a long dark
Entry, and at the top of those Staires, a door on the left 
hand, which being opened, shew'd us eight steps, which 
lead up to the Lodgings that were Dr. <font>Godwins</font> : In which 
<font>Hill</font> was said to be inhabitant for seven years before. And
<pagebreak id="46" />
assoon as we were gone two steps, there was a little Closet 
or Cabinet on the right hand, in which there was a Bed, 
and there he shewed my Lords, This is the Place where we 
handed him up first, and here we left him, said he, in the care 
of <font>Hill</font> for two nights.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were there, Sir <font>Robert          
Southwell</font> upon 
the place, when he shew'd them these things?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, I was there.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it answerable to what he had      
declared 
to the King and Council?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was answerable to all     
things he had 
said in the morning.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And suitable to what he says now?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, suitable to what he sayes now, 
but only now he sayes more than he said then. And as to 
what he sayes about the Chambers of Sir <font>John Arundell</font> ,
they could not be Sir <font>John's</font> Lodgings, for they were not
capable of receiving a Person of that Quality.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said, I did believe they did belong to Sir 
<font>John Arundell</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were Lodgings perhaps that belong'd 
to 
his Servants, though not to him.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Robert</font> , I desire to know,     
whether Mr. 
<font>Praunce</font> , when he shew'd these places, and made these 
Descriptions, did he do it with any hesitancy, or did he do it 
readily?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hitherto, my Lord, he went directly 
and positively, as if any body should walk to 
<font>Westminster-Hall</font> door. But afterwards, when the Lords did desire 
to know 
whither the Body was carried, he said, it was into some Room
of the house by the Garden; for this is an Outer part of the 
House, which any body may do any thing in, without their 
knowledge that are within. And he undertook to lead them 
<pagebreak id="47" />
to the place as well as he could; and so away we went 
through the long dark Entry that leads into the Outer Court 
of the Great House; and crossing the Quadrangle, he leads 
us to the <font>Piazza</font> , and down a pair of Stairs, and so far, 
said he, I am sure I went; then, assoon as we were down the
Stairs, there is a great Square Court, then he began to
stagger, as if he did not know his way, but there was no way 
but to go on hovvever, and on vve vvent, and coming cross 
the Court, vve came into several Rooms, and going through 
them, vve came up Stairs again, and so into several other
Rooms again. Sure, said he, vve vvere here, but I can't 
tell, and he vvas in a great Distraction vvhat Room he savv 
the Body in; but, said he, thus far, I am certain I am 
right; vvhich vvas according to the Paper, and I refer my 
self to that.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, you say, that what he had said to 
the Lords in the Council, was the same that he said when you 
were by upon the place?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His doubtfulness of the Room does assert, 
and give Credit to his Testimony, and Confirms it to any 
honest man in <font>England</font> . Here, saith he, I will not be 
positive, but having sworn the other things which he well 
remembred, positively, he is made the more Credible for his
doubtfulness of a thing which he does not remember, which a 
man that could swear any thing would not stick at.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Besides, he was not there but by     
night, 
and all the Light he had was a dark Lanthorn.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, Sir <font>Robert</font> , I would ask you one 
Question, if you please, Do you remember that <font>Hill</font> was Examined 
at the Council about this matter?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Robert Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, these are the Notes      
that I 
took upon these Mens Examinations, if your Lordship pleases 
they may be read.
<pagebreak id="48" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir Robert</font> , We ask you but as to one 
particular thing, therefore if you please to look upon it, and 
refresh your Memory, you may read it to your self, and tell us 
only the substance; </dialogue><nonSpeech>which he did.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now Sir, if you please, Do you remember   
that 
<font>Hill</font> was there?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir. Rob. Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I find he was Examined.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not he deny there that he knew       
<font>Kelly</font> , but 
that he knew <font>Girald</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Rob. Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do find it here set down     
that he did 
deny he knew <font>Kelly</font> , but that he knew <font>Girald</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said I knew one <font>Girald</font> , but not that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But before the Council he said he knew    
<font>Girald</font> , 
not one <font>Girald</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Chief Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This way of Answering is like the 
Examination that was taken lately amongst some of them. A 
Person was asked when he saw such a Priest? He denied that he 
had seen him in fourteen dayes. But then comes one and 
proves to his face, that he was with him in Company all Night, 
within a Week and less. I, sayes he, that's true, but I said I 
had not seen him in Fourteen Dayes. And so they may take 
Oaths to serve the King faithfully all the Dayes of their 
Lives, but in the Nights they may murther him, and keep
their Oaths for all that.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would know, whether the <font>Girald</font>  
you know 
be a Priest or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you do not know <font>Girald</font> the 
Priest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I do not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mr. <font>Thomas Stringer</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>And he was 
sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mr. <font>Stringer</font> , will you tell my  
Lord and 
the Jury what it was that Mr. <font>Berry</font> said about any 
directions he had to keep all Persons out of <font>Somerset-House</font> ,    
about the 
twelfth or fourteenth of <font>October</font> last?
<pagebreak id="49" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, upon his Examination before the 
Lords of the Committee, <font>Berry</font> did say he had Orders from the 
Queen, or in the Name of the Queen, That he should suffer no 
Strangers, nor any Persons of Quality to come into 
<font>Somerset-House</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was it he was to keep them out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 12th 13th and 14th of <font>October</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, three days?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two or three days. And he said that the 
Prince did come, and he did refuse him, and sent him back 
again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Record.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say he ever had any such Directions 
before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: he said he never before had any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a very unlucky thing that he had it 
then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Prince might have gone in if he would.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said you did refuse him, you had    
order 
to let none come in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any such Order?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, I had such an Order from the Queen's 
Gentleman-Usher.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you never had such before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have had before, since the Queen came to 
<font>Somerset-House</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Stringer</font> swears you said you had   
not 
any before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you deny it then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not deny it; besides, there were several   
went in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Record.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have proved indeed five or six did go in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For how many days had you that Order?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two days.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which two days?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The eleventh and twelfth, I think thereabouts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Record.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you say before the Lords, that you never 
had 
such Orders before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Berry</font> , When you were examined     
before the 
Lords, Did you not say you never had such Orders before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not say so, my Lord, as I know of; for 
they 
did not examine me about that.
<pagebreak id="50" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said you would prove it under his own  
Hand. 
Prove that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Stringer</font> , Did he write his Name   
to his 
Examination?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he did to one Examination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray look upon that, Is that his Hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was read to him before he Signed   
it, and 
then he did Sign it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would fain shew it to him, to see        
whether he 
Would own it or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, that is my Hand.

This Deponent saith, That about the 12th, 13th, and 14th of 
<font>October</font> last, he had Order to tell all Persons of Quality, that  
the 
Queen was private, and that they were not to come in; and 
this Deponent saith, The Queen continued so private for two
days.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is that part of the Examination      
wherein he 
said, he never had any such Order before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>T. Stringer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did say so, but it is not in that

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, my Lord, observe this is a kind of 
reflecting Evidence, and I Would have no more made of it than the 
thing will bear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They only bring it, and make use of it     
against 
<font>Berry</font> , as a pretence of his.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But it is a very reflecting Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely there is no body here that offers   
it as 
such: We use it only to this purpose, to shew that <font>Berry</font> , who was 
a Party to this Murder, did use all the means that he could to keep it 
private; and endeavoured to prevent Strangers coming in that 
Night to discover it, and therefore pretended these Orders.
   If he had any such Orders, I suppose he will prove them, we do 
not say he had them; but 'tis a great Evidence, when he pretended 
to such privacie, that he and his Fellows had something to do that 
was not fit to be known by every body.
<pagebreak id="51" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Record.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He may make use of any body's Name, and

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have one Witness more to call, my Lord, 
and that is one <font>Farr</font> . Call <font>Stephen Farr</font> .  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which was done, and he sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is a Neighbour to <font>Berry</font> , and will

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray then tell what you know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know him very well, his Wife hath been with 
me last Week, and asked me if I knew what time he was with 
me on <font>Wednesday</font> , the 16th of <font>October</font> . I desired time to 
recollect my self: And she called four or five times after, 
and I did recollect my Memory and told her, That I was
not with him at all that <font>Wednesday</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, this was reasonable, and fair enough to 
do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was so, my Lord, but pray had you 
no Money offered you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, none at all; and I told her <font>I</font> could not 
remember that <font>I</font> was with him that day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Berry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you may remember it very well, when <font>I</font> came

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, <font>I</font> was out of Town that 
<font>Wednesday</font> , from two a Clock in the Afternoon, till nine at 
Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, well, this is nothing: The Woman was 
willing if she could, to have counterproved the Evidence, 
and what she did was fair; she offered no Money, nor did 
it in an indirect way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, We have now done with our

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, what do you ask her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know what you can say about my being in 
my Lodging, and not going out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He hath lived in our Family seven or eight 
Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Family, What is your Family?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With my Uncle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who is your Uncle?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doctor <font>Godwin</font> ; we left him in the House 
always when we were absent from it, he was always a trusty 
Servant, never kept ill hours, always came home by eight a 
Clock at Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Just. <font>Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Always, For how long?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ever since we came over last into          
<font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Just. <font>Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>April</font> last.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you there that Night Sir 
<font>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</font> <comment type="compiler">THE WORD Edmund-Bury SPLIT BY THE          
LINE-BREAK</comment> was kill'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat Night was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know, my Lord, I heard of it in 
the Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhen did you first hear of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Thursday</font> that he was found.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not hear of it on the              
<font>Wednesday</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVho could tell you the <font>Wednesday</font>      
before?
<pagebreak id="53" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, my Lord, in the Town it was said he 
was missing from Saturday, and a Thursday he was found.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can you say concerning <font>Hill</font> , that he 
was 
not out after eight a clock that night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was a very good Servant to my Unkle, 
and never kept ill hours, but always came in by eight a clock 
or before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were not you out your self that     
night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No not I, never out after that hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray how can you give such an accompt of Mr. 
<font>Hill</font> , as if he was always in your company?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He came in to wait at Table, and did not 
stir out afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what Religion are you of? are you a Papist?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not whether I come here to make a 
profession of my Faith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you a Roman Catholick?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you a dispensation to eat Suppers on 
Saturday-nights?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you did not keep him company after 
Supper all night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No I did not, but he came in to wait at 
Table at Supper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought you had kept fasting on 
Saturday-nights.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, not on Saturday-nights.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Dishes of Meat had you to 
Supper?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We had no Meat, though we did not fast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you speak positively as to this night, the 
Saturday that he was kill'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was at home that night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And where was he the Sunday?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was at home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you are sure he was at home every night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, while we were in Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you all that Wednesday-night you 
speak of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was at home in my Lodging.
<pagebreak id="54" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How is it possible for you to say, that  
<font>Hill</font> , who was not your constant Companion, did not go out 
afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he was not my constant Companion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How then can you charge your 
Memory that he was at home?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, you are to speak truth, though you are not 
upon your Oath. Can you charge your memory to say, that 
he came in constantly at eight a clock at night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I can, because I saw him come in 
constantly; and when he came in, I always sent my Maid to bar the 
door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Maid, can you say that he was always at home at 
night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can say he never was abroad after eight at 
night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Recorder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why you did not watch him till he went 
to bed, did you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were always up till eleven a clock at   
night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he in your company all that while?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg your pardon; if your Lordship saw 
the Lodgings, you would say it were impossible for any to go 
in or out, but that they must know it within. We were 
constant in our hours of going to Supper; our doors were 
never opened after he came in to wait at Supper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may say any thing to a Heretick for a      
Papist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a mighty improbable business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was he a Wednesday-night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They have a general Answer for all Questions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who kept the Key of your Lodgings?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Maid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath <font>Hill</font> never kept the
Key?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, the Maid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know but that the Maid 
might let him out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mrs. <font>Broadstreet</font> said at      
first there 
was but one Key; but before the Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> she said 
there was six or seven Keys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you what tricks you put upon us to blind 
<pagebreak id="55" />
us. You come and tell us that he was every night at home by 
eight a clock, and did not stir out, for there was but one 
Lock, and the Maid kept the Key; and yet there were three
or four Keys to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was but one Key to that which kept 
the door fast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Praunce</font> , how many Keys were there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She confessed there were four or five.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time was it that you carried him 
out of <font>Somerset-House</font> on Wednesday-night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Prance.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was about ten or eleven of the clock.    
<font>Hill</font> 
went to fetch the horse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We had never been out of our Lodgings 
after eight a Clock, since we came to Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When were you out of Town?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>October</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, now, Mistris, you have spoil'd 
all; for in <font>October</font> this business was done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have undone the man, instead of 
saving him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, my Lord, I only mistook the Month.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You Woman </dialogue><nonSpeech> (speaking to Mrs                  
<font>Broadstreet</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> what 
Month was it you were out of Town?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>September</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis apparent you consider not what you say, or 
you come hither to say any thing will serve the turn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I do not, for I was out of Town in 
<font>September</font> , came to Town the latter end of <font>September</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must remember what you said, that you came 
to <font>England</font> in <font>April</font> last, and from that time he was always 
within at eight a clock at night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Except that time that we were out of Town, 
which was in <font>September</font> the Summer-time. And it is 
impossible but if the Body was in the House, as <font>Praunce</font> said it  
was, but 
I must see him, or some of us must. I used to go every day 
into that little Room for something or other, and I must needs 
see him if he were there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You told me just now you were not upon 
Confession; and I tell you now so, you are not. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mrs. 
<font>Broadstreet</font> was examined.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="56" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Woman, what say you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We came to Town upon a Monday, 
<font>Michaelmas-day</font> was the Sunday following; and from that time 
neither he nor the Maid used to be abroad after eight a clock: we 
kept very good hours, and he always waited at Supper, and
never went abroad after he came in to wait at Supper: and the 
Lodging was so little, that nothing could be brought in, but 
they must know that were within.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a lower Room than the Chamber, is it   
not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis even with the Dining-Room, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you, Sir <font>Robert Southwell</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Ro. Southwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, it is an extraordinary little 
place; as soon as you get up eight steps, there is a little square 
Entry, and there is this Room on the one Hand, and the 
Dining-Room on the other. I think there is a pair of staires to 
go down at one Corner of the Entry, as I think, but the 
Body was laid in a little square Room at the head of the steps.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And must you go into the Room to go to the 
Dining-Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, 'tis a distinct Room; but the Key was
always in the door, and every day some body went into it for
something or another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you undertake to say it was always in the
door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it constantly was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my own part I will not judge you: 
but that his Body should be carried there about nine a clock at 
night a Saturday-night, and remain there till Monday-night,
'tis very suspitious, that if you were in the House, as you say
you were, and used to go into that Room every day, you
must either hear it brought in, or see it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But we did neither, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Justice Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is well you are not Indicted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Praunce</font> , you know all these       
things to be
false, <font>Mr Praunce</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Praunce.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I lay nothing to your charge; but you
said before the Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> , that <font>Hill</font> was gone from
his Lodgings before that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you, Sir <font>Rob. Southwell</font> ?
<pagebreak id="57" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sr. <font>Rob. South.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There arose a little quarrel
between them about the time that Mr. <font>Hill</font> did leave
those Lodgings. <font>Praunce</font> said it was a Fortnight after;
<font>Hill</font> said when he was upon his Examination, that the
same Saturday that Sr. <font>Edmondbury</font> was missing, he was
treating with his Landlord, and from that time, to the
time he went to his new House, it was about a Week
or a Fortnight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But he did pretend he was gone before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, I did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Witnesses upon Oath Sware it,
and you said it your self, and gave it under your Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord? --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay you will not hear, but you will talk,
you say one thing now, and you set another under your
Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you not a Brother that is in the
Proclamation, one <font>Broadstreet</font> a Priest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have a Brother whose name is             
<font>Broadstreet</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is he not a Priest, and in the
Proclamation?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope, I must not Impeach my Brother
here I said upon my Oath he came to Town a Monday,
and <font>Michaelmas</font> day was the Sunday following, and
<font>Lawrence Hill</font> went away a Fortnight after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sr. <font>Rob. South.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She Swore then two or three Days
after <font>Michaelmas</font> Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must know we can understand you
through all your Arts. It was not convenient for you at
that time to say, that Mr. <font>Hill</font> went away about a
Fortnight after <font>Michaelmas</font> , for then the thing that was
charged to be done part of it in your House, would have been
within the Fortnight, for it was the <font>12th</font> of <font>October</font> , but
then you said only two or three Days.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sr. <font>Rob. South.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She did say my Lord, that about
<font>Miclemas</font> two or three or four Days after he went away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broadstreet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I begg your pardon, I only said I could
not tell the time exactly.
<pagebreak id="58" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well have you any more to say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was never a Day but I went into
that Room for something or other, and if any body came
to see me, there was so little space that the Footmen were
always forced to be in that Room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you there upon Sunday?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary Tilden.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, I was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Dolb.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well I will say no more, call another
Witness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Katharine Lee.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can you say, Maid?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I did never miss him out of the House
at those Hours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May be you did not look for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did go down every Night to the Door to see if
it were lockt, and I went into the Parlor to see that
things were safe there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a Roman Catholick, are you not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Dolben.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Might not he go out of the House,
and you never the wiser?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, for I did not watch him continually.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt. Richardson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All that she says may be true by the
Place. The Servants keep down a paire of Stayres in the
Kitchin, and any one may come in or go out having so
many Keys, and they not know it that are below.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went into the Chamber every morning as I went
to Market.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have a care what you say, and mind
the Question I ask you, Were you there on the Sunday
in that Room where they say Sr. <font>Edmondbury Godfrey's</font>
Body was laid?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say that I was in that Room, but I
called in at the Door every Day, and I was the last up
every Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wild.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ile say that for thee, thou hast spoke
with more care then any of them all.
