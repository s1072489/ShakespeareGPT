</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Mistris Mary, Mistris Splay, and Brabo.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> prethee tell me <font>Brabo</font> , what Planet       
thinkst thou
gouernd at my conception, that I liue thus openly to the
world?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bra.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Planets raind at once, <font>Venus</font> thats you,
And <font>Mars</font> thats <font>I</font> , were in coniunction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Splay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prethee, prethee, in faith that coniunction
copulatiue, is that part of speech that I liue by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bra.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, to see the world, we swaggerers
That liue by oathes and big-mouth'd menaces,
Are now reputed for the tallest men:
He that hath now a black muchato
Reaching from eare to eare, or turning vp
<font> <foreign>Puncto reuerso</foreign> </font> , bristling towards the eye:
He that can hang two hansom tooles at his side,
Go in disguisde attire, weare Iron enough,
Is held a tall man and a souldier.
He that with greatest grace can sweare gogs zounds,
Or in a Tauerne make a drunken fray,
Can cheat at Dice, swagger in bawdie houses,
Weare veluet on his face, and with a grace
Can face it out with as <font>I</font> am a souldier.
He that can clap his sword vpon the boord
Hee's a braue man, and such a man am I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She that with kisses can both kil &amp; cure,
That liues by loue, that sweares by nothing else
But by a kisse, which is no common oath:
That liues by lying, and yet oft tels truth;
That takes most pleasure when she takes most paines:
Shee's a good wench my boy, and such am I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Splay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She that is past it, and praies for them that may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bra.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is an old Bawd as you are Mistris <font>Splay</font> .
<pagebreak id="D4R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Splay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O do not name that name, do you not know
That <font>I</font> could neuer endure to heare that name.
But if your man would leaue vs, <font>I</font> would read
The lesson that last night <font>I</font> promist you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> prethee leaue vs, we would be alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bra.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And will and must: if you bid me be gone,
<font>I</font> will withdraw, and draw on any he
That in the worlds wide round dare cope with me.
Mistris farewell, to none <font>I</font> neuer speake 
So kind a word. My salutations are,
Farewell and be hangd, or in the diuels name.
What they haue bene my many fraies can tell,
You cannot fight, therefore to you farwell. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Exit.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O this same swaggerer is the bulwark of my          
reputation,
But Mistris <font>Splay</font> , now to your lecture that you promist me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Splay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Daughter attend, for <font>I</font> will tell thee now
What in my yong daies I my selfe haue tried:
Be rul'd by me and <font>I</font> will make thee rich.
You God be praisde are faire, and as they say
Full of good parts, you haue bene often tried
To be a woman of good carriage,
VVhich in my mind is very commendable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is indeed. Forward good mother <font>Splay</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Splay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And as <font>I</font> told you, being faire, <font>I</font> wish
Sweet daughter you were as fortunate.
VVhen any sutor comes to aske thy loue,
Looke not into his words, but into his sleeue,
If thou canst learne what language his purse speakes,
Be rul'd by that, thats golden eloquence.
Mony can make a slauering tongue speake plaine:
If he that loues thee be deform'd and rich,
Accept his loue, gold hides deformitie.
Gold can make limping <font>Vulcan</font> walke vpright,
Make squint eyes looke strait, a crabd face looke smooth,
<pagebreak id="D4V" />
Guilds Copernoses, makes them looke like gold:
Fils ages wrinkles vp, and makes a face
As old as <font>Nestors</font> , looke as yong as <font>Cupids</font> .
If thou wilt arme thy selfe against all shifts,
Regard all men according to their gifts.
This if thou practise, thou when I am dead
Wilt say old mother <font>Splay</font> soft laid thy head.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter yong Arthur.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soft who comes here? begone good Mistris <font>Splay</font> ,
Of thy rules practise this is my first day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Splay.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God for thy passion what a beast am <font>I</font> ,
To scar the bird that to the net would flie. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>

Enuy, that all bones, that bare Anatomy, that Iack a Lent,
that ghost, that shadow, that Moone in the waine.

Had not grim <font>Malkin</font> stampt and star'd,
<font>Aminadab</font> had little car'd:
Or if in stead of this browne bill,
I had kept my mistris <font>Virga</font> still,
And he vpon an others back,
His points vntrust, his breeches slack:
My countenance he should not dash,
For I am expert in the lash.
But my sweet Lasse my loue doth flie,
Which shall make me by poyson die.
<font> <foreign>Per fidem</foreign> </font> , I will rid my life,
Either by poyson, sword, or knife. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Didst not thou say he was there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True mistris he was there, but I did not tel ye    
whe~,
He hath bin there diuers times, but not of late.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About your busines, here Ile sit and wait
His comming home, though it be nere so late.
Now once againe goe looke him at the Change,
Or at the Church with Sir <font>Aminadab</font> ,
<pagebreak id="E2V" />
Tis told me they vse often conference:
When that is done, get you to schoole againe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had rather plaie the trewant at home, then goe
seeke my M. at schoole: let me see what age am <font>I</font> , some
foure &amp; twentie, and how haue <font>I</font> profited, <font>I</font> was fiue yeare
learning to crish Crosse from great A. and fiue yeare
longer comming to F. <font>I</font> there I stucke some three yeare
before I could come to q. and so in processe of time <font>I</font> came
to e perce e, and comperce, and tittle, then <font>I</font> got to a. e.
i. o. u. after to our Father, and in the sixteenth yeare of
my age, and the fifteenth of my going to schoole, <font>I</font> am in
good time gotten to a Nowne, by the same token there
my hose went downe: then <font>I</font> got to a Verbe, there I
began first to haue a beard: the~ <font>I</font> came to <font> <foreign>Iste, ista,     
istud</foreign> </font> , there
my M. whipt me till he fetcht the blood, and so foorth: so
that now I am come the greatest scholler in the schoole:
for I am bigger then two or three of them. But I am gone,
farewell mistresse. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Exit.</font> </nonSpeech> 
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Anselme and Fuller.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ful.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Loue none at all, they will forsweare themselues,
And when you vrge them with it, their replies
Are, that <font>Ioue</font> laughes at Louers periuries.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You told me of a Iest concerning that,
<font>I</font> prethee let me heare it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ful.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That thou shalt.
My mistris in an humor had protested,
That aboue all the world she lou'd me best,
Saying with sutors she was oft molested,
And she had lodg'd her hart within my brest:
And sware (but me) both by her maske &amp; fan,
She neuer would so much as name a man.
Not name a man quoth I, yet be aduisde,
Not loue a man but me, let it be so:
You shall not think quoth she my thoughts disguisde,
<pagebreak id="E3R" />
In flattring language, or dissembling show:
<font>I</font> say againe, and <font>I</font> know what <font>I</font> do,
<font>I</font> will not name a man aliue but you.
Into her house <font>I</font> came at vnaware,
Her backe was to me and <font>I</font> was not seene,
<font>I</font> stole behind her till <font>I</font> had her faire,
Then with my hands <font>I</font> closed both her eyne,
She blinded thus, beginneth to bethinke her
Which of her Loues it was that did hood-winck her,
First she begins to guesse &amp; name a man
That <font>I</font> well knew, but she had knowne far better.
The next <font>I</font> neuer did suspect till than:
Still of my name <font>I</font> could not heare a letter,
Then mad, she did name <font>Robin</font> , and then <font>Iames</font> ,
Till she had reckoned vp some twentie names,
At length when she had counted vp her score,
As one among the rest she hit on mee:
<font>I</font> askt her if she could not recken more,
And pluckt away my hands to let her see.
But when she lookt back and saw me behind her
She blusht, and askt if it were <font>I</font> did blind her?
And since <font>I</font> sware both by her maske and fan,
To trust no she tongue, that can name a man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your great oath hath some exceptions:
But to our former purpose, yon is Mistris <font>Arthur</font> ,
We will attempt another kind of wooing,
And make her hate her husband if we can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ful.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But not a word of passion or of loue.
Haue at her now to trie her patience,
God saue you mistris.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are welcome sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ful.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> pray you wheres your husband?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Yon. Ar.</font> </comment> Not within.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who M. <font>Arthur</font> ? him <font>I</font> saw euen now
<pagebreak id="E3V" />
At mistris <font>Maries</font> the braue Curtizans.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wrong not my husbands reputatio~ so,
I neither can nor will beleeue you sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ful.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Poore gentlewoman how much <font>I</font> pittie you,
Your husband is become her only guest:
He lodges there, and daily diets there,
He riots, reuels, and doth all things,
Nay he is held the M. of misrule,
Mongst a most loathed and abhorred Crew:
And can you being a woman suffer this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, sir, I vnderstand you well inough,
Admit my husband doth frequent that house
Of such dishonest vsage, <font>I</font> suppose
He doth it but in zeale to bring them home
By his good counsell, from that course of sinne:
And like a Christian, seeing them astray
In the broad path that to damnation leades,
He vseth thither to direct their feete
Into the narrow way that guides to heauen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was euer woman guld so palpably?
But Mistris <font>Arthur</font> thinke you as you say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir what <font>I</font> think <font>I</font> think, and what I say
I would I could enioyne you to beleeue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith mistris <font>Arthur</font> I am sory for you,
And in good sooth, I wish it laie in me
To remedie the least part of these wrongs
Your vnkind husband daily profers you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are deceiu'd he is not vnkind,
Although he beare an outward face of hate,
His hart and soule are both assured mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie mistris <font>Arthur</font> , take a better spirit,
Be not so timerous to rehearse your wrongs,
<font>I</font> say your husband haunts bad company,
Swaggerers, cheaters, wanton Curtizans.
<pagebreak id="E4R" />
There he defiles his bodie, staines his soule,
Consumes his wealth, vndoes himselfe and you,
In danger of diseases, whose vilde names
Are not for any honest mouthes to speake,
Nor any chaste eares to receiue and heare.
O he will bring that face admir'd for beautie,
To be more loathed then a leaprous skin:
Diuorce your selfe now whilst the clouds grow black,
Prepare your selfe a shelter for the storme,
Abandon his most loathed fellowship:
You are yong mistris, will you loose your youth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tempt no more diuel, thy deformitie
Hath chaung'd it selfe into an angels shape,
But yet <font>I</font> know thee by thy course of speech:
Thou gets an apple to betray poore <font>Eue</font> ,
Whose outside beares a show of pleasant fruite,
But the vilde branch on which this apple grew,
Was that which drew poore <font>Eue</font> from Paradice.
Thy Syrens song could make me drowne my selfe,
But <font>I</font> am tyed vnto the mast of truth.
Admit my husband be inclin'd to vice,
My vertues may in time recall him home,
But if we both should desp'rate runne to sinne,
We should abide certaine destruction.
But hee's like one that ouer a sweet face
Puts a deformed vizard for his soule,
Is free from any such intents of ill:
Only to try my patience, he puts on
An vgly shape of black intemperance.
Therefore this blot of shame which he now weares,
I with my praiers will purge, wash with teares.

To imbrace it with a hempen rope,
Ile die no way till nature will me,

For <font>Ouid</font> said, and did not lie,

And hazard drowning in that purple sea.
So he that loues, must needs through blood and fire,
And do all things to compasse his desire.

And still with amorous talke she was saluted,
My artlesse speech with scripture was confuted.

My Spanish shooe was cut too broad at toe.

As in a glasse, the shadow of my loue:
When I would speake, her name intrudes it selfe
Into the perfect ecchoes of my speech.
And though my thought beget some other word,
Yet will my tongue speake nothing but her name:

First with this latest kisse I seale my loue.

O <font>I</font> would hide me, but <font>I</font> know not where;
Tush if it be a spirit, tis a good spirit,

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O tel me not my husband was ingrate,
Or that he did attempt to poyson me,
Or that he laid me here, and I was dead,
These are no meanes at all to win my loue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sweet Mistris, he bequath'd you to the earth,
You promis'd him to be his wife till death,
And you haue kept your promise, but now since
The world, your husba~d, &amp; your friends suppose
That you are dead, grant me but one request,
And I will sweare neuer to sollicite more,
Your sacred thoughts to my dishonest loue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So your demand may be no preiudise
To my chast name, no wrong vnto my husband,
No sute that may concern my Wedlock breach,
I yeeld vnto it, but to passe the bands of modestie &amp; chastitie,
First will <font>I</font> bequeath my selfe againe
Vnto this graue, and neuer part from hence,
Then taint my soule with blacke impuritie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take here my hand &amp; faithful hart to gage,
That I will neuer tempt you more to sinne:
This my request is, since your husband doates
Vpon a leaud lasciuious Curtezan,
Since he hath broke the bands of your chaste bed,
And like a murderer sent you to your graue,
Do but go with me to my mothers house,
There shall you liue in secret for a space,
Onely to see the end of such leaud lust,
And know the difference of a chaste wifes bed,
And one whose life is in all loosenesse led.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your mother is a vertuous Matron held,
<pagebreak id="H3V" />
Her counsell, conference, and companie,
May much auaile me, there a space Ile stay,
Vpon condition as you said before,
You neuer will moue your vnchaste sute more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My faith is pawnd, o` neuer had chaste wife,
A husband of so leaud and vnchast life. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>

These bristled hayres vpon my graue like chin

These Infant feathers of these rauens wings,
Were not once begunne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Spl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No indeed they were not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bra.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now in my two Muchatoes for a need,
Wanting a rope, I well could hang my selfe:
I prithee Mistris, for all my long seruice,
For all the loue that I haue borne thee long,
Do me this fauour now to marry me.

But peace, no more, here comes the silly foole
That we so long haue set our lime-twigs for,
Be gone, and leaue me to intangle him.

weeke, this moneth, this yeare?
This yeare said I? where haue you bene this age?
Vnto a Louer euery minute seemes time out of minde.
How should <font>I</font> thinke you loue me,
That can indure to stay so long from me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Yong Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In faith sweet heart I saw thee yesternight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I true, you did, but since you saw me not,
at twelue a clocke you parted from my house,
<pagebreak id="H4R" />
And now tis morning, and new strucken seuen.
Seuen houres thou staidst fro~ me, why didst thou so?
They are my seuen yeares Prentiship of woe.

That did inforce me from thee yesternight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I you are soone inforc'd, foole that I am,
To dote on one that nought respecteth me:
Tis but my fortune, I am borne to beare it,
And euerie one shall haue their destinie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Yong Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay weepe not wench, thou woundst mee
with thy teares.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a foole, and so you make me too,
These teares were better kept, then spent in waste,
On one that neither tenders them nor me:
What remedie, but if I chance to die,
Or to miscarrie with that I go withall,
Ile take my death that thou art cause thereof.
You told me, that when your wife was dead,
You would forsake all others, and take me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Yong Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told thee so, &amp; I will keep my word,
And for that end I came thus early to thee:
I haue procur'd a licence, and this night
We will be married in a lawlesse Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These newes reuiue me, &amp; do somewhat ease
The thought that was new gotten to my heart.
But shall it be to night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Yong Ar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> wench, to night. 
A sennet and odde dayes since my wife died
Is past alreadie, and her timelesse death,
Is but a nine daies talke, come go with me,
And it shall be dispatched presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay then I see thou louest me, &amp; I finde
By this last motio~, thou art growne more kinde.

<pagebreak id="H4V" />
And with the time increase, and thou shalt see,
The older <font>I</font> grow, the kinder <font>I</font> will bee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> so <font>I</font> hope it will, but as for mine,
That with my age shall day by day decline.
Come, shall we goe?

Whose beautie most admire, and all commend.
