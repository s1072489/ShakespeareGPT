</dialogue> <head>DIALOGUE I.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose <font>Child</font> are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your's.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why do you think so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because you teach me to call you <font>Father</font> ,
and are fond of me, and maintain me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis true, my Dear, I provide you Food
to satisfy your Hunger; Cloaths to cover you,
and keep you warm; a House to shelter you from
the Severities of the Weather; an easy Bed to sleep
on; a Variety of innocent Amusements to divert
you; and proper Advice and Physick to cure you
when you are not well. At my Cost you have
been properly attended in your most helpless
<pagebreak id="29" />
Infant State, when you could neither go nor stand,
nor tell your Wants; have been preserved from all
Sorts of Injuries, kept clean, and wholesome,
and healthful, and taught by Degrees to go, and
speak, and any Thing else you were capable of
learning, that might be useful to you. Now what
do you think induces me to do all this for you?
Did you ever do any Thing, or any Thing equivalent
to this, for me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. But I will do whatever I can for
you as long as I live, and whatever you would
have me do; and always love and honour you;
and shall never think I can make you Amends for
such Kindness to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You promise fair, and I hope will be
as good as your Word; and assure you, you shall
never be a Loser by such Dutifulness. Whatever I
require of you shall be as much for your own Good
as mine, and more; even those Things wherein I
may be obliged to deny your Inclinations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will my dear Father ever deny me any
Thing I have a mind to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not willingly, my Dear, but out of
Kindness to you. I have seen more of the World, and
the Consequences of Things than you; and may
perceive Danger, even to yourself, where you
apprehend none, but only Pleasure and Delight;
should I see you running headlong towards a deep
Pit, or Precipice, or Place where I knew were
wild Beasts or an infectious Distemper; would it not
be a real Kindness to stop you, tho' it were by
Violence, and ever so much against your Will?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The greatest Kindness you could do me;
and I will confide in the Wisdom, Experience, and
good Intentions of one who was born so long before
me; and from whom I have received already so
many indubitable Proofs of good Will.
<pagebreak id="30" />
</dialogue> <head>DIALOGUE II.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O My dear Papa, I have thought over
and over of what you said to me
Yesterday, and dreamt of it in the Night, and long
to talk with you again, and ask you Questions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Come then, my Child, what Question
have you to ask? I shall answer them with
Pleasure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You made me sensible how much I am
indebted to you for my Being, and Protection,
and innumerable Benefits, particularly during my
Infancy. Were you once a Child like me, and
had you such a Father to take Care of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I remember him with Pleasure,
tho' he died before you were born.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And your Father had a Father, I
suppose; and his Father, perhaps, the like before him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> True, my Dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But was it always so? When, and how did
this Relation, and Succession of Parents and
Children begin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It must of Necessity have had a 
Beginning, and it had so. That <font>Clock</font> you hear strike
one, then two, then three, <font>&amp;c.</font> at certain Distances
of Time, from Day to Day, did not always do so;
but was contrived, and made, and set on going,
some Years since, by an ingenious Artist, who
still looks after it, and keeps it in Order. And he
that contriv'd, and made all the World; the Sun,
Moon, and Stars of Heaven, that rise, and set,
and distinguish Night and Day; the Earth, and all
the Trees, and Plants, and Grass that grow out of
it; and all the Creatures that inhabit it; and Man
<pagebreak id="31" />
at the Head of them all; and preserves them all in
their Places, Courses, and Successions; he is the
first Origin, the <font>Supreme Father</font> of the whole
Universe; even <font>God</font> , who never had a Beginning, but
always was, always must be unchangeably the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! I am astonished at the Thought, and
yet it must be so. But where is this <font>Supreme
Father</font> ? Cannot I go to him, and see him, and
converse with him, as I do with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is he, Child! Where is he not!
He is every where; he is always present with you,
and with every one of his Children, and every one
of his Creatures; more nearly, more intimately so,
than it is possible for me to be with you. He
continually upholds and preserves every Faculty we have
of Action, Perception, Speech, or Thought, and
sees, and knows every Thing that passes in the
World; or in the very Heart of Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Does he know my Thoughts before I
speak them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Most assuredly he does; for he is the
Father of Spirits. He endowed you with the Power
of Thought, and constantly preserves every Faculty
of your Mind; and therefore knows every the least
Motion or Affection thereof.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You surprize me. I thought I had no
other Eye to stand in Awe of so much as your's; but
find there is one, who sees what you see not, even
my secret Thoughts; I cannot help being greatly
concerned about my Behaviour towards so great a
Being. I want to know more of him; what Power
he has to do me Good or Hurt; what are his
Dispositions towards me; what will be pleasing or
displeasing to him; wherein he resembles, and
wherein he may differ from you, my immediate
Father, whom I know, and love, and confide in.
<pagebreak id="32" />
But, in short, I scarce know what Questions to ask
you about him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will save my dear Child the Labour
of studying for Questions upon this Head, by
giving you as short and plain an Account as I can, of
what is most material for you to know concerning
him; and at the same Time answer any Questions
you may interpose as well as I can, and you are
able to understand Things. But this must be some
other Time, because my Business calls me off at
present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let it be soon, my dear Papa.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> God bless you.

</dialogue> <head>DIALOGUE III.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, my dear Child, I have a
leisure Hour at your Service: Can you
leave your Play, to talk on serious Subjects with your
Father?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I could not I should be very
unworthy of such a <font>Father</font> , and of such <font>Instructions</font> .
Besides, the Subject you are now by Promise to go
upon, is of all the Subjects the most engaging. To be
acquainted with another <font>Father</font> , even greater than
you, promises me new, and high Delight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You cannot promise yourself too much
from it. He is infinitely greater and better than I,
or any Man, or any Being besides himself; the
greatest, and the best of all Beings, and of Fathers.
He can do whatever he pleases; can make, or
destroy the Earth, the Sun, the World, in an Instant,
as easily as you can move a Finger: But he is as
good as he is wise and powerful. He consults and
<pagebreak id="33" />
delights in the Happiness and Perfections of his
Creatures. There is no Creature, not a Sparrow
or a Worm, but shares his Protection, Bounty,
Care, and Goodness. Whatever little Good, or
Protection you may seem to receive from me, or
any other Creature, comes ultimately, and chiefly
from him; nor can any Thing, or Person else,
be more than an Instrument in his Hand, of
conveying Benefits to you. He makes the Earth
to yield us Food; and makes that Food
wholesome, nourishing, and pleasant to us. 'Tis his
Wine, and Milk, and Meat we feed on; his
Wool and Flax that furnishes us with comfortable
and decent Garments. He causes us to breathe,
and live, and move; to sleep, and awake again;
or, as the Scriptures speak, <font>in him we live, and
move, and have our Being</font> . 'Tis for this Reason
you are taught to thank him for your Food, and
ask his Blessing on it; to commit yourself to his
Protection every Night, and thank him for it every
Morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And is he pleased with these my
Prayers and Praises?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if they come from your Heart; from
a grateful, humble, dutiful Sense of your
Dependance upon him; because such a Temper of Mind,
so cherished, kept up continually, and improved,
is for your Good; therefore he is pleased with it;
for no one can wish you so well as your Heavenly
Father doth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not I, nor you yourself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why does he wish me well?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because you are his Offspring, whom
he has made a reasonable Creature too, and so
much liker, and nearer to himself, than the Brute
Creatures; and yet he wishes well to all his
<pagebreak id="34" />
Creatures, in their Places, and does them good; he
designed them for Good, and obliges them to do one
another Good; and rational Creatures to do it of
Choice, and with Pleasure, as he himself does. As
God is every where, knows all Things, and can do
whatever he pleases in Heaven, and in Earth; so
he constantly over-rules all Things and Events, for
the Good of the whole, or the greatest Good; for
<font>He is good to all, his tender Mercies are over all
his Works</font> . His Goodness so infinitely exceeds
the Goodness of all <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: of a all</comment> other Beings, and all  
their
comparitively little Goodness is so entirely owing
to his, that our blessed Saviour might well say, <font>There
is none Good but one, that is God</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said I wou'd do every Thing in my
Power to serve, and please you, on Account of
your Goodness to me; but O! what do I then owe
to this best of Beings, my Heavenly Father, of
whom you tell me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Be sure you owe him the highest
possible Degree of Gratitude and Love; so to love
him, as to love nothing else in Comparison of him;
or to love every Thing else that is good chiefly
for his Sake, from whence, even from whose
Goodness, it proceeds; who makes it so good, and so
good to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would be very solicitous to please so
great and good a God and Father; and especially
not to displease him; and therefore want to know
wherein I may be liable ever to do that. Is he ever
angry, as you sometimes have been, when I or
any one else has done amiss?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No one can be so perfectly averse to
Evil as God is; and tho' he is not of like Passions
with us, is not angry in such a Way as to imploy
any Weakness, or Imperfection; yet may he be
said to be angry, and very angry too, with the
<pagebreak id="35" />
Wicked, or those who do amiss; and the Anger of
so great a Being must be very dreadful; and not less,
but more so (to an ingenuous Mind) for his
Goodness; for even his Anger arises from his
Goodness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can that be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> All Evil is naturally hurtful, not to
God, but to his Creatures, whom he wishes well,
and on that Account is most displeasing to him.
If you do amiss, you hurt yourself at least, and
perhaps others also; and this must needs displease
your Friend, who desires your highest Welfare,
and that of every other Being too, which your
Misconduct may possibly injure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is indeed the greatest Reason, that
can be, why I should fear to offend him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And it is a Reason, too, why you should
trust in him. For if you hurt not yourself, he will
never hurt you, nor suffer others to hurt you any
farther than he will turn it to your real Advantage,
and punish them for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I could be secure from their
injuring me any more, methinks I should be sorry to
have those who have injured me severely
punished.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You do well to cherish such a forgiving
Temper; and if you forgive your Enemy, and he
sincerely repent, God will forgive him likewise.
In that Case, his Repentance is Punishment
sufficient, and may give you the juster Pleasure, as it will
not only sufficiently avenge you, but also prove a
sure Means of reforming him, and doing him, in
the End, the greatest Good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since you have said so much about Evil,
pray inform me what is Evil, that I may know
precisely what will offend my heavenly Father, and
what, on the other Hand, he approves.
<pagebreak id="36" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Parent.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is a very pertinent and
important Enquiry, and, that I may answer it the more
distinctly, I will take another Opportunity for it,
having already over-stayed my Time. Farewell, my
Dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Farewell, Papa, and thank you for
spending so much of your precious Time upon
me.

</dialogue> <head>DIALOGUE IV.
BETWIXT THE MOTHER AND CHILD.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Mamma, where is my Father?
Is he gone from Home?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Dear, he went out this
Morning very early.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When will he return?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope in the Evening, at farthest; and
sooner, if he can dispatch his Business. Why do
you ask after him? But I know it is because you
love your Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do indeed, and honour him, and you too
very much, as I am in Duty and in Gratitude
bound. Methinks I see, even now, by my little 
Sister in your Arms, something of the Care and
Trouble you took with me before I was able to set
my Foot to the Ground, or help myself in the
least; since that I have been made sensible of your
<pagebreak id="37" />
continued Care and Kindness towards me, in
innumerable Instances; but in nothing else so much as
in the Pains you both take to instruct and form
my Mind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am glad, my Dear, you are
sensible of that, because you will be the likelier to
improve by such Instructions, the more you
apprehend the Kindness and Importance of them. But
why did you think your Father was gone Abroad?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because you perform'd Divine Service
in the Family this Morning; which you don't
use to do when he is at Home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> since you took such Notice who
officiated in that Service, I hope, my Dear, you went
yet farther, and took Notice also what was said,
and joined in it with the concurring Sentiments and
Desires of your own Heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I assure you, I did; and <font>prayed along
with you every Word, tho' I did not speak</font> ; and
after what my Dear Father has told me concerning
<font>God Almighty</font> , 'tis impossible I should ever hear
that Divine Being spoken of, or spoken to,
without being greatly concerned in it. I heard this
Morning, to my Grief, some Children in the Street
use the Name of God with great Freedom,
Irreverence, and Indecency: Father forgive them
<pagebreak id="38" />
(thought I) they know not what they do; but
what Parents must they have the while? And how
distinguishedly bless'd am I in both mine? Sure
there are no other Parents like you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Many, I hope, Child, that are much
better; and yet I am afraid there are more who are
worse. Do you pray daily to God to dispose
Parents more universally to instil into their Children
early the Knowledge and Fear of God; and to bless
our Endeavours of this Kind for you. -- O! here is
your Papa returned already.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am glad, then God has prosper'd him
in the Business he went about, perhaps, Mamma, in
Answer to your Prayers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And his own and your's too, perhaps.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it possible he should have any
Regard <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Ragard</comment> to such a Child's Desires as mine?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mother.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, or to the Cries, or Groans, or
Sighs, or other Tokens of Distress, made by
Creatures incapable of Thought, or Speech, or
conscious Application to him, as you are: But
let us go welcome your Father Home.

</dialogue> <head>DIALOGUE V.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, Sir, will you instruct me how
to behave aright?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will, my Dear. <font>To behave aright is
to behave suitably to the Nature, Uses, Relations,
Rank and Character of every Person, and every
<pagebreak id="39" />
Thing that is, or can be concerned in our Behaviour,
as well as to our own</font> ; <omission type="sentence" />
<comment type="compiler">FATHER'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would first know my Duty to God.
<pagebreak id="40" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In one Sense all Duty, is Duty towards
God; as you may apprehend from what I have
already said. But there are some Duties more
immediately and distinctly owing to him; as that
you set him always before you; consider him as
always present with you; think of him with the
profoundest Reverence, and Respect, Trust,
Delight, and Joy; Thankfulness for his Mercies,
and Resignation to his Will; and exercise and
cherish this Regard of your Heart to him, by frequent,
affectionate, and humble Worship of him: That
before all Things you obey him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What rather than you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if I should command you any
Thing contrary to, or inconsistent with his
Commands; which I hope I never shall, and then your
Obedience to me will be Obedience to him, which 
is the Perfection of filial Duty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What are his Commands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The deliberate Determination of our own
Judgment and Conscience concerning what we
ought to do, and to forbear, is <font>his Command, or
Law written in our Heart</font> ; and for our yet better,
and readier Direction, we <font>Christians</font> have his
<font>revealed, written Precepts</font> which I shall instruct you
in more particularly another Time, which <font>Jesus
Christ</font> has summed up in a few comprehensive
Words, that will give you at present a general Idea
of them, namely, <font>That we love the Lord our God
with all our Heart and Soul, and Mind, and
Strength; and our Neighbour as ourself</font> : By
which you see our Duty to others, and ourselves
too, is to be done as Duty to God, being included
in his Commands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is there any other Duty or Regard I
owe to God?
<pagebreak id="41" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, that you imitate, as much as
possible, his moral Excellencies; his Uprightness,
Truth, and Goodness. This is paying him a due
Regard, to make him your highest, choicest
Pattern, and it is at the same Time a Duty you owe
yourself, to make a right Use of such a Help to
Virtue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can I be under Obligations to myself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly, very great ones; and if you
neglect them, or act contrary to them, you'll find
something within you will call you to a severe
Account; I mean your own affronted <font>Reason, and
Conscience</font> . God has given you these high Powers,
and thereby raised you above the Brute Creation,
and to a Life far above the mere Animal Life. You
have Appetites and Passions in common with the
Brutes; but you have also a rational Soul to
direct, and govern those Appetites, and Passions. If
you thus use your Reason, you'll improve it; but
if you neglect it, you'll weaken it, and give an
unnatural, and destructive Force and Strength
to your animal, brutal Appetites and Passions,
and degrade yourself into something much worse
than a <font>Brute</font> , and much more miserable; nothing
can be more degrading, more disgraceful, and
detestable, than for a reasonable Creature not to be
Master of himself, and his own Appetites and
Passions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Respects am I, or any other
Person, liable to be deficient in this 
Self-Government?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In many Instances. Whenever your
<font>Desires, Fears, Aversions</font> , or <font>Resentments</font> , are much
excited, you will be liable to disregard the still,
small Voice of <font>Reason</font> , or even the warmer
Remonstrances, and Expostulations of <font>Conscience</font> .
<pagebreak id="42" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you give me any particular
Instances?
<comment type="compiler">FATHER'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because it will weaken your Reason,
and Resolution, and heighten such Appetites and
Passions into a kind of <font>Madness</font> , or <font>Frensy</font> . Have
<pagebreak id="43" />
you never observed little Master, -- what violent
Passions he goes into, if he may not have, and do
whatever he list; or seen our unhappy Neighbour
-- drunk in the Street?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but I always took them, and others
like them, to be <font>Fools</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You judge, indeed, very right: They
are the worst of <font>Fools</font> ; but then they are not
naturally so, but become so by indulging, or being
indulged in their Humours. They have Reason
as well as you, or I, but have lost the Use of it,
and you may easily do the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope I never shall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope so too; but then it must be by
proper Care. Your Mother and I have hitherto
endeavoured to guard you against any dangerous
Efforts of Appetite, Humour or Passion; but
you must learn to guard yourself against them by
that Time you go out into the World, or we may
be taken from you by Death, and you owe thus
much to yourself, to your Interest, and Comfort,
Reputation, and Respect among Men, and to him
that made you, and gave you Understanding for
this Purpose. Both God and Man, and all
intellectual Beings, must look down with the utmost
Contempt upon a Wretch, that has lost that
Government of himself, he was once endowed with;
and even he himself, if ever he thinks at all, must
despise, and loath, and be a Torment to himself.
Therefore, my Dear Child, think well of this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Farewell.
<pagebreak id="44" />
</dialogue> <head>DIALOGUE VI.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you thought of what I said
to you last?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have, and prayed to God to be the
Guardian of my Understanding as long as I live,
and to continue long to me the Benefit of your's,
and my Dear Mother's excellent Instructions, and
Example. But you intimated, that there were
Duties owing to others, as well as more immediately
to God and myself. What may these be?
<comment type="compiler">FATHER'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="45" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! I long to exercise, and shew such a
Sweetness and Greatness of Mind as this.
<comment type="compiler">FATHER'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="46" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All these Duties you have mentioned,
or hinted at, to <font>God, ourselves, or others</font> , are highly
reasonable at first View. Methinks no-body should
ever act contrary to them, at least, I hope, I never
shall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Let not my Dear Child, however, be
too secure, because many a very promising Person
has failed in his Duty in such Instances, and to
such a Degree, as not even themselves could once
have expected, or believed they would have done
some Time before-hand. When the Prophet of the
Lord, with Tears in his Eyes, foretold what
Cruelties <font>Hazael</font> would commit on the Children of
<font>Israel</font> ; burn and demolish their Cities; slay their
young Men with the Sword; dash their Children;
and rip up their Women with Child; <font>Hazael's</font>
Answer was, Is thy Servant a Dog, that he should
do this? Yet such a Dog he proved, after he had
first murder'd his Sovereign, and usurped his
Throne. When <font>our Lord Jesus Christ</font> foretold his
Disciple <font>Peter</font> , just before his last Suffering, <font>This
Night wilt thou deny me thrice; Peter</font> made
Answer, <font>Tho' I should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee</font> : But he did before the next Morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These Instances are surprizing, and
alarming indeed. But what should ever induce me
to act a Part I at present so much, and so justly
abhor, or forsake the fair, and flowery Paths
of Virtue?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Father.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will take another Time to lay before
my Dear Child the principal Dangers of this Kind
for your timely Warning. In the mean while,
think of the <font>Beauty of Virtue</font> , and set your Heart
upon it. God bless you.

   <nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I Am now to inform my Dear Child of
the manyfold Dangers you are
encompassed with, of gradually impairing, and
loseing that Innocence, and those virtuous Principles,
of which you seem at present happily possessed, that
being <font>fore-warned</font> , you may be <font>fore-armed</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For that very Purpose I desire to know
them, and hope I shall make that Use of the
Information.

<pagebreak id="48" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But it seems easy to prevent all this by
never letting loose the Reins.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> True, my Dear, that is the most
effectual Way, and you may think it easy at
present to deny, and govern those Appetites, and
Passions, which <font>your Parents</font> have hitherto had a
watchful Eye over, and kept under the best
Regimen they could. Now that Care must devolve
by Degrees upon yourself, and if you steadily
proceed, you will find it easy still, and pleasant. But
if this Care and Government be ever remitted, it
may become very difficult, and next to
impossible to recover it. There is scarce a more useful,
or comfortable Thing than <font>Fire</font> , or more easily
managed, within proper Bounds, kindled, or
extinguished, increased, or diminished, by
applying, or with-holding Fewel; but if too much
increased, or neglected, and let to get hold of the
Building, it may soon become too vehement to be
suppressed, and consume the stateliest House or
Town to Ashes. Such is the Quality, very nigh,
of the human Appetites and Passions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It would be base and foolish indeed in
me to lose that Government of myself, which <font>God</font>
and <font>you</font> have made so easy to me. If this is all
the Danger, tho' it be considerable, I hope I am
in a fair Way to escape it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are, thank God, but yet, be not
secure. This is not all the Danger by a great
deal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then let me know the worst.
<comment type="compiler">FATHER'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="50" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! my dear Father, you make me
tremble too, least such a Succession, such a
Complication of Temptations should, in some
unguarded Moment, overcome me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This Fear of your's revives my Heart,
and will by the Grace of God preserve your
Virtue. Treat it as you would your <font>Guardian Angel</font> ,
be ever very regardful of its alarms; for they are
of the utmost Necessity to your Safety.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But why has God exposed the Virtue
of his poor Creatures to such <font>Attacks</font> and <font>Dangers</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> For the confirming, strengthening and
exalting of it. The most glorious Triumphant
Creature-Virtue, is <font>victorious Virtue</font> , and the more,
greater, and compleater its Victories, the more
confirmed, triumphant, and glorious it is. But
Victory implies preceding Combat, and the
greatest Victories are those over the most formidable
<pagebreak id="51" />
Opposition, and that succeed the hardest Conflicts.
Be alarmed therefore, but do not murmur at any
such Trials as these any more than needlesly run
into them, leave God to chuse your's; and along
with your greatest possible Caution and Resolution,
seek, and trust in him to bring you safely, and
honourably off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But now another Apprehension comes
into my Mind, seizes, and almost sinks my
Spirits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What can that be, Child?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fear least I have already broken thro'
the sacred Bounds of my Duty, and so lost my
<font>Innocence</font> and <font>Virtue</font> . Some Words and Actions
of my past Life, as well as secret Workings of my
Heart, appear to me not so perfectly agreeable to
the excellent Rules you have taught me, as I could
wish; nor have I Ignorance to plead, tho' not
then so well instructed as since: For, well I
remember, at the very Instant, something within me
smote me, and suggested I did amiss. As I have
already offended God, I fear he should abandon
me, and then I am undone, nor do I know how
he will deal with me for my past Faults.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> There is <font>Forgiveness</font> with God for
worse Sinners than you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Child.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would willingly hope so; but are you
sure of that; or do you only hope as I do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Father.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am very sure, and doubt not to
make you so too, when I can be at Leisure to talk
with you again on these Heads.
