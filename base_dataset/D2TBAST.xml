</dialogue><nonSpeech>Betweene eight and nine a clocke in the
morning (the 14. of Iune) the Lords being sett in 
their places in the said Court of 
Starre-chamber, and casting their eyes upon the Prisoners,
then at the Barr, S. Iohn Finch (chiefe Justice
of the Common Pleas) began to speake after
this manner.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sr. John Finch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had thought Mr. Prynne had had no     
eares, but me thinkes hee
hath eares; </dialogue><nonSpeech>which caused many of the Lords to take the stricter 
view of him; and for their better satisfaction, the Usher of the 
Court was commaunded to turne up his haire, and shew his eares: 
Upon the sight whereof the Lords were displeased they had beene
formerly no more cutt off; and cast out some disgracefull words of 
him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>To which Mr. Prynne replied;</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords,     
there is never a one of 
your Honours, but would be sorry to have your eares as mine 
are.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>The Lord Keeper replied againe;</nonSpeech><dialogue> In good   
faith hee is somewhat 
sawcy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> J hope </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said Mr. Prynne) </nonSpeech><dialogue> your Honours    
will not be offended, I
pray God give you eares to heare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The busines of the day </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said the Lord      
Keeper) </nonSpeech><dialogue> is to proceed 
on the Prisoners at the Barr.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M. <font>Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Mr. Prynne then humbly desired the Court to    
give him leave to 
make a motion or two, which being graunted, he mooves.
   First, that their Honours would be pleased to accept of a crosse 
Bill against the Prelates, signed with their owne hands, being that
which stands with the Iustice of the Court, which he humbly 
craved, and so tendred it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for your crosse Bill, it is not the        
busines of the day; Hereafter 
if the Court shall see just cause, and that it favours not of        
Libelling,
wee may accept of it; for my part I have not seene it, but have 
heard somewhat of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope your Honours will not refuse it, being   
it is on his 
Majesties behalfe; wee are his Majesties Subjects, and therefore     
require 
the Iustice of the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But this is not the busines of the day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhy then, My Lords, I have a second motion,   
which I humbly 
pray your Honours to graunt; which is, That your Lordships will 
be pleased to dismisse the Prelates, here now sitting from having 
any voyce in the censure of this cause, (being generally knowne 
to be Adversaries) as being no way agreeable with equity or 
reason, that they who are our Adversaries, should bee our Iudges: 
Therefore wee humbly crave they may be expunged out of the 
Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In good faith its a sweet motion, is't not?   
Herein you are 
become Libellous. And if you should thus Libell all the Lords and
Reverend Iudges, as you doe the most Reverend Prelates, by this 
your Plea, you would have none to passe sentence upon you for 
your Libelling, because they are parties.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Under correction (My Lord) this doth not hold; 
Your Honour 
need not putt that for a certainty, which is an uncertainty; we have
nothing to say to any of your Honours, but onely to the
Prelates.
<pagebreak id="5" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, proceed to the busines of the day; Read 
the Information.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Which was read, being very large; and these five Bookes annexed
thereunto (viz.) a Booke of Dr. Bastwicks written in Latin.
   The second, a little Booke, intituled, Newes from Ipswich. The
third intitled, A Divine Tragedy, recording Gods fearefull
judgements on Sabbath breakers. The fourth Mr. Burtons Booke,
intituled, An Apology of an Appeale to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, with two Sermons for God and the King, preached on the fifth
of November last. The fifth and last Dr. Bastwickes Letany.
   The Kings Counsell (being five) tooke each of them a severall
Booke, and descanted there at the Barre upon them according
to their pleasure.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Keeper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You heare Gentlemen wherewith you are      
charged; and now,
least you should say, you cannot have liberty to speake for your
selves, the Court gives you leave to speake what you can, with
these conditions:
   First, that you speake within the bounds of modesty.
   Secondly, that your speeches be not Libellous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Prisoners.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>They all three answered, they hoped so to order  
their speech as
to be free from any immodest or Libellous speaking.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then speake a Gods name, and shew cause why   
the Court should
not proceed in Censure (as taking the cause <font> <foreign>pro confesso</foreign> </font> ) 
against you.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Honourable good Lords, such a day of the    
moneth there came
a Subpoena from your Honours, to enter my appearance in this
Court; which being entred, I tooke forth a coppy of the
Information, which being taken, J was to draw my Answer, which I
endeavoured to doe, but being shutt up close prisoner, I was deserted
of all meanes, by which I should have done it; for I was no sooner
served with the Subpoena, but I was shortly after shutt up close
prisoner, with suspention of pen, inke and paper; which close
imprisonment did eate up such a deale of my time, that I was hindred
the bringing in of my Answer: You did assigne me Counsell, 'tis
true, but they neglected to come to me, and I could not come to
them, being under lock and key: Then upon motion in Court, yee
gave me liberty to goe to them; but then presently after that
motion (J know not for what cause, nor upon whose commaund) I
was shutt up againe: And then I could not compell my Counsell
to come to me, and my time was short, and I had neither pen nor
inke, nor Servant to do any thing for me, for my Servant was then
also kept close prisoner under a Pursevants hands; This was to put
impossibilities upon mee. Then upon a second motion for pen and
inke (which was graunted me) I drew up some Instructions, and
in a fortnight time sent 40 sheetes to my Counsell; suddainly after
I drew up 40 sheetes more, and sent to them; My Lord, I did
nothing but by the advise of my Counsell, by whom I was ruled in the
drawing up of all my answer, and payd him twice for drawing it,
and some of my Counsell would have set their hands to it. Here is
my Answer, I tender it upon my oath, which your Lordships
cannot deny with the Iustice of the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wee can give you a President, that this Court  
hath proceeded
&amp; undertake~ a cause <font> <foreign>pro confesso</foreign> </font> for not putting in an    
Answer in six
dayes; you have had a great deale of favour shewed in affording
you longer time, and therefore the Court is free from all calumny
or aspersion, for rejecting your Answer not signed with the
Counsels hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But one word or two, my Lords, I desire your   
Honours to heare
me; I put a case in law, that is often pleaded before your Lordships,
one man is bound to bring in two witnesses; if both or one of them
faile, that hee cannot bring them in, doth the Law (my Lords)
<pagebreak id="8" />
make it the mans act? You assigned me two Counsellors; one of
them fayled, I cannot compell him; Here he is now before you, let
him speake, if I have not used all my endeavours to have had him
signed it (which my other Counsell would have done, if this
would have set his hand to it with him) and to have put in long
since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Counsell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, there was so long time spent ere I   
could doe any thing, 
after I was assigned his Counsell, that it was impossible his Answer 
could be drawne up in so short a time as was allotted; for after long 
expectation, seeing he came not to mee, I went to him, where I 
found him shut up close prisoner, so that I could not have accesse 
to him; Whereupon I motioned to the Lieftenant of the Tower, to 
have free liberty of speech with him co~cerning his answer, vvhich 
being graunted me, I found him very vvilling and desirous to 
have it dravvne up, vvhereupon J did moove in this Court for pen 
&amp; paper, vvhich vvas graunted, the vvhich he no sooner had gotte~, 
but he set himself to dravv up Instructions, and in a short time, sent
me 40 sheetes; and soone after I received 40 more; but I found the 
Ansvver so long, and of such a nature, that J durst not set my hand 
to it, for feare of giving your Honours distast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, I did nothing, but according to the  
direction of my 
Counsel, only I spake mine ovvne vvords; my ansvver vvas dravvne 
up by his consent, it vvas his ovvne act, and hee did approove of it; 
and if he vvill be so base a Covvard, to doe that in private vvhich 
he dares not acknovvledge in publick, I vvill not such a sinne lye 
on my conscience, let it rest vvith him. Here is my Ansvver, vvhich 
though it be not signed vvith their hands, yet here I tender it upon 
my oath, vvhich you cannot in Iustice deny.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But Mr. Prynne, the Court desires no such     
long Ansvver; Are you
guilty or not guilty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Pryn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My good Lord, I am to ansvver in a defensive   
vvay, Is here any
one, that can vvitnes any thing against me? Let him come in. The
Law of God standeth thus; that a man is not to be condemned, but
under the mouth of two or three witnesses. Here is no witnesse
comes in against me, my Lord, neither is there in all the Informatio~
one clause that doth particularly fall on me, but onely in generall,
there is no Booke laid to my charge. And shall I be condemned
<pagebreak id="9" />
for a particular act, when no occusation of any particular act can be
brought against me? This were most unjust and wicked. Here I
tender my answere to the Information upon my oath; My Lord,
you did impose impossibilities upon me, I could doe no more then
I was able.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well hold your peace, your answer comes too   
late. Speake you
Dr. Bastwicke.
<comment type="compiler">DR. BASTWICK'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED. HE ASKS TO HAVE HIS LONG  
ANSWER READ.</comment>
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Keeper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But this is not the busines of the day;    
VVhy brought you not in
your Answer in due time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dr. Bastwike.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, a long time since I tendred it   
to your Honour, I
failed not in any one particular: And if my Counsell be so base and
cowardly, that they dare not signe it for feare of the Prelates (as I
can make it appeare) therefore have I no Answer? My Lord, here
is my Answer, which though my Counsell out of a base spirit, dare
not set their hands unto, yet J tender it upon my oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But Mr. Dr. you should have beene briefe; you 
tendred in too
large an Answer, which (as J heard) is as Libellous as your Bookes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D. Bastw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, it is not Libellous though       
large, J have none to
answer for me but my selfe, and being left to my selfe, I must plead
my conscience in answer to every circumstance of the
information.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you Mr. Dr. are you guilty, or not   
guilty? Answer yea
or no, you needed not to have troubled your self so much about so
large an Answer.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D. Bastwicke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know, none of your Honours have read my 
Booke; And can
you with the Iustice of the court, condemne me before you know
what is writen in my bookes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to that was read to you even now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D. Bast.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, he that read it did so murther the    
sence of it, that had
I not knowne, what <font>I</font> had writen, I could not tell what to have
made of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to the other sentence read to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D. Bast.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was none of mine, I will not father that  
which was none
of my owne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Dorset.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you send that booke, as now it is,   
to a Noble mans
house together with a Letter directed to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D. Bast.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea my Lord, I did so, but withall you may see 
in my Epistle set
before the booke, I did at first disclaime what was not mine; I sent
my Booke over by a Dutch Merchant, who it was that wrote the
addition I doe not know, but my Epistle set to my Booke, made
manifest what was mine, and what was not; and I cannot justly
suffer for what was none of mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Arund</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, you heare by his owne speech, the     
cause is taken <font> <foreign>pro
confesso</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, you say true my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D. Bast.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My noble Lord of Arundell, I know you are a    
noble Prince in
Israel, &amp; a great Peere of this Realme; There are some honourable
Lords in this Court, that have beene forced out as combatants in a
single duell; it is betweene the Prelates and us, at this time as
betweene two that have appointed the feild. The one being a coward
goes to the Magistrate, &amp; by vertue of his Authority disarmes the
other of his weapons, &amp; gives him a Bullrush, and then challenges
him to fight. If this be not base cowardice, I know not what
belongs to a Souldier. This is the case betweene the Prelates and us,
they take away our weapons (our Answers) by vertue of your
Authority, by which we should defend our selves, and yet they bidd
us fight. My Lord, doth not this savour of a base cowardly spirit?
I know, my Lord, there is a Decree gone forth (for my Sentence
was passed long since, to cut of our eares.
<pagebreak id="12" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Keeper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who shall knovv our Censure, before the    
Court passe it? Doe
you prophesy of your selves?
<comment type="compiler">DR. BASTWICK'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED. AGAIN HE ASKS THE COURT TO READ

<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Dr. I thought you would be angrie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dr. Bast.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, you are mis-taken, I am not       
angrie nor passionate,
all that I doe presse is, that you would be pleased to peruse my
Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, hold your peace. Mr. Burton, what say   
you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Burton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My good Lords, your Honours (it should      
seeme) doe determine
to Censure us, and take our cause <font> <foreign>pro confesso</foreign> </font> , although  
we have
laboured to give your Honours satisfaction in all things: My Lords,
what you have to say against my Booke, I confesse I did write it,
yet did I not any thing out of intent of Commotion or Sedition: I
delivered nothing, but what my Text ledd me too, being chosen to
suite with the day, namely the fifth of November; the words were
these, &amp;c.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Burton, I pray stand not naming Texts of  
Scripture now,
we doe not send for you to preach, but to answer to those things
that are objected against you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Burt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have drawne up my Answer to my      
great paines and
charges, which Answer was signed with my Counsels hands, and
received into the Court, according to the rule and Order thereof.
And I did not thinke to have beene called this day to a Censure,
but have had a legall proceeding by way of Bill and Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Answer was impertinent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Burt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Answer (after it was entred into the Court) 
was referred to
the Judges, but by what meanes I doe not know, vvhither it be
impertinent, and what cause your Lordships had to cast it out, I     
knovv
not. But after it vvas approoved of, and received, it vvas cast out
as an impertinent Ansvver.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Finch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Judges did you a good turne to make it    
impertinent, for it
was as Libellous as your Booke, so that your Answer deserved a
Censure alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat say you Mr. Burton, are you guilty, or  
not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Burton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire you not onely to peruse my 
Booke, here and
there but every passage of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Burton, time is short, are you guilty, or 
not guilty? VVhat
say you to that which was read? Doth it become a Minister to
deliver himself in such a rayling and scandalous way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Burton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In my judgement, and as I can proove it, it  
was neither rayling
nor scandalous, J conceive that a Minister hath a larger liberty the~
alwayes to goe in a milde straine: I being the Pastor of my people,
whom I had in charge, and was to instruct, J supposed it was my
duety to informe them of those innovations that are crept into the
Church, as likewise of the danger and ill consequence of them: As
for my Answer, yee blotted out what yee would, and then the rest
which made best for your owne ends, you would have to stand;
And now for mee to tender onely what will serve for your owne
turnes, and renounce the rest, were to desert my cause, which
before I will doe, or desert my conscience, I will rather desert my
body, and deliver it up to your Lordships to doe with it, what you
will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Keeper</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a place where you should crave mercy  
and favour, Mr.
Burton, and not stand upon such termes as you doe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Burt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There wherein I have offended through humane   
frailty, I crave
of God and Man pardon: And I pray God, that in your Sentence,
you may so Censure us, that you may not sinne against the Lord.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Thus the prisoners desiring to speake a little more for
themselves, were commaunded to silence. And so the Lords proceeded
to Censure. <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Censnre</comment> </nonSpeech>
