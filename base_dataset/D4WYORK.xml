upon Tuesday the 18th, hee was in company with Lord
Egglington, Mr. Thomas Maddox, and Mr. Tho. Derby, att the signe

upp dise and a box, which hee did, and soe they two fell to a

hee said), and then my Lord plaid upon the tick, and had lost
50 <font>s.</font> to him; but the dise came into my Lord's hands, and he
wan the 50 <font>s.</font> back, and 20 <font>s.</font> more, which he demanded Maddox

his hand upon the moneys that was upon the table; and the said
Maddox paid him. Upon which my Lord told him hee was a

beleive that Maddox was sett att the time of the first passe
makeing. And then this informant stept in and laid hold on my Lord
and putt him from Mr. Maddox, who followed my Lord and gott 
hold of my Lord's wigg. And in that bussell he supposes he
gott his wound in the thigh. Then this informant drove them
into a corner of the roome that hee might have the better 
advantage to part him and Maddox, whoe pulling at my Lord's

 <head> <comment type="editor">CCXXXV. JOHN REED AND ANOTHER. FOR BURGLARY.</comment> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>July 14, 1683. Before Peter Hudson, Mayor of Doncaster,
and Thomas Lee. <font>Mary, wife of John Oddy, of Rossington bridge
end</font> , saith, that the taller man, who calls himselfe by the name of
John Reed, came to her house yesterday about noone (this
deponent and her husband keeping a publique house att Rossington
bridge), and pretended to stay for some company to call of him
there; but, noe body calling of him, this deponent used 
arguaments for him to bee gone, saying they had noe lodging for him.
Hee still alledged that the said company would come, and that
hee must have lodging there, for that they would call either that
night or next morninge. This deponent was over perswaded to
lett him have lodging. And in the night, about one or two a
clocke, the lesser man, who calls himselfe by the name of John
Squire, came to the house, and called and knocked att the dores
and asked for a pott of ale. She refuseing to open the dores, hee
threatened to breake the windows, and asked if they had noe
lodgers in the house. She told him &quot;Noe.&quot; He replyed they
had one, a young man, and then called, &quot;Jack!&quot; Upon which
the lodger rose and spoake to him out of the window, and the
lesser man asked him if hee would goe with him, and hee answered
&quot;Yes.&quot; After much noise and stirr this deponent was forced to
open the chamber dore, where the lodger laid, and hee came down
and opened the outward dore to the other, whoe then came into
the house togeather, and called for ale and tobacco. When they
had drunke the ale, the taller man locked the dore, and the lesser
man seized upon a boy, called Francis Chambers, apprentice to
this deponent's husband, who filled them ale, and told him G--d
--- him, if hee did not tell him where the money lay hee would
run him through, as the boy informed this deponent. And the 
boy escapeing from him, they both came into the roome where
this deponent and her husband lay, the lesser man haveing his
sword drawn, and severall times threatened this deponent and her
husband to kill them, unless they would tell them where their
money was. Whereupon this informant told them that they had
noe money in the house. Hee told them that they had, and
swore, and offered his sword att them, and said hee would run
them through. Shee told them that, if they would save their
lives, they should have all they had. Whereupon this deponent
<pagebreak id="257" />
gave them their keys, but they, alledging they could not open the
locks, forced her to rise and open the locks and deliver them their
money, which was about 12 <font>s.</font> They swore that there was more
money in the house, and that they had lately sold land, and
received for itt fifty pounds, which they would have, or else swore
they would kill them, and searched all the house and chests for
itt. And when they could not find itt, they retorned and made
a thrust att this deponent's husband, and pricked him in the side;
which hee, endeavouringe to putt by, cutt his hand upon the
sword. Whereupon this deponent catched hold of the raper, and,
to prevent mischife, bent itt. Then they went out of the house,
and locked the dore after them, and, shortly after, came back
againe, and searched the house againe, and forced this deponent
to give them all the money shee had in her pockett, which was
about 3 <font>s.</font> in a little wood box. Dureing all this, Francis       
Chambers,

</dialogue> <head> <comment type="editor">CCXLII. EDMUND APPELBY. FOR SEDITIOUS WORDS.</comment> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>Nov. 20, 1684. Before Wm. Bridgeman, Esq. Memorandum,
that, one day about the latter end of winter or beginning of the
spring 1677-8, Edmund Appelby was drinking pretty briskly in
the house of William Orfeur, and was using severall diswasive
arguments, most of them consisting of ambiguous terms, viz., from
Wm. Orfeur, his keeping or managing any farm, or any other of
<pagebreak id="266" />
that perswasion, as a reputed Papist, &amp;c. And, att severall times
before, in Edmund Appelby his own house, had made use of strong
sophisticall arguments to the disparagement of monarchichall
government of England. As alsoe by justifying the death of the
late King, Charles the First, to have been deserving, as a combiner
with and intentionary introducer of Popery. And that his
murdering his subjects in Ireland deserved as many deaths to him as
he had haires of his head, if possibly he could have had so many
lives to have lost, being worse then the massacry of France. As
also that this Charles the Second was going the same rode, and
had made further progress in the same, and such like matters, and
consequently better deserved to undergoe the same punishment
then his father. And that to his knowledge he would as sure gett
itt, as he had done that was gone, before the expiracion of Wm.
Orfeur his four years lease, which was then within less then 13 or
14 months or thereabouts. And, therefore,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I advise you,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
Appelby to Orfeur,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;to look to yourself, for as soon as God sends
us the King's business done, there will not one Papist be 
permitted to be within the compass of the sea.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>And withall he
threatned that he should not speak of it, for being none but their
two selves, if he would be so ingratefull for his kindness to
discover him, he would both deny it and sue him for a slander.
But so it was that Wm. Orfeur his servant heard the same and
more than he could remember, which of late she voluntarily 
discovered to him: and signified the same by the specificall token
that above or a litle after that juncture of time a violent wind
blew over her litle child, then about four years old, with such
force against a great stone, that it had almost bled to death. And
in that passion for the child she cursed all traytors, either by word
or deed, or any that bare with them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And the said Edmund Appelby further intimated to Wm.
Orfeur that if it was his fortune to have the same power in the 
Commonwealth of England, as formerly he had in Oliver's time,
as he then said he had often formerly told Wm. Orfeur in Mr.
Menel's case of Kilvington, when he was a superintendant to the
sequestrators of the delinquents' estates, which indeed he did at
severall times before notifie to the said Wm. Orfeur, that then he
would have a dispensation for the litle man, meaning Wm. Orfeur,
for his banishment (but not from Rome, he said by way of
derision, &amp;c.) if he would be kind to him in surrendering of a lease
which he then had.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Memorandum, that James Appelby, about 15 or 16 months
after, in the year 1679, when Wm. Orfeur and his servants
demanded a gun from him which he kept and detained without
<pagebreak id="267" />
leave, his answer was, that he had authority to keep a gun, but
the Papists had none, neither for gun or other weapons. But
then a litle time after it happened that one of the said servants
asked him againe for the gune, and by what authority he
detained it, whose answer was, by vertue of the law and severall
acts of Parliament which was in force against Papists bearing or
wearing of arms. And the said Wm. Orfeur being nigh to the
said servant, (though not in James Appelby his view,) prompted 
him to ask whether he had the King's commission to put such
laws in execucion against the Papists or no. His answer was,
&quot;The King! no! he had better warrant then either King or
Papist. He had the fundamentall laws of the kingdom for his
warrant, and hop'd in few days now that the Commonwealth of
England should be once up againe, and should gett their hearts
all well eas'd of this King and the Papists, as formerly they had
done of his father and them in those days.&quot; The servant replyed
she hoped for better things, and James Appelby his rejoinder to
that was, &quot;That it was but bare hopes,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for the law hath as good
right to try a King as a subject, as experience the fair tryall of the
last King Charles the First. And the same law hath the same
power over this Charles the Second; which if he see not before he
be a yeare elder, I'll be content to hang for him, therefore never
feed yourselves fatt with vaine hopes of a boasting sound and
ring, a King! a King! No. Let him be sure that his
treacherous wayes and his red letter men's (meaning the King and
Papist's) will not many years after seventy-eight be engraven
upon his neck with letters of blood, as sure as his father's was in
forty-eight; he need expect no other.&quot;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dorothy Stephenson, being servant to Mr. Wm. Orfeur of
Allergarth</font> , about eight years ago, heard him say to Mr. Edmond
Appleby,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Before the Papists be wronged I will goe to the King.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Upon which Mr. Appleby replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;For ought I knowe the King
is but a rogue and beares with Papists;&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and Mr. Orfeur said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;That is more then you can prove.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>She further sayth that
she hath seene Mr. Edmond Appleby both clip and coyne
silver at Asherton, she being then his servant, about twenty yeares
