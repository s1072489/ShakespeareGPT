<comment type="compiler">BETSY AND GAYLAND.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> &quot;What,
my dear,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he, taking her in a free
manner by the hand,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;have you been so
closely watched by your guardian and
guardianesses here, that no kind
moment offered for you to answer the
devoirs of your humble servant?&quot; &quot;The
surest guardians of my fame and peace,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she, snatching her hand away,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;is
the little share of understanding I am
mistress of, which, I hope, will always
be sufficient to defend my honour in
more dangerous attacks, than the rude
impertinencies of an idle coxcomb.&quot;

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>These words, and the air with which
they were spoke, one would think, should
have struck with confusion the person to
whom they were directed; but Gayland
was not so easily put out of countenance,
and looking her full in the face,</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- &quot;Ah,
Child!&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;sure you are not
in your right senses to-day: -- 
understanding, -- impertinencies, -- idle
coxcomb, -- very pleasant i'faith! but upon
<pagebreak id="34" />
my soul, if you think these airs become
you, you are the most mistaken woman
in the world.&quot; &quot;It may be so,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried
she, ready to burst with inward spite at
his insolence,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;but I should be yet more
mistaken, if I were capable of thinking
a wretch, like you, worthy of any thing
but contempt.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>With these words she
flung out of the room, and he pursued
her with a horse-laugh, till she was out of
hearing, and then went into the
dining-room, where he found lady Mellasin, and
several who had come to visit her.</nonSpeech>

<comment type="compiler">MR. GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>After having ended what they had to
say to each other upon business,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Mr.
Goodman,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the alderman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;we
have long been friends, I always thought
you an honest, fair-dealing man, and
am, therefore, very much surprized you
should go about to put upon me in the
manner you have lately done.&quot; &quot;Put
upon you, sir,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried the merchant,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I
know not what you mean, and am very
certain I never did any thing that
might call in question my integrity,
either to you or any one else.&quot; &quot;It
was great integrity indeed,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed
the alderman, with a sneer,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;to
endeavour to draw my only son into a
clandestine marriage, with the girl you
have at your house.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Goodman
was astonished, as well he might, at this
accusation, and perceiving by some other
words that the alderman let fall, that he
was well acquainted with the love young
Saving had professed for miss Betsy, frankly
related to him all that he knew of the
courtship, and the method he had taken
to put a stop to it.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;That was not
<pagebreak id="49" />
enough, sir,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried the alderman hastily,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;you should have told me of it. -- Do
you think young folks, like them,
would have regarded your forbidding?
-- No, no; I'll warrant you they would
have found some way or other to come
together before now, and the boy might
have been ruined, if I had not been
informed by other hands how things were
carried on, and put it out of the power
of any of you to impose upon me.
The girl may spread her nets to catch
some other woodcock, if she can, -- 
thanks to heaven, and my own
prudence, my son is far enough out of her
reach.&quot;
<pagebreak id="50" />
<comment type="compiler">GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN CONTINUE.</comment>
   &quot;You take a great deal of pains to set
her off,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the alderman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;and since
you married a court-lady not worth a
groat, have got all the romantic idle
notions of the other end of town,
as finely as if you had been bred there.
A good family! -- very pleasant i'faith.
Will a good family go to market? -- 
Will it buy a joint of mutton at the
butcher's? -- Or a pretty gown at the
mercer's? Then, a pretty fortune you
say; -- enough it may be to squander
away at cards and masquerades, for a
month or two. She has suitable
accomplishments too; -- yes, indeed, they
are suitable ones, I believe: -- I
suppose she can sing, dance, and jabber a
little French; but I'll be hanged if she
knows how to make a pye, or a
pudding, or to teach her maid to do it.&quot;
<pagebreak id="51" />
<comment type="compiler">GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN CONTINUE.</comment>
<omission type="line" /> I
sent,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;the night before he
was to go, his portmanteau, and what
other luggage I thought he would have
occasion for, to the inn where the
Harwich stage puts up, and making him
be called up very early in the morning,
told him, he must go a little way out
of town with me, upon extraordinary
business: -- he seemed very unwilling,
said he had appointed that morning to
meet a gentleman, and begged I would
delay the journey to the next day, or
<pagebreak id="52" />
even till the afternoon. What caused
this backwardness, I cannot imagine,
for I think it was impossible he could
know my designs on this score; but,
whatever was in his head, I took care
to disappoint it: -- I listened to none of
his excuses, nor trusted him out of my
sight, but forced him to go with me to
the coach, in which I had secured a
couple of places. He was horridly
shocked when he found where he was
going, and would fain have perswaded
me to repeal his banishment, as he
called it: -- I laughed in my sleeve, but
took no notice of the real motive I had
for sending him away, and told him,
there was an absolute necessity for his
departure; -- that I had a business of
the greatest importance at Rotterdam,
in which I could trust nobody but
himself to negotiate, and that he would
find, in his trunk, letters and other
papers, which would instruct him how
to act.

   &quot;In fine,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>continued the alderman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I
went with him aboard, staid with
him till they were ready to weigh
anchor, then returned, and stood on
the beach till the ship sailed quite
out of sight, so that if my gentleman
had a thought of writing to his mistress,
<pagebreak id="53" />
he had not the least opportunity for it.&quot;
<comment type="compiler">GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN AGREE TO STOP COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
BETSY AND SAVING.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> &quot;by which means,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;all
communication between the young
people will soon be put an end to; he
will grow weary of writing when he
receives no answers, and she of thinking
of him as a lover, when she finds he
ceases to tell her he is so.&quot;
<pagebreak id="54" />
<comment type="compiler">GOODMAN AND BETSY.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> &quot;and,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>added he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;the old 
man is so incensed against him, for
having a thought of that kind in your
favour, that he has sent him beyond
sea, -- I know not to what part; --
but it seems he is never to come back,
till he has given full assurances the
liking he has for you is utterly worn off.&quot;

   &quot;He might have spared himself the
pains,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said miss Betsy, blushing with
disdain,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;his son could have informed
him, how little I was inclinable to listen
to any thing he said on the score of
love; and I myself, if he had asked me
the question, would have given him the
strongest assurances that words could
form, that if ever I changed my
condition, which heaven knows I am far
from thinking on as yet, I should
<pagebreak id="55" />
never be prevailed upon to do it, by
any merits his son was possessed of.&quot;

<comment type="compiler">LADY TRUSTY TO MISS BETSY ON THE PLEASURES OF LONDON.</comment> 
<omission type="sentence" />
&quot;but then&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;the too frequent
repetition of them, may so much
engross the mind, as to take it off from
other objects, which ought to have their
share in it: besides,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>continued she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;there are but too frequent proofs, that
<pagebreak id="60" />
an innate principle of virtue is not
always a sufficient guard against the many
snares laid for it, under the shew of
innocent pleasures, by wicked and 
designing persons of both sexes; nor can it
be esteemed prudence to run ones self
into dangers meerly to shew our strength
in overcoming them; nor, perhaps,
would even the victory turn always to
our glory: the world is censorious,
and seldom ready to put the best
construction on things; so that reputation
may suffer, though virtue triumphs.&quot;
<pagebreak id="61" />
<comment type="compiler">LADY TRUSTY TALKS TO MISS BETSY OF MISS FLORA.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> and, therefore, </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
should be glad, methinks, to see you
separated from that young lady, though it were
but for a small time; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and then gave her to
understand, how great a pleasure it would 
be to her, to get her down with her to
L--e, if it could be any way
contrived, that she could go without miss
Flora.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   &quot;As I have been so long from home,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I know I shall have all the
gentry round the country to welcome
me at my return, and if you should find
the company less polite, than those you
leave behind, it will, at least, diversify
the scene, and render the entertainments
of London new to you a second time,
when you come back.&quot;

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Miss Betsy found in herself a strong
inclination to comply with this proposal, and
told lady Trusty, she should think herself
happy in passing the whole summer with
her; and as to miss Flora, the same offer
might be made to her, without any danger
of her accepting it.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I am not of your
opinion,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the other;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;the girl has
no fortune, but what mr. Goodman shall
be pleased to give her; which cannot
be very considerable, as he has a nephew
in the East-Indies, whom he is extremely
<pagebreak id="62" />
fond of, and will make his heir. Lady
Mellasin would, therefore, catch at the
opportunity of sending her daughter to
a place where there are so many
gentlemen of estates, among whom she might
have a better chance for getting a
husband, than she can have in London,
where her character would scarce entitle
her to such a hope. I will however,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;run the risque, and choose
rather to have a guest, whose company
I do not so well approve of, than be
deprived of one I so much value.&quot;
<pagebreak id="64" />
<comment type="compiler">FLORA, BETSY AND LADY MELLASIN HAVE BOUGHT SILKS.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The young ladies fell to reviewing their
silks; but miss Betsy was no way satisfied
with her's: the more she looked upon it,
the worse it appeared to her.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I shall
never wear this with any pleasure,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said she;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I wish the man had it in his
<pagebreak id="65" />
shop again, for I think it quite ugly.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Miss Flora told her, that she wondered at
her, that the thing was perfectly handsome,
and that my lady's judgment was never
before called in question.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;That may be,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied miss Betsy,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;but certainly every
one ought to please their own fancy in
the choice of their cloaths; for my part
I shall never endure to see myself in it.&quot;
&quot;Not when their fancy happens to differ
from that of those who know better than
themselves what is fit for them,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried
miss Flora;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;and, besides, have the power
over them.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>She spoke this with so much
pertness, that miss Betsy, who had a violent
spirit, was highly provoked.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Power over
them!&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I do not know what
you mean, miss Flora; mr. Goodman is
one of my guardians indeed, but I don't
know why that should entitle his lady to
direct me in what I shall wear.&quot;

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Goodman, who happened to be
looking over some papers in a little closet
he had within his parlour, hearing part of
this dispute, and finding it was like to
grow pretty warm, came out, in hopes of
moderating it. On hearing miss Betsy's
complaint, he desired to see the silk; which
being shewn him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I do not pretend,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;to much understanding in these
things; but, methinks, it is very
<pagebreak id="66" />
handsome.&quot; It would do well enough for
winter, sir,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied miss Betsy;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;but
it is too hot and heavy for summer;
besides, it is so thick and clumsy, it
would make me look as big again as I
am: I'll not wear it, I am resolved, in
the country, whatever I do when I come
to town, in the dark weather.

   &quot;Well,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said mr. Goodman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I will
speak to my lady to get it changed
for something else.&quot; &quot;Indeed, sir,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>cried miss Flora,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I am sure my mamma
will do no such thing, and take it very
ill to hear it proposed.&quot; &quot;You need
not put yourself in any heat,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied
miss Betsy,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I don't desire she should be
troubled any farther about it; but, sir,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>continued she, turning to mr. Goodman,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;I think I am now at an age capable of
choosing for myself, in the article of
dress; and as it has been settled between
you and sir Ralph Trusty, that out of
the income of my fortune, thirty pounds
a year should be allowed for my board,
twenty pounds for my pocket expences,
and fifty for my cloaths, I think I ought
to have the two latter entirely at my own
disposal, and to lay it out as I think
fit, and not be obliged, like a
charity-child, to wear whatever livery my
benefactor shall be pleased to order.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>She
<pagebreak id="67" />
spoke this with so much spleen, that mr.
Goodman was a little nettled at it, and
told her, that what his wife had done was
out of kindness and good-will, which since
she did not take as was meant, she should
have her money to do with as she would.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   &quot;That is all I desire,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;therefore be pleased to let me have twenty
guineas now, or, if there does not
remain so much in your hands, I will
ask sir Ralph to advance it, and you
may return it to him when you
settle accounts.&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried
the merchant hastily,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I see no reason to
trouble my good friend, sir Ralph, on
such a frivolous matter. You shall
have the sum you mention, miss Betsy,
whether so much remains out of the
hundred pounds a year set apart for
your subsistance, or not, as I can but
deduct it out of the next payment; but
I would have you manage with
discretion, for you may depend, that the
surplus of what was at first agreed upon,
shall not be broke into, but laid up to
increase your fortune, which, by the
time you come of age, I hope, will be
pretty handsomely improved.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Miss Betsy then assured him, that she
doubted not of his zeal for her interest,
<pagebreak id="68" />
and hoped she had not offended him in
any thing she had said.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;No, no,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I always make allowances for
the little impatiencies of persons of
your sex and age, especially when dress
is concerned.&quot; <omission type="line" />

<comment type="compiler">BETSY HAS DISCOVERED THAT GAYLAND HAS VISITED FLORA.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>She was, however, beginning to
meditate on this point, when she heard miss
Flora come up stairs, calling at every step,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;miss Betsy! -- miss Betsy! -- where are
you?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Gayland was gone, and his
young mistress being told miss Betsy was
come home, guessed it was she who had
given an interruption to their pleasures,
by coming to the door; she, therefore, as
she could not imagine her so perfectly
convinced, contrived to disguise the whole,
and worst of the truth, by revealing a part
of it; and as soon as she had found her,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;Lord, miss Betsy!&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried she, with an
unparalell'd assurance,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;where have you
been? -- how do you think I have been
served by that cursed toad Gayland?
he came up into our chamber, where
the mantua-maker and I were, and as
soon as she was gone, locked the door,
and began to kiss and touze me so, that
I protest I was frighted almost out of
my wits. The devil meant no harm
though, I believe, for I got rid of him
easy enough; but I wish you had rapped
heartily at the door, and obliged him
to open it, that we both might have
rated him for his impudence.&quot; &quot;Some
people have a great deal of impudence,
<pagebreak id="72" />
indeed,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied miss Betsy, astonished
at her manner of bearing it off.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Aye,
so they have, my dear,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>rejoined the
other, with a careless air;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;but, prithee,
where have you been rambling by your
self?&quot; &quot;No farther than
Bedford-street,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered miss Betsy:</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;you may
see on what errand,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>continued she,

thing of his own extempore, on this

What, because I told you he innocently
romped with me one day in the 
chamber, are you so censorious as to infer
any thing criminal passed between us?&quot;
&quot;Whatever I infer,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied miss Betsy,
disdainfully,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I have better vouchers for
the truth of, than your report, and
would advise you, when you go home,
to get the chink in the pannel of the
wainscot of my lady's dressing-room
stopped up, or your next rendezvous
<pagebreak id="94" />
with that gentleman, may possibly have
witnesses of more ill-nature than
myself.&quot; &quot;That can scarcely be,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
miss Flora, ready to burst with vexation;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;but don't think I value your little
malice; you are only angry because he
slighted the advances you made him,
and took all opportunities to shew how
much his heart and judgment gave
the preference to me.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>These words
so piqued the vanity of miss Betsy, that
not able to bear she should continue in the
imagination of being better liked than
herself, though even by the man she hated,
told her the sollicitations he had made to
her, the letter she had received from him,
and the rebuff she had given him upon
it;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;so that,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;it was not
till after he found there was no hopes
of gaining me, that he carried his
devoirs to you.&quot;

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Miss Flora was more nettled at this
eclaircisement, than she was at the
discovery she now perceived the other had
made of her intrigue: she pretended,
however, not to believe a word of what
she had said; but willing to evade all
farther discourse on that head, returned to
the adventure they had just gone through
with the Oxonians.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Never expect,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;to pass it upon any one of
<pagebreak id="95" />
common sense, that if you had not a
mind to have been alone with that
terrible man, as you now describe him,
you would have staid in the room after
I was gone, and called to you to
follow.&quot;

WHEN FLORA ENTERS.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Miss Flora had not been present when
the maid delivered the letter to miss Betsy;
but coming into the chamber just as she
had finished, and was sealing up the 
answer to it:</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;So,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;have I
catched you? Pray what new lover

she thought worthy of a letter from her,

part of the letter she had received from
miss Forward.

   It being near breakfast-time they went
down together into the parlour, and as
they were drinking their Coffee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Well,
pretty lady,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said mr. Goodman to miss
Betsy, with a smile,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;how did you like
the gentleman that dined here

her, that she could not help blushing.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;Like him, Sir,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I did
not take any notice of him. -- I
remember a stranger was here, and staid
a good while, and that is all; for I
neither observed any thing he said, or
did, or thought on him since.&quot; &quot;The
agreeable confusion,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried mr.

Goodman, gaily,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;you are in at my

him more than you are willing to

You do him but justice I assure you,
for he is very much in love with you.

   &quot;Lord, sir,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>said miss Betsy, blushing
still more,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I cannot imagine what makes
you talk so; I don't suppose the man
thinks of me any more than I do of him.&quot;

let mr. Staple know it would be to no

&quot;have you forgiven my ill humour last

my friend Staple had so poor a chance

because Frank Thoughtless will take it ill

please; for my part I shall not meddle

behaviour, both of mr. Trueworth and
mr. Staple, appear to me to be
unexceptionable; but sure one may allow a
man to have merit, and be pleased with
his conversation, without desiring to be
tacked to him for ever. I verily
believe I shall never be in love; but if I
am, it must be a long length of time,

must make me so.&quot;

captain Hysom is a match that many
a fine lady in this town would jump at;
he has been twenty-five years in the
service of the East-India company, has
made very successful voyages, and is
immensely rich; he has lived at sea,
indeed, the greatest part of his life, and
much politeness cannot be expected from
him; but he is a very honest

good-natured man, and I believe means well.
I wish he had offered himself to Flora.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps, sir, I should not have refused
him,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she, briskly;</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I should
like a husband prodigiously that would

mrs. Prinks had orders to pay him off

that is missing. John would not allow
it, and being in a passion, told mrs.
Prinks, that he would not leave the
house without his full wages; that for
any thing he knew the strainer might
be gone after the diamond necklace.
This I suppose she repeated to my lady,
and that put her in so ill a humour
this morning, that if my master had
not come down as he did, we should
all have had something at our heads.
However,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>continued the wench,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;she
ordered mrs. Prinks to give him his
whole money; but, would you believe
it, miss? My master was no sooner

still, (the poor fellow, God knows, only
stayed to take his leave of us,) she tore

that keeps a pawn-broker's shop in
Thieving-lane, and as he was sitting in
a little room behind the counter, that
it seems shuts in with glass doors, who
should he see through the window, but
mrs. Prinks come in; she brought my
lady's diamond necklace, and pledged
it for a hundred and twenty, or a
hundred and thirty guineas, I am not sure
which he told me, for I have the
saddest memory; but it is no matter for
that. John was strangely confounded,
as you may think, but resolved to see
into the bottom, and when mrs. Prinks
was got into the coach, popped up
behind it, and got down when it stopped,
which was at the sign of the hand and
tipstaff in Knaves-acre; so that this
money was raised to get somebody that
was arrested out of the bailiff's hands,
for John said, it was what they call a
spunging-house that mrs. Prinks went
into. Lord! how deceitful some people
are, my poor master little thinks how
his money goes; but I'll warrant our
house-keeping must suffer for this.&quot;
