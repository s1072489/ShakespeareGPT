<pagebreak id="A2R" />
<comment type="compiler">PAPIRIUS PRAETEXTATUS, A BOY OF GREAT UNDERSTANDING, WAS 
PERMITTED TO JOIN THE DEBATES OF THE SENATE.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>his mother at his comming home,
asked the boy what was the cause of their so
often meeting, &amp; what was concluded in the Senate 
that day? which he apprehending, that he was
not to reveale, remained silent, but his mother
further importuning him, and threatning him
with the rod, that unlesse he would acquaint her
with all their proceedings, she would whip him
soundly both to avoid the prejudice that might
happen, if he should have revealed the secrets of
the Senate, and to satisfie his Mother for the
present, he told her, that they had made a Decree,
and establisht it, that it should be lawfull for
every man to have two wives. Upon which, she
presently, without any more adoe, sent to the chief
Matrons in <font>Rome</font> , that it would please them to
vouchsafe to come to her house, and she would
acquaint them with such a project that her 
husband &amp; theirs had done in the Senate house that
<pagebreak id="A2V" />
day and to their prejudice, as wanted president
or example.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At which summons, many or the most of them,
gave her a visit, where she revealed unto them the
whole businesse, as it was repeated by her young
Son <font>Papirius</font> , and desired their assistance how to
prevent it, &amp; for that to enter into present
consultation how they might abrogate that Law,
and in stead therof, that every woman might
have two husbands: This was no sooner noysed
in the City, but it was presently bruted in the
Suburbs, &amp; before they could propose any thing
to be concluded, there was a great noyse of
rapping at the door; they se~ding to know the cause
thereof, answer was returned them, that there
were a great many of Tradesme~s wives, who
understanding the cause of that meeting, desired to
have their voyces in the Counsell, alleadging
withal, that though the Matrons were noble, and
they but Mechanicks, &amp; poor Tradesmens wives,
yet no Parliament could be held, but there must
be a lower House as well as a higher, &amp; Speakers
for both; and further, that nothing cold be
concluded in the higher, but it must first be
debated in the lower: upon which reasons, they
were admitted, and a great <font>Parlour</font> serving for
a <font>Parliament House</font> , every one took their places
acording to their degrees, &amp; which was a
wonder amongst women, they suffered one to speak 
at once, which was the mother of <font>Papirius</font> , who
said as followeth,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<pagebreak id="A3R" />
   To you, as well of the Manufacture, as the
Matronship, I speake to all in generall, I haue knowe
a Lord contented with one Lackey, a Master with
one man, a Tenant with one Land-lord, a Bird
with one mate, a Cow with one Milk-mad, and
shall a man desire to have two wives, that (alas)
with al he can do, can hardly please one? nay, grant
them two, in time they will grow to ten, from ten
to twentie, and then what a racket there would be
who should rule the roast? Nay, I have heard of 
one that had at once a 1000. wives &amp; concubines:
Now out upon him for a <font>Jew</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said a second) and
taking the tale out of her mouth, thus proceeded:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Methinks they should rather have consulted, that
woe~n might have had 2 strings to their Bow, that
if one slipt the other might hold, one for weeke
dayes to drudge within doors, another for
Holy-dayes to walke abroad with her, and usher her in
his best cloaths; keeping one for delight, the other
for her drudgery; </dialogue><nonSpeech>to which motion, they with an
unanimous voyce consented: then up starts a third
and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> our sexe is now of late grown Cowards,
carpet and curtaine hearted: Where be those 
magnanimous and Masculine spirited Matrons? Those
valiant Viragoes? those lusty Ladies? those
daring <font>Amazonian</font> Damsels, <font>Orithena, Penthisilaea,
Thalestres</font> and the rest? who made Coxecombes of
<font>Keysars</font> , Puppets of Princes, Captives of Captains,
Fooles of Philosophers, and Hench men of their
husbands? but though we want weapons, and are
abridged of their armes, yet they shall know, that
<pagebreak id="A3V" />
we have the Law in our owne hands, and in our
own cases we will be our owne Lawyers, and plead
our own rights. For wee have tongues to tell our
own Tales, and our Tales shall be heard and
handled, when some of theirs shall not: What, give
these Cocks leave to crow, and we shall have the
Ravens follow after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>These words were spoke with such an Emphasis,
that there was a generall hum throughout all the
Parliame~t-parlour: then there was a motion made,
that every one for the present should put in a
particular of their own grievances: First, up starts one
Mistris <font>Rattle</font> , a Taylors wife, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke
the Proverb may be very well verified in my
husband; which is, that many Taylors goe to the
making up of one man; for he hath no more
mettle in him then a Mouse; he works altogether with
hot needle, and burnt thread: for nothing he doth
prospers with me. I thinke the reason is, because
he uses an unlawful Yard, and wants that handfull
which belongs to the Citie measure, or else because
he sits crosse leg'd on his shop-board, like a dead
Hare on a Poulterers stall, and no good work can
be done that way. If at any time he make me a new
peticoate, he will threaten to sit upon my skirts,
and that's all: He will sow and sow, and yet when
he hath done all hee can, it proves but so and so,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and with that she put finger in the eye and wept.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Nay, another Gossip, seeing and pittying the
poor puling creature, rose up, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I take it,
your best course Mistris <font>Rattle</font> , is to acquaint your
<pagebreak id="A4R" />
selfe with some Courtier his Customer, and when
any Masque or show is to be presented at Court, he
may helpe you to a good standing. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then another
starts up and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my name is <font>Franke Fall-downe</font> , a
Felt-makers wife, and know no more from my
husband of the three parts that belong to a Noune
Substantive but the first, and that is felt, and
nothing else worthy to be heard or understood. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sisly</font>
the Sadlers wife sate next.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, you may take me
too in your number, for my case is as much to be
condoled as any's, who have a very pea-goose and
patch-pannell to my good man: well, his girthes
or Latchets may passe for currant, but I could never
see a good stirre-up from him since he was my 
husband: I confesse he is saddle-nos'd and saddlebackt
too, but never could set the saddle on the right
horse since I knew him: </dialogue><nonSpeech>to whom the 
Horse-coursers wife, called <font>Harebrain</font> , replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my good man
is his customer, who keepes the saddle to himselfe,
but gives me the bit and the bridle: he can teach
his horses to pace as he list; but for himself he hath
neither good amble, trot, nor gallop.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>After them <font>Grace</font> the Gold-smiths wife, <font>Sarah</font>
the Silke-mans, <font>Kate</font> the Comfit-makers, <font>Beatrice</font>
the Brasiers, <font>Parnell</font> the Apothecaries, <font>Maudlin</font> the
Masons, <font>Winifred</font> the Wyre-drawers, <font>Dorothy</font> the
Drapers, &amp;c. every one laid downe their severall
grievances, which as they were attentively heard,
so they were much to be commiserated (I am loath
to insist on too many, therefore for breuities sake
let these suffice for the rest) then consulation was
<pagebreak id="A4V" />
had how to rectifie what was amisse, for the
generall good of their Sexe, how to rest the power in
men from wronging their wives, that
thenceforward they might live in the more ease, pride,
pompe, and liberty: for which they thought fit 
that good and wholsome Lawes should bee
enacted.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The first was Mistris <font>Tattle-well</font> that speak, who
said, that it was not onely fitting but necessary,
that every woman should have two husbands:</nonSpeech><dialogue> for
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> was not every woman born with two
legges, two hands, two eyes, two eares: and every
deepe Well ought to have two Buckets, while one
is comming up, the other going down? have not
most great houses two doores? likewise have not
most Tavernes a fore-door &amp; a backe-door, with
two signes and two bushes, every ship a fore-Mast
and a maine-Mast: most Cities two or three gates,
and every gate three or foure Watch-men; and
every Beadle three or foure men every night in his
Lanthorne, or else their money? hath not every
stoole or chaire three or foure legges, and every
bed-stead two posts, (and three or four Curtains)
the better to support the other parts of them, and
therefore in conscience every Woman may have
two husbands: for have not we women six
Sences, and men but five? the major part wee know
includes the minor: therefore the case is cleare on
our sides, for wee have nothing to offend and
defend our selves but our tongues, which wee bring
in for another sence; for the tongue tells what
<pagebreak id="A5R" />
the eare heares, what the eye sees, what the hand
handles, what the palat tasteth, what the nose
smelleth, therfore the tongue ought to be the sixth
Sence, which we must maintain for our own 
safety: though woman was taken out of the side of
man, yet let men know, that they cannot, nor shall
not alwayes keepe us under.
   I put the case to you, suppose a handsome Lasse
marries a Sea-faring man, perchance his
occasions call him to goe a long voyage to SEA, as to
the East or West Indies, or to the straights of
<font>Magellan</font> , the Reed or Red SEA, or to the
<font>Persian</font> Gulfe: he is bound to stay a yeare, two or three,
before he can returne: doe you (nay prethee good
sister, let mee not bee interrupted in my speech:
pray silence, or I will say no more; for I now
speak to the purpose) as I have said, doe you think
it convenient such a prettie soule should lye alone,
having been wedded so short a time <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: atime</comment> , and only
tasted of you know what, and having been a
fellow feeler, and helper in most cases, for the 
Common-wealths good, that she can be content to lye alone
tumbling and tossing in a good featherbed, 
sometimes to the Wall, sometimes to the doore, 
sometimes of one side, and somtimes of the other:
sighing and groaning, as if her very twatling
strings would breake; making her moane to the
Curtaines, fumbling and biting, or tearing the
sheets, and by that meanes ease her oppressed body
and minde: nay, I should not say oppressed bodie
for there I was mistaken, there my tongue went
<pagebreak id="A5V" />
too fast, I should have said her troubled and
perplexed spirit, heart, or what you terme it, Ought
not, I say, such women to have two or three
husbands? yes, yes, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> being alwayes provided,
and for the good of the Common-wealth: So
likewise the Souldier and Captain when they are gone
to the Wars, the Merchant, the Factor, &amp; the
Mariner when they are gone to Sea, a foolish Plaintiffe
and his Defendant, that will come up post two or 
three hundred miles to spend his money, and stay
a whole Terme before he return to his beloved:
ought not these (and many more which I could
name, which for brevites sake I omit) to leave one
husband at home, while the other being at Sea,
lookes to the maine boling, and that the
fore-Mast and maine-yard, and all other tackling be fit
and compleat for his occations: The Facter while
he looks to cast up his accompts abroad, shee may
looke and cast up hers at whome: the Plaintiffe and
Defendant while they be spending mony at Law
shee may get some at home by love. All these cases
are to be considered; for every musket must have --
scouring sticke, and every Gun must have a
rammer, and every pen must be dipped in inke before it
will write: Has not every Constable his Beadle, 
every Serjeant his Yeaman? hath not every Officer
in a ship his mate: as the Surgeon he hath his mate,
the Master his mate; and the Gunner his mate: It is
good to have two strings to ones Bow, if one break
the other may hold: that if one be dogged and 
surly, the other may be pleasant and joviall; that while
<pagebreak id="A6R" />
one be off the hooks, the other may be on the
hinges; Upon which motion it is fully agreed
upon by us women, who are here present, which find
it better for us woman to have two husbands                          
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: hnsbands</comment> , that
if one be sick, the other may be well, one abroad
and another at home: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and this was likewise the
motion of one Mistris <font>Tabitha Tireman</font> , and all
giving out it may be a great <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: agreat</comment> meanes to       
abolish the old
custome of making Cuckolds: ere shee could
proceed, they all cryed it up for currant:</nonSpeech><dialogue> but let mee
tell you one thing, which might put a rub in our 
way: What if our husbands object and say, that
we promised to love &amp; obey them at the day of our
marriage, &amp; that we must be tyed to that promise?
By our Lady that is true </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what must be
our plea for that? Ile tell you </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Mistris <font>Tatle-well</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Let us answer thus much in that behalfe; that we
had a mentall <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: amentall</comment> reservation, when the wisest 
of us
said so; for though our husbands expect it at our
hands all our life time, we must say that we ment
it only for that day, and the first night, and no
longer; and therefore by this meanes we may wave
the businesse, and repeale that Law: </dialogue><nonSpeech>whereupon
they all agreed unto it by a generall <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: agenerall</comment>     
consent, and a <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: a-</comment>
great commendation bestowed on mistris <font>Tatle-wel</font> ,
for finding out this misterie and evasion, which
was set downe at first by these men by way of error
and mistake. Then Mistris <font>Prudence Prate-all</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
let it be likewise enacted, that since maids for the
most part mary in hast, and repent at leisure, that
we may be hasty also in our own houses, that if our
<pagebreak id="A6V" />
husbands be peevish, we may pout; when they are
harsh, we may be humorous: they curst we
crabbed; and when they think to make us melancholy,
we in requitall strive to make them horne mad, by
making our Petticoates our Purlewes: at which
if they grudge or grumble, wee may finde answers,
by looking upon our apron-strings; knowing by
experience, that most men are of a strange kidney,
and will never bee at quiet full nor fasting; </dialogue><nonSpeech>this
also past amongst the rest. The next that spake in
Court, was a madde wench, called <font>Besse Blue</font> , or
<font>Blot-booke</font> a Scriveners wife, who also desired,
that one thing might bee rectified concerning her
husbands trade, that in all contracts, 
Covenants, and Joyntures made betwixt Batchelours
and maides, Widowes and Widowers, the often
word, Notwithstanding, may be quite razed out,
and in the stead thereof, <font>Alwayes provided</font> as
often put in:</nonSpeech><dialogue> the want of which reformation, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have endured to my great prejudice: </dialogue><nonSpeech>To
this they generally assented, and desired that it
might be prickt downe with an <font> <foreign>Imprimis</foreign> </font> : In then
co~es Mistris <font>Eleanor Ever-crosse</font> with her five eggs
and said, that shee desired to have another added,
which should not be addl'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my husband </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
in anger said, he would thump me, to whom I
answered; thump me? where wilt thou thump mee?
thump me but where thou shouldst thu~p me, or Ile
make it the dearest thumping that ever thou didst
thumpe in thy life: and I thinke I hit him home,
which was more than ever he did to me, and then
<pagebreak id="A7R" />
I had him on the hip: and you should have kept
him so when you had him there </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reployed 
<font>Mary Malepart</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if you had been wise: But concerning
your great thumpers, concerning him who said
that a Law might be made, that no woman should
suffer her self to be thumpt but as she ought to be;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>to who~ the whole Court willingly condiscended.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Thus </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Mistris <font>Dorothy Doe-little</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I hold it
requisite also, that every woman of sence, should
take delight to please her eye with the most
curious objects, either of such pictures as wee like, or
such men as wee love: Her eare rather with 
curious and choyse Musicke, or have some Courtship
that may content her, or somewhat publisht in
her praise: Her smell rather with sweet and
redolent flowers at home, or precious odours and
perfumes fetcht from abroad: her touch either
with the Pluch and Taffates of her owne gay 
garments, or by the griping of his smooth &amp; soft
hand whom she most dearly affected: Her taste
with all dainty and deare fare, with either fowle
or Fish, with sweete Wines and sweete meats, 
banqueting and junkets, and every variety that can
taste the appetite, or please the palate. And for our
more ease let us lie a bed till ten of the clocke, and
the~ have a Candle <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Caudle</comment> brought to our bed side   
for our
break-fast; and be ready by dinnertime, and then
walke abroad to take the ayre till supper-time;
and so spend the weeke about; and if they aske the
reason thereof, tell them it must bee so, because
it must be so; and let them understand, that Mo~day
<pagebreak id="A7V" />
is Sundayes brother, and that Tuesday is such
another, Wednesday they must goe to Church &amp; pray,
and Thursday is halfe holy day, Friday it is too
late to begin to spin, and Saturday all the world
knows is half holy-day agen.
   You speak wel in that </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Mrs. <font>Bridget Bold-face</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
for why should we toyl and turmoyl for our 
horn-headed and hard-headed husbands, and not taste of
the sweet as well as of the sowre, of the gaine as
the paine, the pleasure as the puzzle. If the 
husbands be ours, then be their goods ours, their lands
ours, their Cash and Coine ours, and all their
moveables, (howsoever seldome in motion ours too)
and at our command; then why should we be
niggards, and not spend freely of our owne? or why,
when they be prodicall abroad, should we be
penurious at home? nay, let us eate good fare, keepe
good fires, want nothing that Women should have,
good cates after good company: we can then bid
any God-speed without good gossips. It is fit wee
should bee merie so it fall within compasse of
meanes: and for my owne part, I make use of the
old proverb.

<font>Every good huswife, as soone as she's up,
Hath her hand in the Gup-board, her nose in the cup.</font>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which also was agreed upon with such an
vnanimous consent, that this law above the rest should
be writ in great Letters, to distinguish them from
the rest, as best corresponding with most of their
<pagebreak id="A8R" />
conditions,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Further let it be enacted, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Anne
Ever-crosse</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that whosoever shall hereafter take a
Wife, shall doe it with the intent to please her,
serve her, and obey her, and the first day of
their Bridals, as a signe and token of duty to her,
and all the rest, place here at the upper end of the 
Table; or if she like not that place, put her in the
middle, and with his hat in his hand wait on her
till she hath halfe, or at the most three quarters
dined; and then (if he have leave) to sit down, which
must be done by her licence, that he place himself
at the lower end of the Table, and make a short
meale tell they be ready to take away, and that at
supper he doe the like, and after that she goe to bed
first, and rise last, and not attempt any thing but
that stands with her good liberty and liking, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and
this past amongst the rest for currant.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then roase up one Mrs. <font>Rachel Rattlebooby</font> , &amp; said</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I intreat that I may have a finger in the pye too as
well as the rest: a fooles bolt (like my hasbads) is
soon shot, and so is mine: when I was as well in
health as any here, I complained to my good man
of my heart and head, my Liver and my Lungs, &amp;
(indeed) I know not of what: who comming home
said, wife how doe you doe? I answered sick, good
man, very sicke: then the fond Coxcomb bid me
speake for any thing I had a minde unto; for saith 
he, no question but thou dost breed; I, I, said I, I
do breed, but you never get me any thing: no, saith
he, who gets it then? I told him againe that it was
no matter to him who gets it; for sure said I, I may
<pagebreak id="A8V" />
long and long, but shall be sure to come short of
what I long for; why what dost thou long for, said
my husband? For that (quoth I) which is beyond
your reach, I wisse: Silke Gowne, and Sattin
Petticoate of the fashion, an Italian cut-worke
Handkercheif, and a black bag, with al the 
appurtenances thereto belonging. I but said he, sweete Wife,
these are above my calling: why then said I, mine
own calling shall serve; for the next gallant
Player I will call in, who, what he cannot adde to the
happinesse of your memory, shall strive to augme~t
in your honourable state of Matrimony: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and this
she desired to be registred amongst the rest: at which
some were unwilling that it should passe, yet the
major part were so fully be~t, that it was set down
by the she-Scrivener in paper, and after in
parchment to be endorsed. Mistris <font>Tabitha Teare-sheete</font>
then stood up and began to puffe &amp; snuffe, &amp; said,
she wondred why men should take so much upon
them, when one Woman is able upon her owne
knowledg to bring ten of them, &amp; take them one
after another, upon their knees;</nonSpeech><dialogue> therfore </dialogue><nonSpeech>said shee</nonSpeech><dialogue>
adde this to the other, let women from hence 
forward, if they be shreerish or shie, try it out with
them at sharp, or if beetle-head and blockish, with
blunter weapons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>But Mistris <font>Dorcas Doe-little</font> , was out at that
saying she loved her ease and quiet, and said, that the
safest way (as he thought) was to sleep in a whole
skin:</nonSpeech><dialogue> yet </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my husband is a Gamester, and
as he games abroad, so I play at home: if hee bee at 
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
bowles and kisse the Mistris, I can for recreation
play at rubbers with his man: when he hath beene
all the day at passage, &amp; hazard, at night he comes
home, and playes with me at Doublets, 
Barramesace, and Back-gammon, but I am sometimes even
with him, for when he with his sweet-hearts 
ventures his state at the hole, I with his servant can
passe away the time at In and In: </dialogue><nonSpeech>after spake Mistris
<font>Rachel Rattle-a-pace</font> , and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as I hold Mistris
<font>Dorcas</font> , that lawfull which you doe, so I hope, that
I bringing my sack to the mill, it may be ground
among the rest: that is, when our hausbands trouble
us, we may likewise torment them: if they fret, wee
frowne: they grudge, we grumble, they prate, we
glout, they crosse, wee curst; if they bend their
browes, we may bend our fists; and be they never
so outragious, we to carry no coals in any case.
   But let it then be added </dialogue><nonSpeech> (saith shee that sate
next) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that no reconcilement without some
reward, and no pardon may be granted without
a new gowne and Peticoate; which if demurr'd
upon, at the first or second demand, it shall bee in
her choyce to aske him the third: and if he cog and
offer to kisse you, and tell you that he will kisse
you, bid him take you about the middle and kisse
the heaviest end: or if he faile, she may reade him a 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: a-</comment> 
<font>Juniper Lecture</font> , as far as the scope of her invention,
<font>or the scarcitie of breath will give her leave</font> . Or if hee
notwithstanding all this, be pevish and perverse,
she may also continue proud and peremptory, till
she raile him into reconcilement, and make him
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
provide a feast to entertaine her Gossips, and make
his peace that way. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And then said another taking
the tale out of her mouth,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if she have a mind to take
the aire, or walke to Green-goose Fair, or to any
merrie meeting, or Market: if she desire his
company, that hee new blacke his shooes, and put on his
best hat and cloake to wait on her thither, ushering
her before, or take her gently by the arme, and
lovingly to leade her: or if (for some reasos best
known to her selfe) she would have his abscence,
that he patiently put money in her purse, and stay
at home without grumbling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>All this while good orders and decrees, with a
generall silence was observed, which after grew to
a meere confusion: for the rest having much
matter to utter, some got up to the tongues end, and
had not the patience to stay the time, &amp; take their
turnes: but all of these who had not yet spoke, 
tumultuously breaking out into clamour, every one
desiring to be heard first, and the morre they were
heard, the lesse they were understood: one cryed
out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let not maides stay from marriage till they are
troubled with the greene-sicknesse: </dialogue><nonSpeech>another said,
that if their husbands revelled in the Hall, they
might rule in the Kitchin: &amp; if they offered to
domineer, they might spoyle their meate in dressing:
a third, that if their husbands came home drunke, 
they might lock them ought of doors, &amp; whilst she
tooke her rest in her Cabbin, leave him to take up
his lodging in the kennell: a fourth, that if they
prated to be heard, they might poure a pisse pot on
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
their heads: and if after complaint were made, they
might answer, they meant neither murthur nor
manslaughter, but what they did, was <font> <foreign>se defendendo</foreign> </font> :
with many others, to as little or no purpose: by
reason of which acclamation and noyse, the Session
was for that time to be dissolved: but after an O
yes silence being made, it was concluded amongst
them, that with those Articles agreed upon, they
should preasently passe from thence to the 
Statehouse, and deliver up their grievances to them:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   But one thing we have forgot, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> which
is a main matter, that is, to seeke out cure for any
old or young <font>Cuckolds</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>then spake Mistris <font>Dorothy
Do-little</font> , and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> my good man came home drunk
the other day, and because I should not see him in
that manner, he hid himselfe in the house of
speciall Office, and their he began to ease his stomacke,
and lay about him like a Hog, when he hath eaten
so much that he is ready to burst: &amp; because I should
not heare him: hee thrusts his head into the hole;
and whether it was his large Asses eares, or his Bul
necke, I cannot tell, but he could not get his necke
out again, but needs must pull up the seate about
his necke, so that he looked as if he had been on
the Pillorie. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Upon which relation they all fell
into a great laughter, and withall concluded that it
was his Hornes.</nonSpeech><dialogue> For <font>Actaeon</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> put his head
out of the window well enough, but could not get
it back again, which was long of his Hornes: this
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is your husbands case. I pray you
Mistris <font>Tattlewell</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> tell me, and the rest of our
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
sisters the cure and remedie for it <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: ti</comment> . Thus you   
must
doe </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> my deare and loving sisters, because
the effect lyes at the heart, &amp; the cause in the head,
you must first remove the cause, and the effect will
follow. <font>First, you must carry down the griefe by his
Posteriors, which must be done by a medicine that will both
purge and camfort him at one and the same time; for
desperate diseases must have desperate cures: get I say, (I
speake to you all, as well as to you</font> Mistris Doe-litle) <font>a
gallon of the best</font> Pump-water, <font>such as will bear the
Patentees Crowne-soape, for that will scour well, then set it
on the fire in a brasse Skellet, and put therein a good
large Bed-post, and let it boyle till it be dissolved to a
jelly, then take it off the fire, and put three or foure sorts of
spices in, as</font> Cloves, Mace, Nut-megs: <font>then take two
or three ounces of</font> Suger-candy, <font>two ounces of the Sirrup
or</font> Hearts-ease <font>and</font> dainty Content, <font>with an ounce of</font>
Candid Forgetfulnesse, <font>and</font> Beter Conceit, <font>all this
is cordiall: then when it is coole, put in a little</font> Rubarb,
<font>a litle</font> Colaquintida, <font>a litle</font> Stibium, <font>and some grosse
and</font> Long white Pepper, <font>then let it boyle softly, and
when so done, the next morning let the patient man drink
it next his heart, and keep him warm: but you must bee
carefull that it be given him when the Moon is neare the
full; not when she is forked or horned, lest you lose your
labour and cost: for the Moon loves horned people, which
are sometimes like her selfe: but when she is near the full,
she is then indifferent, whether horned or not horned,
all is one to her, and therefore may then best bee
performed</font> .
   Now the inward remedie being applyed, he must
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
then observe the outward meanes: he must conceit
himselfe a Batchelour or widower againe, as he
was at the first state when he came a wooing to her:
the~ must he make himself a mourning suit &amp; cloak,
&amp; walk as demurely and as sad, as if his Wife were
dead indeed: he must likewise be so well conceited
of himselfe, as if no such thing had ever beene or
thought of: then he must refraine her company: &amp;
the house where she is, eight or ten dayes together,
then begin to enquire of her, as if she were a
stranger to him, afterwards visit her, and then send her
presents, and make much of her, then make good
cheere, and when you are in a merry veine, aske
her if she can love you? then will she say presently,
yes, if you can affect her: then get a licence, and
forthwith marry her: that beeing done, see then if
any dear so much as point at you with their 
fingers, or call you Cuckold as formerly they did, if
they doe, then have you the Civill Law on your
side to punish them there, &amp; an action at the
Common Law for defamation, and their punish their
purses and bodie too; and this is the only cure for
old and new Cuckolds: and withall take notice,
that this must bee done when the Moone is
encreasing, and in the second quarter, for it will help
their businesse forward, and cause them better to
conclude their intended purposes: <omission type="line" />
