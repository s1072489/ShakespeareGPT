   <nonSpeech>Master Serjeant <font>Heale</font> opened the matter, and delivered
the effect of the inditement; In whose speech this was
observed, that he charged Sir <font>Walter</font> to have intended the
Intitling of the Lady <font>Arabella Steward</font> to the Crowne, who
he said had no more title thereunto than he had himselfe,
and further said after a little pause, that hee for his owne
part did disclaime and renounce all title thereunto.
whereat Sir <font>Walter Rawleigh</font> smiled. The Serjeant concluding
Mr. Atturney <font>Cooke</font> began, and with a long discourse              
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: disource</comment>
amplified (with vehement words and actions) the severall
treasons whereof Sir <font>Walter</font> stood indited, wherein hee
so farre moved Sir <font>Walter</font> that hee many times offered to
make answer for himselfe before the Court would give 
him leave; protesting Mr Atturney told him newes hee
never heard of before, and that his memory (by reason of
his sicknesse) was so feeble that he could not remember so
many circumstances as Mr. Atturney tired him withall;
But Mr. Atturney pressed the Lords that the Kings
evidence ought not to be broken, or dismembred, whereby
it might loose much of its grace and vigor:
notwithstanding it was yeelded, when M. Atturney came to his proofe,
Sir <font>Walter Rawleigh</font> should have leave to answer his
severall points as they were objected: In Mr. Atturney divers
things were observed which were said and used in his
narration and evidence. Some captiously noted that hee said
this treason did tend not onely to the overthrow of true
religion and destruction of all our soules, but even to the
losse of our goods, lands, and lives: But it seemeth hee
<pagebreak id="5" />
meant reciprocally: others thought him full of
impertinent phrases and complements, and specially when hee
spake of the Kings issue or of the Lords, after hee said hee
would say nothing of them, then hee would presently fall
into a grosse and palpable adulation of them to their faces:
but in their commendations he spake nothing but truth:
some noted his care and diligence in delivering to the
people that the King said he would loose lands, crowne, &amp; life
before he would suffer a tolleration or alterration in
Religion; and that to these Traytors (for <font>Cobham</font> and <font>Gray</font>
were upon the bye) he had done nothing rigorously,
nothing unnaturally: nothing precipitatly, not rigorously,
because no torture used: not unnaturally, because the
brother was not pressed (further then he would) to accuse his
brother: not precipitatly because of the long time his
gracious Majesty had promised before hee would bring them
to their Arraignment: this was much to the satisfaction
of the people, but this he was commanded to deliver: All
the assembly could have wished that hee had not behaved
himselfe so violently and bitterly, nor used so great
provocation to the prisoner: which the better sort imputed
to his zeale in the Kings service, and to the passion which
overwhelmed him in the cause of his Countrey: as when
he brake forth into these and the like speeches:</nonSpeech><dialogue> This
horrible and detestible Traytor, this maine Traytor </dialogue><nonSpeech> (for the
rest were upon the bye) </nonSpeech><dialogue> this instigator and seducer to
treasons, he that hath a spanish heart, you are an odious man,
see with what a whorish forehead he defends his faults:
this is he that would take away the King and his Cubbs, O
abominable Traytor: <comment type="compiler">NARRATOR'S COMMENT OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="6" />
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>But when it was 
insinuated that it was said that it would never bee well till the
King and his cubbs were taken away, hee <comment type="compiler">RALEIGH</comment> said that Mr.
Atturney used him basely, barbarously, and rigorously,
and that hee was abase slave and a wretch that spake the
words, but hee received comfort in these base words of
Mr. Atturney for he hoped that it should be the worst he
should be able to doe against him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The accusation may be said to be of two parts, <font> <foreign>viz.</foreign> </font>
Personall against the King, and publikely against the State
and quiet of the Realme. Both high Treason, the
personall Treason was of two sorts. The first a conspiracy
against the Kings life: the second a practise to disable the
Kings title to the Crowne of <font>England</font> . To prove that
<font>Rawleigh</font> intended the Kings death, the confession of 
<font>George Brooke</font> was enforced, who said that his brother my
Lord <font>Cobham</font> told him that he and my Lord <font>Gray</font> were but
<pagebreak id="7" />
upon the Bye, but the said <font>Cobham</font> and Sir <font>VValter
Rawleigh</font> were upon the maine for it, and should never be well
till the King and his Cubbs were taken away. And further
said that he thought in his conscience that the said speech
of the Kings Cubbs proceeded from <font>Rawleigh</font> . And it was
further declared, that the confession of <font>George Brooke</font> was
enforced, and not voluntarily made, untill Sir <font>Griffin
Markham</font> , and <font>Watson</font> the Priest had vouched him for the
knowledge of some farther purpose, than the surprizing of
the King. To this Sir <font>Walter</font> answered that <font>George
Brook</font> would say anything of him, but he thanked God
he never spake with him; for if he had spoken but five
words he perceived that it had been enough. Then my
Lord <font>Cecil</font> said that indeed he thought that <font>George Brook</font>
had a spleen to Sir <font>Walter</font> , but his brother my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> and he were good friends, and therefore he could not
tell whither he hated <font>Rawleigh</font> so much as to do his
brother so great a displeasure, and said, that my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> might if he did practice (as himselfe confessed) with
<font>Spaine</font> , give Sir <font>Walters</font> name in to credit him withall, as
a man that favoured him, and on whom he did presume
more than he had reason. To prove that <font>Rawleigh</font>
practised to scandalize his Majesties Title to the Crowne.
My Lord <font>Cobhams</font> confession was produced, That Sir
<font>Walter</font> delivered him a Booke concerning the Kings Title,
but told him withall, that it was a very foolish book which
he delivered to his brother <font>George</font> to consider of, and
<font>George Brook</font> confessed that his brother gave him such a
Book, whereof he read onely the Titles of the Chapters,
containing matter against the Kings Title and Line. And
it was not omitted by the Attourney, that this Booke was
delivered upon occasion of my Lord <font>Cobhams</font>
discontentment. <font>Rawleigh</font> confessed that he had such a booke which
he never read, but it was intitled, <font>A Defence of the Queenes
<pagebreak id="8" />
proceedings against</font> Mary <font>Queene of</font> Scotland, And
constantly denyed that he delivered it to my Lord <font>Cobham</font> , 
but that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> tooke it out of his Study (if he
had any such of his) without his knowledge, he protested:
Here my Lord <font>Henry Howard</font> signified that my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> was asked in his examination whither Sir <font>VValter</font> gave
him the booke, or that he took the same? and he said that
<font>Sir Walter</font> gave it him: But that since he had told some
(who were againe with him) that whereas he had said that
Sir <font>Walter</font> gave him the booke, the truth was he took
the same of himselfe out of his study when he was asleepe.
Then my Lord <font>Cecil</font> asked Sir <font>Walter</font> , where he had the
book; and he said he tooke it out of my late Lord
Treasurer <font>Burleighs</font> study after he was dead. My Lord <font>Cecil</font>
desired to know whither out of that which was left to him
or to his brother? And he said out of that which was in
my Lord Treasurers house in the Strand. Whereupon
my Lord <font>Cecil</font> published, that after his Fathers death, Sir
<font>VValter</font> desired to search for some Cosmographycall
descriptions of the West-Indies which he thought were in
his study, and were not to be had in print, which he
granted, and said he would as soon have trusted Sir <font>Walter</font> as any
man: though since (for some infirmities of Sir <font>Walters</font> ) the
bonds of his affection had been crackt, &amp; yet reserving his
duty to the King his Master (which he could not despence
withall in his service) hee swore by God he loved him, and
found a great conflict in himselfe, in that so compleat a
member in a common-wealth was fallen away. But he
must needs say that Sir <font>VValter</font> used him discourteously to
take the book away and not to acquaint him therewith:
Neverthelesse he said he need not to make any Apology in
the behalfe of his Father, considering how usuall and
necessary a thing it is for Councellors and those in his place
to intercept and keep all such kinde of writings, for
<pagebreak id="9" />
whosoever should now search his study (or at least his Cabinet)
should like enough finde all the famous libells that ever
were made against the Queene that dead is: and shall also
finde divers made against the King our Soveraigne Lord
that now is, since his coming to the Crowne: Sir <font>Walter</font>
said that the book was a manuscript, and had noted in the
beginning with my Lord Treasurers owne hand, this is the
book of one <font>Rob. Snag</font> , and affirmed that as my L. <font>Cecil</font> had
said, he thought a man might finde also in his house all the
libells that had been made against the late Queene: But
M. Attourney said that he was no privy councellor, nor
he hoped never should be: my Lord <font>Cecil</font> answered that
he indeed was no councellor of state, yet he had been
often called to consultation: Sir <font>VValter</font> thought it a very
severe interpretation of the law to bring him within the
compasse of Treason onely for this book written so long
agone as it was, whereof no man had read more than the
Titles of the Chapters: and which was burned by <font>George
Brook</font> without his privity; admitting that he had
delivered it to my Lord <font>Cobham</font> , not advancing, nor approving
the same, but discommending it, as <font>Cobham</font> first
confession was; and he put this case, If he should come to my
Lord <font>Cecil</font> (as oft he had done) and finde a searcher with
him with a packet of libells, and my Lord let him have 
one or two to peruse, this he hoped was no treason. To
prove this treason against the State and common-weale
my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> confessions were read to this effect.

PEACE WITH SPAIN AND TO INTRODUCE TOLERATION OF RELIGION IN          
ENGLAND.</comment>
<pagebreak id="10" />
<omission type="sentence" /> Sir <font>Walter</font>
confessed that he knew very well, that <font>Mathew de
Lawrencie</font> held intelligence betweene Count <font>Aremberg</font> , and my
Lord <font>Cobham</font> , and so did the Lords of the councell know,
that it had been so these seaven yeares by licence of the
Queene: But that he knew to what purpose it was now of
late, he denied, other then he took it to have been
concerning the businesse of the peace with Spaine, for that my
<pagebreak id="11" />
Lord <font>Cobham</font> said that his brother <font>George Brook</font> was very
loath to accuse him, Sir <font>Walter</font> proceeded, and asked,
whither my Lord <font>Cobham</font> had accused him or confessed
any such thing. It was answered that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> had
been asked whither he had spoken any such thing
concerning his said brothers unwillingnesse, and he would make
no other answer but that he had: however he said it
proceeded out of a discontented minde from the said <font>George
Brook</font> , which M. Attourney said was a confession of their
pretence in law. Then Sir <font>VValter Rawleigh</font> , said that if my
Lord <font>Cobham</font> had accused him as they alledged, he ought
to renew his accusation to his face, that so he might not
be massacred by heersay, and affirmed it was Sir <font>Nicolas
Throgmortons</font> case. There was further urged against Sir
<font>VValter</font> for intending to make away the King the testimony
of one that had been lately at sea, who was in the Court
in a blew cassock and deposed. That being at <font>Lisborne</font> not
long after the coming in of the King into England, a
Portugall Gentleman asked him whence he was, and said of
<comment type="compiler">WORD REPEATED: of</comment> England: Then he asked whither our King were
crowned or not, and he answered he hoped so by this time,
whereupon the Portugall said that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> and
<comment type="compiler">WORD REPEATED: and</comment> Sir <font>VValter Rawleigh</font> would make him away  
before it
were long, Sir <font>VValter</font> made light of this rumour and of
the witnesse, and said that he thought it might be so; for
that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> knowing that he had written a book
and presented it to the King, to move his minde not to
make his peace with <font>Spaine</font> , hearing him one day at his
Table dispute very violently against the peace, told him
in his Gallery presently after, he need not be so much
against the peaces, for he should have seven thousand
Crownes to labour for it, and that he thought it to be a
toye nor knew how to deserve it, yet his answer was</nonSpeech><dialogue> let
me see the mony, and then I will answer you to the
<pagebreak id="12" />
purpose. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And my Lord <font>Cobham</font> told him further, that he
would offer a great summe of mony to my Lord <font>Cecill</font> and
to my Lord of <font>Northumberland</font> to the same end, but he
disswaded him from it, and told him, they would hate
him as long as they live for it. And Sir <font>VValter</font> said
further, that the occasion of my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> accusation was
this <font> <foreign>viz.</foreign> </font> When as Sir <font>Walter</font> perceived by the Lords that
they had the said <font>Mathew de Lawrencie</font> in jealousie to do
some bad offices between Count <font>Aremberge</font> and my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> (who as he thought was justly condemned upon
these advertisements) that he observed my Lord <font>Cobham</font>
that night (when my Lord <font>Cobham</font> brought him home to
his house) to go back past his owne stayres towards his
Countesses lodgings, with the said <font>Mathew de Lawrencie</font> ,
as if he had been very sorry to have parted with him. Then
he writ to my Lord <font>Cecil</font> to signifie to him that in his
judgement if he apprehended <font>Mathew de Lawrencie</font>
presently, it might be a means that he might intercept their
intelligence (perhaps not yet ripe) And if otherwise <font>Mat. de
Lawrencie</font> might perchance be shuffled away, and so left it
to his Lordships consideration: And afterwards my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> had constantly denied these matters upon his
examination, this letter was shewed unto him as though Sir
<font>Walter</font> had induced him to all the inconveniences he had
fallen into, which after he had read, he desired to read it
againe. And upon assurance it was Sir <font>Walters</font> Letter, in
a great passion he brake forth into these speeches;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh
Villaine! Oh vile Traytor! hath he used me thus? Nay
then I will tell you all, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and thereupon in madnesse and
perswasion of the wrong that Sir <font>Walter</font> had done him, he
delivered the right accusation, the substance whereof was
not denied, though M. Attourney noted that he
considered of a second time before he entred into passion, Sir
<font>Walter</font> appealed to all that knew my Lord <font>Cobham</font> , that
<pagebreak id="13" />
he was as passionate a man as lived, and said, that in his
choller he had accused his friends of greater matters than
these, and had been sorry for it afterwards. The Kings
Councel replyed that the confession of <font>George Brook</font> of the
foresaid speeches of my Lord <font>Cobham</font> touching himselfe,
and Sir <font>Walter</font> , for a further plot than they two by any
way could excuse, must stand good in law, in that those
speeches were uttered (as it appeared) before those
matters came out, and before my Lord <font>Cobham</font> had conceived
the spleene against Sir <font>Walter</font> upon the sight of this letter.
And further produced my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> confession.
That Sir <font>Walter</font> after his first being before the Lords, did
write unto him the said <font>Cobham</font> , that he had been
examined of many things concerning him, but he had cleared
him in all: Now the Lords protested that all this while
he was not asked one question touching my Lord <font>Cobham</font> ,
and therefore the Attourney inferred that he writ this out
of a fearefull and guilty conscience, to confirme my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> on his deniall, against he should be examined: Sir
<font>Walter</font> hereupon declared that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> put him
in trust to passe the Inheritance of certain fee farme lands
for him, and gave divers jewells of great value for his
security, which were in his bosome at the time of his
apprehension, and that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> had a Cabinet worth
thirty pound, which Master Attourney should have had
for his favour: and that at his returne from the Lords with
private restraint to his owne house; my Lord <font>Cobhams</font>
footman came to him to know what was done in the
businesse: and he unwilling to have it knowne that he was
restrained, dispatched the footman, saying he would
write to his Lord, and so did by Captain <font>Kemish</font> . Besides
for that which he writ of the said businesse, and
acquainted my Lord <font>Cobham</font> that he had been examined, and that
he had cleared his Lordship: he did write so in this regard,
<pagebreak id="14" />
that though he were not examined of my L. <font>Cobham</font> , yet
he talking with my Lord <font>Cecil</font> , and his Lordship telling
him he was glad there were no more in the action than
there appeared, and that he hoped such a one was not in
S. <font>Walter</font> said that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> was absolutely cleer:
and my Lord <font>Cecill</font> replyed he did hope so, and thought
no lesse: all which was said in regard my Lord <font>Cobham</font>
was thought to be discontented. But afterwards my
Lord <font>Cecil</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>VValter</font> you have <font>Kemish</font> against you
who carried the letter and toare out that sheet, which
concerned the Lords of the Councell (for so was my Lord
<font>Cobhams</font> confession) and he hath been offered the rack for
it, but what he has confessed, I as yet know not: </dialogue><nonSpeech>Answer
was made by Sir <font>VVilliam VVade</font> , that <font>Kemish</font> had confessed
he carried a letter, and knew nothing at all of the contents
and that indeed he was told that he deserved himselfe to
be put to the rack for it:</nonSpeech><dialogue> well </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Sir <font>VValter</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> the
Rack-keeper was called for, was he not? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>VVilliam VVade</font> said,
that it was privately reported, that <font>Kemish</font> had his Masters
letter back from my Lord <font>Cobham</font> , but Sir <font>VValter</font>
confessed no such matter. But concerning that he was charged
withall, for practising to make a combustion in Scotland,
he confessed the words of my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> accusation to
this effect, That he thought the best course to trouble
England, was to cause sedition in Scotland, and said that
he had thought so any time these twenty yeeres, and so it
had been also held by the wisest men in this Kingdome:
And he had delivered his opinion to be such divers times
to the Lords of the councell, and he thought that there
were few there but were of his opinion: Sir <font>VValter</font> also
offered to the consideration of the Iury, that my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> had not subscribed his accusation; Then the
Lords requested my Lord Cheife Iustice to deliver
whether subscriptions were necessary by the Law, and
<pagebreak id="15" />
my Lord Chiefe Iustice said they were not:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
Sir <font>Walter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> pardon me my Lord, for this, by your
Lordships favour, I take to be the course of examination in this
kinde. After that the examinate hath confessed, and his
confession is written, it is all read over againe distinctly
and deliberately to him, that he may be sure to say nothing
but truth: and then in confirmation that it is
undoubtedly true, and that he will stand thereunto, he is to subscribe
the same. Now my Lords, if my L. <font>Cobham</font> did accuse me
thus rashly out of his passion, and afterwards when he had
read it againe, began to relent, and (with sorrow for the
wrong he had done me) refuse to set his hand thereunto,
then I say my Lords I have reason to take hold of it: And
it is well knowne to you my Lord <font>Cecil</font> , and my Lord of
<font>Northampton</font> , how he hath recanted his accusation,
moreover he hath most penitently sorrowed for this injury he
hath done me, and could never be quiet in his conscience
till he had purged me. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Master Atturney said, that in my
Lord <font>Cobhams</font> accusation there were many things, that he
had recanted, but there was no essentiall point
prenominated, which he had recanted: And my Lord <font>Cecil</font> said,
that the reason, that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> gave, why he would
not subscribe, was, because he thought he was priviledged
by his degree: wherein he appealed to my Lord Chiefe
Justice, who answered that it was a great contempt to
refuse to subscribe, but it did not appeare that thereupon
he did subscribe. Then Master Atturney delivered that it
was Sir <font>Walters</font> policy to have but one witnesse, because
he thought that one witnesse could not condemne him.
Sir <font>Walter</font> thereupon furiously started up, and said to him,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Master Atturney, you must not thinke that all that
maketh for me is policy, and all that maketh against me is
plain, and God revealeth it. I were well fitted for justice, if
you should come to be my Judg, what indifferency is there
<pagebreak id="16" /> 
in this my Lord Chiefe Justice? Remember I beseech
your Lordship the statute of the first of <font>Edward</font> the Sixth
hath this. That no person shall be condemned of treason
unlesse he be accused by two lawfull accusers, and those to
be brought before the party, if they belong to England.
And remember too the statute of the 13 of the Queen.
No man shall be arraigned of treason, without the oath of
two sufficient and lawfull witnesses brought face to face.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>My Lord Chiefe Justice said, the statute of the first of
<font>Edward</font> the Sixth, was repealed by the first and second of
<font>Philip</font> and <font>Mary</font> , and reduced all tryall of treason to the
course of the Common-law. And that the statute of the
thirteenth of <font>Elizabeth</font> extended to such offences as were
mentioned in the said act to be committed against the
Queene that dead is. And that all was now put to the
Common-law, and that by the Common-law one witnes
was sufficient concerning presumption, some of the Judges
said: That by the law a man might be condemned
without a witnesse, onely upon presumption. As if the
King (whom God defend) should be slaine in his Chamber,
and one is seene to come forth of the Chamber with his
sword bloody being drawne, were not this evident both
in law and opinion without further inquisition? And
my Lord Chief Justice said that one witnes accusing
himself too, was very great testimony; especially in this case.
For it was not to be imagined that my Lord <font>Cobham</font> would
do himselfe so much harme, as to adventure the losse of
his honour, lands of so great worth, and his life, for any
spleene to Sir <font>Walter</font> , unlesse the matter were true, and
therfore the accusation was very strong against Sir <font>Walter</font> .
Note that the treasons against Queen <font>Elizabeth</font> , which by
the statutes of the thirteenth of her raigne were to be
proved by the oath of two witnesses, were death or bodily
harme intending to death, imagined against her, levying of
<pagebreak id="17" />
warres within or without the Realme against her, plots to
depose or deprive her, publishing her to be a Tyrant,
Heretick, Infidell, Schismatick, Vsurious, &amp;c. Sir <font>Walter</font>
proceeded and urged, that though these statutes lived not,
yet he knew very well the reason of these statutes and
equity of them lived still.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But howsoever I am sure </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
hee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the law of God liveth for ever. And you shall finde
it in <font>Deutronomy</font> in the seventeenth Chapter. <font> <foreign>In ore
duorum aut trium testium peribit qui interficitur. Nemo
occidatur uno contra se dicente testimonium.</foreign> </font> And in the         
nineteenth
Chapter. <font> <foreign>Non stabit unus testis contra aliquem: quicquid
illud peccati, et facinoris fuerit. Sed in ore duorum aut
trium testium stabit omne verbum.</foreign> </font> Divers other places of the
old Testament are to this purpose <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: pupose</comment> ,          
confirmed by our
Saviour too in the eighteenth of <font>Mark</font> , and the eight of         
<font>Iohn</font> , 
and by Saint <font>Paul, Corinth</font> 2. 13, And by the whole
consent of the Scripture. And if the Common-law be as
<font>Brookes</font> saith (who was a great Lawyer) then there ought
to be two witnesses: For he saith a tryall is by verdict, and
by witnesse, </dialogue><nonSpeech>wherein my Lord Chiefe Justice said he
was deceived.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he</nonSpeech><dialogue> you tell me of one witnesse,
let me have him. Prove the practises by one witnesse,
and I will confesse my selfe guilty to the King in a
thousand treasons. I stand not upon the Law, I defie the law,
if I have done these things I desire not to live: whether
they be treasons by the law or no. Let me have my accuser
brought to my face, and if he will maintaine it to my face,
I will confesse my judgement. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Here my Lord Chief
Justice being required to signifie his opinion of the law in
this case, he said it was not the law to have the witnesse
brought to his face, considering he accused himselfe also:
To the which the rest of the Judges agreed Sir <font>Walter</font>
replyed, it was not against or contrary to the law:</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Howsoever I do not expect it of duty: And yet I say you should
<pagebreak id="18" />
deale very severely with me if you should condemne me
and not bring my accuser to my face. Remember a story of
<font>Fortescue</font> a reverend Chief Justice in this Kingdome; Tells
of a Judge in this Kingdome that condemned a woman for
murthering her husband, upon the presumption or
testimony of one witnesse (as it seemed)  and after she was burned, a
servant of the mans that was slaine (being executed for
the same fault) confessed that he slew his Master himselfe,
and that the woman was innocent. What did the Judge
then say to <font>Fortescue</font> , touching the remorse of his
conscience for proceeding upon such slender proof, <font> <foreign>Quod
nunquam de hoc facto animam in vita sua ipse purgaret.</foreign> </font> That
he could never be at peace of conscience whilest he lived,
although he but gave consent upon the verdict of the
Jury. But my Lords for the matter which I desire,
remember too the story of <font>Susanna</font> : <font>Daniel</font> thought the
Judges fooles because they would condemn a daughter of
<font>Israel</font> without asking the witnesse a question: Why then
my Lords, let my accuser be brought, and let me aske him
a question, and I have done: for it may be it will appeare
out of his owne tale, that his accusation cannot be true, or
he will be discovered by examination. But yet principally
my Lords remember what is said in the <font>xix.</font> of <font>Deutronomy</font> ,
<font> <foreign>Si steterit testis mendax contra hominem accusans cum
prevaricatione, stabunt ambo, quorum causa est ante dominum, in
conspectu sacerdotum, et judicum, qui fuerint in diebus illis</foreign> </font> .
And I will tell you, Master Atturney, if you condemne me
upon bare inferences, and will not bring my accuser to
my face: you try me by no law but by the Spanish
inquisition. If my accuser were dead, or not within the land,
it were something. But my accuser lives, and is in
the house, and yet you will not bring him to my face.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>About this time my Lord <font>Cecil</font> asked him, if he would
take issue upon these points upon my Lord <font>Cobhams</font>
<pagebreak id="19" />
testimony: if my Lord <font>Cobham</font> would now justifie under
his hand his accusation, and it might be that he would (by
the advice of the Lords) joyne issue with him, Sir <font>VValter</font>
made no direct answer thereunto, but still besought them
to bring his accuser to his face. My Lord <font>Cecil</font> then
replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Walter</font> , it cannot be granted you: you have
heard your selfe that the Law will not dispense with it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>It may not be forgotten that before <font>Rawleigh</font> had been so
importunate to have his accuser brought to his face, he
used very probable reasons to the Jury to satisfie them, how
silly and foolish an enterprise this was, whereof he was
accused, and how unlikely a thing it was that he should
enter into it.</nonSpeech><dialogue> First, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he</nonSpeech><dialogue> that I should make choice of my
Lord <font>Cobham</font> of any man living: A man of no following,
nor of no force; that I should dreame of disturbing of
the state, now every body was so glad of the Kings
comming, and of unexpected peace: and now the state was
greater, and stronger than ever it was. That I should be
so simple to expect mony from Spaine: for I knew how
much that Kings revenue was impared, and his treasure
intercepted. I also knew well that where he had usually
in his Havens, 6 or 7 score sayle of ships, now he had not
six or seaven sayle of ships: I knew well too that his
Jesuites begged from door to door in Spaine: and I knew well
that the King of Spaine was bankrupt, as was protested
by most of the Merchants of Christendome: And could I
imagine then that in his poverty he could disburse six or
seven hundred thousand Crowns? or if he had been in case,
could I thinke it so easy a matter, to obtaine such a sum of
mony of the Spaniard? do Princes so easily now a dayes
part with such Masses of mony? I knew that the Queene
of England disbursed no mony to the States of the
Low-countryes (though it were partly for her owne security)
before she had the <font>Brill</font> and <font>Flushing</font> in pawne. I knew
<pagebreak id="20" />
likewise Shee disbursed no mony into <font>France</font> (though
for the like occasion) till shee had <font>New-haven</font> in pawne,
and afterwards more warme security: Nay, the Citizens
of <font>London</font> would not lend their Queene money, till they
had her lands in pawne. What pawne had we to give the
King of <font>Spaine</font> ? What did we offer him? Or how could
we invent to offer to him the letter of an <font>Arabella</font> ,
whom he could not chuse but know to be of no following,
what a mockery is this? what would I make my selfe? A
Cade? A Kett? A Jack-Straw? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Against these
probabilities, the presumptions before alledged, were laid
altogether, to fortify my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> accusation, in the
ordering whereof Master Atturney shewed great wisdome and
care in his Majesties businesse. And whereas Sir <font>Walter</font>
had urged, that it was not likely the King of <font>Spaine</font> would
be so easily perswaded to provoke the King of England to
a warre, considering his bad fortune in six or seaven
enterprises against this State, and what he had lost by warre
with England: Master Atturney said he was so much the
more likely to desire revenge, and to entertaine the least
hope thereof. But <font>Rawleigh</font> answered:</nonSpeech><dialogue> All your
suspitions, and inferences, are but to fortify my Lord <font>Cobhams</font>
accusation; My Lord <font>Cobham</font> is the only man that doth 
accuse me. My Lord <font>Cobham</font> lives and is in the house, let
him maintaine his accusation to my face. My Lord <font>Cobham</font>
hath confessed himselfe guilty, he is meerly at his
Majesties mercy: and without doubt shall highly offend the
King, if he go back from his word, wherein he hath
abused his Majesty, and so is to looke for no mercy, but shall
surely dye. On the other side he hath accused me to
instigate and draw him into these treasons, and if it be so, then
I have been the overthrow of him, his honour, estate and
all. He is a man of a most revengeful nature, as all the
world knowes, who would he be more willingly revenged
<pagebreak id="21" />
on, then on him vvho hath been his utter ovrethrovv?
Why then my Lords if he vvill not displease the King in
hope of mercy and compassion (vvhich is his onely plea)
If he will be revenged on the man that brought him to all
this, that hath ruinated him and his house, then will he
justifie his accusation to my face, then good my Lords let
us be brought face to face. </dialogue><nonSpeech>My Lord of <font>Northampton</font>
replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Walter</font> you have heard it cannot be granted
you, pray importune us no longer. No longer </dialogue><nonSpeech>said 
<font>Rawleigh</font> ?</nonSpeech><dialogue> it toucheth (my Lord) upon my life which I value at
as high a rate as you do yours. </dialogue><nonSpeech>At last Sir <font>Walter</font> was asked,
whither he would say any more. Then he directed his
speech to the Gentlemen of the Jury, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you have
heard the proofs, I pray you consider that these men
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (meaning Master Atturney and the rest of the Lawyers) </nonSpeech><dialogue> do
usually defend very bad causes every day in the Courts
against men of their owne profession, as able as themselves:
&amp; if they can do so, what may they do with me, that never
studied the law till I came into the Tower of <font>London</font> :
That have been practised in other affaires, and am weake
of memory and feeble as you see, </dialogue><nonSpeech>for he was faine to have
pen and inke to helpe his memory in the long speeches
that were made against him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But remember the godly
saying of Saint <font>Augustine</font> , <font> <foreign>Si judicaveritis tanquam jam
judicandi estis</foreign> </font> . If you would be content to be judged upon
suspitions and inferences, if you would not have your
accusation suscribed by your accuser. If you would not
have your accuser brought to your face (being in the same
house too) where you are arraigned, if you would be
condemned by an accusation of one recanted and truly
sorrowfull for it, if you in my case would yeeld your bodyes
to torture, loose your lives, your wives, and children, and
all your fortunes upon so slender proof. Then am I ready
to suffer all these things. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now after Master Serjeant
<pagebreak id="22" />
<font>Phillips</font> had made a very long repetition                         
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: repetion</comment> of all the
accusation. Master Atturney asked Sir <font>Walter</font> againe whither he
would say any more. <font>Rawleigh</font> answered if he would say
any thing he would answer him. Master Atturney told
him the Kings councell must speake last.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay by your
leave </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> he that speakes for his life shall speake
last. Are you contented </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Master Atturney</nonSpeech><dialogue> that the
Jury shall go together: yea, in Gods name </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Sir <font>Walter</font> . 
Then Master Atturney entred into a speech to this effect:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Now <font>Jesus Christ</font> shall be glorified, <font>Jesus Christ</font> shall have
a great victory this day, as great as when it was said
<font> <foreign>vicisti Galilee</foreign> </font> . Now Sir <font>Walter</font> I will prove you to   
have a
Spanish heart. See with what a vvhoorish forehead he hath
defended his fault: he hath deceived my poore Lord
<font>Cobham</font> as <font>Eve</font> was deceived with an apple, by a letter in an
apple, and hath seduced this poor Lord to write I know
not what to him against his conscience: But he could not
sleepe quietly till he had revealed the truth of it to the
Lords, and voluntarily of himself written the whole
matter to them with his owne hand but yesterday, vvhich I
vvill read vvith a loud voice though I be not able to speake
this sennight after: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so pulled my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> letter
out of his pocket, vvhich vvas in effect thus to the Lords.

got a poore fellow in the Tower, to cast up a letter tyed to

Lord <font>Cobhams</font> window, when the Lievtenant was at
supper, (which I was loath to have spoken of, least the
Lieutenant should be blamed, but all the Lieutenants in the
world could not have helpt it) wherein I intreated him for
Gods sake to do me right, and to right the truth unto me:
because I knew not whither I should be arraigned before
him or no: and hereupon he writt to me how he had
wronged me: and herein I did nothing that was dishonest
for ought I know; but I sent him a letter againe, (because
I heard he should be arraigned first) and desired him to
publish my innocence at his arraignment; But that
notwithstanding he writ unto me againe, which letter I have
now about me (being all my hope) and I beseech your
Lordships to peruse it. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Master Atturney would not have
it read, but said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Cecill</font> marre not a good cause,

<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>hereupon Sir <font>Walter</font>
desired the Jury to consider what a man this was, and what
his testimony was, yet if it were worth any thing. The
protestations which he had made to cleare him, were more
violent then those which he had made against him. And 
the reason that might draw my Lord <font>Cobham</font> to vvrite this
last letter in accusation of him, were greater then could be
alledged to perswade him to write the letter in his
excuse: here my Lord cheife Justice desired my Lord <font>Cecil</font> , 
and my Lord of <font>Northampton</font> to satisfie the Jury, that there
was no condition of favour promised to my Lord <font>Cobham</font>
for writing this last letter: which they both did protest to
their knowledge.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Sir <font>Walter</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare say your
Lordshipps would not offer it. But my Lord <font>Cobham</font> received
a letter from his wife, that there was no way to save his life
but to accuse me: </dialogue><nonSpeech>which was said upon the going
together of the Jury. Concerning the matter in my Lord
<font>Cobhams</font> letter of standing to his deniall, and to admit no
preachers by the misfortune of my Lord of <font>Essex</font> ; and his
desire of a pension from <font>Spaine</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> I protest to God </dialogue><nonSpeech>said Sir
<font>Walter</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> they are false like as the rest. Saving that this I do
confesse; That my L. <font>Cobham</font> offered me a pension, and I
(alas my Lords) loath to cast him away, and being
confident that I had disswaded him from those humours, did
conceale it. But that ever I dealt with him for any such
<pagebreak id="25" />
pension is most untrue. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And for the meeting of the Lords
at Mr. Atturnies house, he heard so he protested by happe
by a child of his. After all this, the Jury went together
and staid above halfe an houre, and returned with their
verdict, Guilty. Then my Lord cheife Justice asked what
he could say why Judgement should not be given upon
him. Hee said he knew the Court was to give Judgement
after their verdict, and so was willing my Lord should
proceede. Then my L. chiefe Justice pronounced Judgement
against him in this manner, <font> <foreign>viz.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Walter           
Rawleigh</font> , you
are to be conveied to the place from whence you came, and
from thence to the place of execution, and there to bee
hanged till you are halfe dead, your members to be cut off,
your bowells to be taken out, and cast into the fire before
your face (you being yet alive) your head to bee cut off,
your quarters to be divided into foure parts, to be
bestowed in foure severall places, and so </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said my Lord
cheife Justice) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord have mercy upon your soule.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Walter</font> upon this, humbly desired, that the King
might know the proofes against him. And that hee
did persist in his loyalty, notwithstanding the said verdict
(which he would pray his said Jury might never answer
for) And further said, the death of him and my Lord
<font>Cobham</font> should witnesse betweene them. Only he craved
pardon for concealing my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> offer to him. And
humbly besought the King to have compassion on him, hee
was a poore gentleman and had a poore wife, and a poore
child, raw, and unbrought up: he had much forgotten his
duty in concealing my Lord <font>Cobhams</font> fault. So Judgement
being given as aforesaid, and he having talked a while with
the Lords in private, went back with the Sheriffe to the
prison, with admirable erection, yet in such sort, as a

 <head>THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST SIR <font>WALTER
RAWLEIGH</font> KNIGHT, AT THE KINGS BENCH BARRE, IN

   <nonSpeech>Upon Wednesday the 28 of <font>October, Anno. Dom.</font> 
1618. The Lievtenant of the Tower according
to a warrant to him directed, brought Sir
<font>Walter Rawleigh</font> from the Tower, to the Kings
Bench Barre at Westminster: where the
Recordes of his arraignment at <font>Winchester</font> was opened; And
he demanded, why execution should not be done upon
him, according to the judgement therein pronounced
against him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>To which he began in a way of answer, to justifie himself
in his proceedings in the late voyage,</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>But the Lord Chiefe Justice silenced him therein,
saying, there was no other matter there in question, but
concerning the judgement of death, that formerly hath been
given against him, The which the Kings pleasure was,
upon some occasions best knowne to himselfe, to have
executed, unlesse he could shew good cause to the
contrary.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Unto which Sir <font>Walter Rawleigh</font> said, that he was told
by his Councell, That in regard his Majestie since the said
judgement, had been pleased to imploy him in his service,
<pagebreak id="27" />
as by Commission he had done, it made void the said
judgment, and was a verification unto him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>But the Lord Chiefe Justice told him, that he was
therein deceived, and that the opinion of the Court was to the
contrary.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Wherewith he was satisfyed, and desired that some
reasonable time, might be allowed him to prepare him selfe
for death.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>But it was answered him, that the time appointed was
on the morrow, and that it was not to be doubted, but
that he had prepared himselfe for death long since.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
   And I am glad </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the L. Chief Justice,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that you have
given the world so good satisfaction of your Religion, as
by some bookes published by you, you have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And so Master Atturney Generall, requiring in the
Kings behalfe, that execution might be done upon the
prisoner, according to the foresaid judgement. The Sheriffs
of Middlesex, were commanded for that purpose, to take
him to their custody, who presently carryed him to the
Gate-house.</nonSpeech>
