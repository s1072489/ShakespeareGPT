<omission type="line" /> <nonSpeech>-- <font>Robert
Mitford</font> of Durham, gent., aiged 34. Lumsden was called into
Mr. Archdeacon's court, and was signified unto his Majestie's
commissioners for not appearinge in the said court, who
thereupon at severall times, did grant warrants and intimacions
against him, which examinate did ride about manie times in
great danger of his life. Did first repaire unto the dwellinge
house of Lumsdenn, Horshooles, and did take John Pottes to
assist him, about May, 1630. Did aske one whoe was
comeinge forth a doore if the said Robert were within, by which
personn he understoode that he was. Found Lumsdenn sittinge
in a chaire in his house. The people turned them out of doore
and bett them with great stanges that were about the house.
Lumsdenn and his confeaderates have since deteined the
weapens from them. In August last, by force of another warrant,
did arreast Lumsdenn in Newcastle upon Tyne, wherupon he
did revile examinate, and would not obey his arreast, saieinge,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;Hange the, rogue, art thou comen with a fase warrant to
arreast me againe? I will not stirr my foote for the.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Examinate
was forced to goe to Mr. Robert Andersonn, a magistrate of
Newcastle, whoe, after peruseall, tolde Lumsdenn the warrant
was sufficient to apprehend him. Notwithstanding which,
Lumsdenn snatched at the warrant, endeavoureing to have gott
it from examinate, and when as he could not prevaile, he
clapped his handes, and stamped with his feete, and gnashed with
his teeth, and called examinate &quot;Rogue, theife, and beggerlie
rascall,&quot; and spitt in his face, and he said he would answeare
the cause in a higher place, to this examinate's greate shame.
When as he could not get Lumsdenn to goe with him, he did
send for Nicholas Raine, the messenger of this court, to come
and assist him, and uponn his comeinge Raine did require
<pagebreak id="24" />
Lumsdenn to goe with him accordinge to the tenor of his
warrant, whoe likewise, in verie contemptuous manner, did abuse
Raine, and call him &quot;base, beggerlie fellow,&quot; and bid both him
and this examinate kisse, <comment type="editor">&amp;c.,</comment> saieing further to

31. (Art 4 and 5) Was at the parish church of North Bayley,
and did administer the Holie Communion to divers of that
parish. Whilest examinate was in administringe the
Sacrament, and dureinge all the time thereof, John Richardson did
goe from one of the communicantes to another to inquire their
names, and laughed and talked amongst them. By such meanes
there was a confused noyse made, by reason whereof examinate
was disturbed in the destribucion of that Holie Sacrament.
Upon Mr. Richardson's comeing nere unto him, examinate
spoake as followeth:</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- &quot;Mr. Richardson, yow and I by this
meanes shall meete by and by, and trouble one another.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr.
Richardson spoke allowde in the time of the said administracion
unto examinate, and said</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I thinke yow will have done before
me.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Art. 6) After examinate had spoken as before deposed,
Richardson removed to the other side of the chancell, and there
continewed talkinge unto some of the communicantes in lowde
manner, and laughing and jestinge amongst them. (Art. 7, 8,
9, 10.) Cannot depose otherwise then predisposed. (Art. 11.)
Richardson was at the church, but cannot depose. (Art. 12.)
Cannot depose otherwise than he hath predeposed. (Art. 13.)
Neyther Richardson nor Mathew Vasie did that daie receive
the communion at the handes of examinate, though both of
<pagebreak id="85" />
them were busied with takeinge the names of the
communicantes and discourse. When the administracion of the
Communion was ended, examinate was forced to staie a prettie space
before he and the communicantes together could saie the Lordes
praier, and give thankes for receiveing of that Holie Sacrament,
in regard of Mr. Richardson's his talkinge unto the people.
(Art. 14.) On the daie articulate did see Richardson come to
the church and sit downe in his owne stall, after which, and
before the administracion of the Sacrament, he did goe forth of
his stall and placed himselfe in a stalle neere unto the font,
and sent his boy Jackson unto divers of the communicantes.
Thinketh the same was to inquire there names. John
Richardson the younger, his grandchild, was presente with him that
daie, or the most part thereof. (Art. 15.) Mr. Henrie Smith,
one of the churchwardens, did send unto Richardsonn to will
him (as examinate supposed) to desist from his unseamelie
course and disturbance, both of divine service and the Holie
Sacrament. Richardson did not therein desist, but sent the
boy called Jackson to and froe amongst the communicantes.
Confesseth it to be true that examinate spoake unto the boy in
the heareing of Richardsonn that he would have him punished
for his disorder and runninge to and froe in time of divine
service, whereunto Richardson answeared</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Well, well, they that
are soe readie to finde fault with him, will not be soe readie to
paie there Easter reckoninges.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Art. 16.) Cannot depose. (Art.
17.) Richardson did not receive the Communion. (Art.18.)
Richardsonn, upon the daie mencioned, did communicate with
divers others. Did then alsoe see the boy Jackson goeinge upp
and downe from one to another in the church, and returned
back to his master. Is perswaded that he was soe sent by
Richardson to inquire there names, as formerlie he had done.

markett, and requested that he would referr all differences to some
indifferent persons to compromitte. Thomas absolutely refused,
saying; they would end it by law. Asked why he should
trouble his unckle Bryan Walker, whoe he conceived had nothing
to doe with his brother Raph Walker's proceedinges. Thomas
instantlie replied,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Let him thanke himselfe for counselling his
