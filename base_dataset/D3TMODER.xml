   <nonSpeech> <font>James Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I gave
this woman in marriage to one <font>Thomas Stedman</font> , which is now
alive in <font>Dover</font> , and I see him last week.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About nine years ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they live together afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, about four years, and had two Children.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You gave her in marriage, but did the Minister
give her to her husband then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and they lived together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Friend, did you give this very Woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What company was there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was the married Couple, her sister, my self,
the Parson and the Sexton.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is that Sexton?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are sure they were married in the Church,
and this is the woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am sure of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long ago?

and how long?
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I knew her a long time. I was an Apprentice
seven years near her Mothers house in <font>Canterbury</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then she's no Forreign Princess? Of what
Parentage was she?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not know her own Father </dialogue><nonSpeech> (and in that he
might be believed) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but her Father-in-law was a Musitian
there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You see her married: what words were used at
her marriage, and in what manner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were married according to the order of the
Land, a little before the Act came forth touching marriages
by Justices of the Peace.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVas it by the Form of Common-Prayer, any
thing read of that Form?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not take notice of that, I was but a young
man, and was desired to go along with them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>William Clark</font> being sworn, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was last
week in <font>Dover</font> in company with this <font>James Knot</font> and
<font>Thomas Stedman</font> , and he the said <font>Stedman</font> did own that he did
marry one <font>Mary Moders</font> , a daughter of one in <font>Canterbury</font> ,
and that <font>Knot</font> gave her, and that he had two Children by
her, and declared his willingness to come up to give evidence
against her, but wanted money for his journey: And I have
understood that a person here in Court was of a Jury at
<font>Canterbury</font> , at a Tryal between <font>Day</font> and <font>Mary Stedman</font> at  
the
Bar for having two Husbands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she cleared?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Clark.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Young <font>Carletons</font> father sworn.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   My Lord, I was at <font>Dover</font> the last week on Wednesday; I
saw the husband of this woman, and the man acknowledged
himself to be so; and did say that <font>James Knot</font> was the man
that gave her in marriage to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhere is this man her husband? Hearsays must
condemn no man: what do you know of your own knowledge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Carleton the Elder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know the man is alive.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know he was married to her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Carleton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not I, my Lord.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sarah Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, This Woman was bound for
<font>Barbadoes</font> , to go along with my Husband, and she desired
to lodge at our house for some time, and did so; and when
the ship was ready to go, she went into <font>Kent</font> to receive her
means, and said she would meet the ship in the <font>Downe</font> ; and
missing the ship, took boat and went to the ship. After several
days remaining there, there came her Husband with an
Order and fetched her ashore, and carried her to <font>Dover</font>
Castle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was his name that had an Order to bring
her on shore again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sarah Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His name was <font>Thomas Stedman</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any more to prove the first marriage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Charlton the Elder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, none but <font>Knot</font> ; there was   
none
but the three, the Minister dead, the Sexton not to be found;
and this <font>Knot</font> who hath given Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What became of the two Children, <font>Knot</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They both died.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Charlton the Elder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Stedman</font> said in my hearing,     
that he
had lived four years together, had two Children by her, and
both dead; five years ago last <font>Easter</font> since she left him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Charlton</font> , What have you heard this Woman
say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Charlton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, she will confess nothing that        
pleases
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Charlton</font> , Did you look in the Church
Register for the first marriage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Charlton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did look in the Book, and he that is now
Clerk, was then Sexton (just now not to be found,) he told
me, that Marriages being then very numerous preceeding
the Act before-mentioned, the then Clerk had neglected
the Registry of this Marriage. If she intended this Trade,
she likewise knew how to make the Clerk mistake Registring
the Marriage.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Young <font>Charlton's</font> Brother sworn, who said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was present at the
Marriage of my Brother with this Gentlewoman, which was
on or about 21 April, 1663. They were married at Great

St. <font>Bartholomews</font> , by one Mr. <font>Smith</font> a Minister here in Court
by Licence.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Smith</font> the Parson sworn.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   My Lord, all that I can say, is this, That Mr. <font>Charlton</font> the
younger told me of such a business, and desired me to marry
them; they came to Church, and I did marry them by the
Book of Common Prayer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Smith</font> , are you sure that is the Woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, it is; I believe she will not deny
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, I confess I am the Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any more witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Charlton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We can get no more but <font>Knot</font> to prove the
first Marriage, the last is clear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judge <font>Howel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is <font>Knot</font> ? Remember your self well
what you said before. You say, you know that Woman at
the Bar; that you had known her a great while; that she
was born near you in <font>Canterbury</font> ; that you were present at
her marriage; that Parson <font>Man</font> married them; that none
were present but your self, the married couple, Parson, Sexton,
and her sister.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some others came into the Church, but none
that I knew; I am sure none went with her, but those I
named.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who gave her in marriage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you to do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was <font>Stedmans</font> shopmate, and he desired me to 
go
along with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were her Parents then living, or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her Mother was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How old are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two or Three and thirty years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long ago was this marriage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About 9 years since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he was Twenty three, and might do it:
What is your Trade of life?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a Cordweyner, otherwise a Shoomaker
<font>Stedman</font> was so too; we wrought both together.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We desire to know whether she had a Father and
Mother then living?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She had a Father-in-law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know her Mother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long before that Marriage did her own Father
die?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not know him; </dialogue><nonSpeech>he said so before indeed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What age was she when married?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose about Nineteen or twenty.
