<comment type="compiler">EPHESTRIS ANSWERS DIPHILUS:</comment>
   Why (my Lord) shall matter of so
small moment cause friends to jarre?
What is beauty, whereof wee have so
long disputed, and so highly of us
regarded? Nothing but a fading pleasure,
an ornament of the face which maketh
the heart proud, and draweth the mind
from every good motion to many
odious offences, whereby the honourable
in committing dishonourable actions,
are so blemished, that they become a
common by-word to the veriest drudge
that Nature hath framed, <font>Helena</font> was
faire, and accounted the onely of her
time, yet who so much scorned?
<font>Cressida</font> beautifull, yet who more false? If
beauty be attended on with such shame
as these two famous women gained,
<pagebreak id="19" />
why should we care who is beautifull?
My sweet <font>Diphilus</font> mistake me not, if
I have passed my judgement rashly, for
neither care I whose fame in that case
is esteemed or defamed, but passe them
by as things of no regard; onely for
argument I have spoken more then either
I regard or account of: therefore let
not this be any breach of our friendship,
for I protest, if thou shouldst say, the
white Swan were as blacke as the
Raven, the Ocean dry, and Ships floating
on the maine; J would affirme it,
rather then our friendship should be for
such a matter discontinued.
   Well <font>Ephestris</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Diphilus</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I
finde your kindnesse great, and will
thanke you for it, but trust me, this
gloze may not serve your turne, for as
you have spoken heresie against Beauty
and maintained a stranger before your
home-borne Ladies, you shall either
recant your judgement, before our
soveraigne Princesse <font>Amoretta</font> , or receive
such penance by your quest assigned,
which I promise thee shall be all
honorable Ladies. O my Lord </dialogue><nonSpeech> (answered
<pagebreak id="20" />
<font>Ephestris</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope I shall find your Honour more
kind, then for so small an offence
to deliver your Friend Prisoner at the
Bar, where the parties shall be Judges,
and my Jury such, as all Lawes allow
me to appeale from, if you should; and
my fault such, as if my life were in their
tryall depending, I might well make
my Testament, and dispose of what I
possesse, heartily desiring God to
receive my Soule; for sure I am, my body
should not long enjoy Breath: for no
greater Corrasive can be offered that
Sex, then to attribute the honour of
such a prize to any one particular, they
all standing on tearmes of Beauty, as
the Crow which thinkes her owne
Birds the fairest: so Women how
ill-faced and wrinkled soever they be,
may not endure to heare any 
commended, if happily they should heare it
spoken by such as they dare not in
Speech displease, yet will their 
countenance shew their Hearts discontent, by
scrowling of the Browes, hanging the
Lip, or setting a sweet Face, as sugred
as the Gall, or by some such outward
<pagebreak id="21" />
action or other, shall you find where
that nipt her, for which offence looked
she never so highly, with Bell, Booke
and Candle, you shall be cursed, and
never more come in her <font>Pater noster</font> , how

for nothing. Thou hast plai'd the
excellent Orator. Who had thought

   My Lord <font>Diphilus</font> ; what, is your

Farre was it from my thought, that
ever you would with such earnestnesse
have defended our faire Ladies, but since
I see you are so great an Advocate, I
will cause you to have thankes for it at
our returne, other reward I dare promise
none. And you my Lord <font>Ephestris</font> , that
so clarkely have depraved them, would
I might be your Scholler, whose
experience is so great, <font>Tully</font> , <font>Ovid</font> , or
<font>Marcus Aurelius</font> , that wrote most in their
disgrace, never writ so largely. I must
needs say, as my Lord <font>Diphilus</font> , our
Ladies are little beholding vnto you, for
the danger committed in the same, the
least is heresie, and how heresie is to be
punished your honor knoweth: yet my
Lord, as I would gladly become a
peacemaker, and that friends may not grow
at ods, whereby any danger might
happen to your person, albeit the offence
be not pardonable, yet the fault made in
a forraigne country ought there to have
<pagebreak id="23" />
this tryall. If it shall stand with your
good liking, no Ladies present to heare
your hard censure, your favour may be
the more: and since I have by patience
of this honourable company, intruded
my selfe to speake in our Ladies cause,
not being a feed Counceller for them, I
will intreat these noble Gentlemen to
give me leave, and let me censure of
the same, so it stands with your
Lordships good pleasure.
   Now truely, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth <font>Ephestris</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I find
your Lordship is kind, and more kind
then I can desire or deserve, when I
shall need your favour in matter of
more import, I will make bold: till

  Cease my <font>Ephestris</font> , this dread,
Heavens forsend, for this offence thy
punishment should be as thou
deservest, much lesse that any sinister
meanes should be used to bring thee to
open Pennance: yet good <font>Ephrestris</font> , let
me intreat thee, as in this Assembly
thou hast unjustly given the prize of
Beauty to <font>Medullina</font> , and therein
thou hast wronged highly the onely of
the World, by thy partiall Judgement,
in derogating from her the Title of
most excellent, which is most 
Honourable, and no more than her worth
requireth; confesse but thy fault and
errour in the same, and an end if thou
<pagebreak id="25" />
lovest thy owne good, refuse not this
offer, least worse befall thee then
<font>Acteon</font> , or to <font>Paris</font> for his rash judgement.
Thou hast learned us in thine own
<font>Exordium</font> , that women are inspired with
minds of revenge. Be therefore by thy
friends entreated, before the punishme~t
come vpon thee, so maist thou keepe
thee from much sorrow, for if no
greater mischiefe fall vpon thee thou shalt
be sure of more curses, then thy weake
carkase can beare: for my <font>Ephistris</font> , in
friendship I say this, and warne thee as
one that loveth thee, knowing their
inclinations, which as thy selfe confesseth
is bent to revenge: if so, as many as shal
heare of this blasphemy, if they do thee
no other ill, their cursing thou shalt be
sure of, and womens curses, are as bad
as the curse of holy St. <font>Gillian</font> , which
is said to be ten times worse then the

of this <font>Heathen</font> Prince, whereby I am

Wherefore Noble Lady, I will truly answer

   The Prince, whose Father was
matchlesse, gaining the love of all men, with
care and honour maintained the
reputation of his Country, which by his
carelesse Son is blemished, who 
neglecting the duty of a Child, without regard
of Father, Crown, or Kingdome, exiled

himselfe, no man knowes where, or
whether he rest alive or no: since which
time, the King his Father, who loved
him too deare (if Fathers love may be
too deare) hath likewise absented
himselfe, and liveth in exile. The Mother
Queen, hath resigned her due to death,
leaving (by losse of those honourable
persons) their Country without a head,
and their State by Subjects to be
governed, wherby a ruine of the Kingdom
is like to ensue, all proceeding from the
Prince. A miserable country is y=t= </dialogue><nonSpeech> (qd. the

losse of so noble a race, y=e= Father having
bin such, and the Son as (report saith) so
coward. But say (good Knight) </dialogue><nonSpeech>qd. she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
was there never any cause supposed of

through his harsh demeanor, for youth

Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (qd. the Knight) </nonSpeech><dialogue> at his departure
began our Countries griefe and my

be separated, such was my love to him,
which refused himselfe, his Crown, and
dignities. A dolefull tale hast thou
delivered </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the Princesse) </nonSpeech><dialogue> which I
perceive moveth you to impatience,
wherfore, one demand and an end. The
Prince <font>Armatius</font> , made choise of you,
for his companion: Then under

<font>benedicity</font> let me crave (all law of friendship

his determinations? for me thinks it is
scant credible, y=t= such an unity should
be amongst men, their loves being so
perfect, but he should disclose each
secret intent whatsoever: many reasons
draweth me to suppose it, which I will
omit, for I perceive I am too tedious.
Your Ladiship urgeth me farre, yet will
J accomplish your request, who have
power to command me. The 
Gentleman who never offended, but in
committing of this great offence, long
before his departure, having be like some
motion of desire in his thoughts,
became of a pleasant Gentleman, the most
melancholiest that could be found, that
quite abolishing all company, he best
contented himselfe with his secret
cogitations; continuing this honour so
long, that he fell sicke of an extreame
Fever: which so encreased upon him,
as all Physickes reliefe was quite given
over: so that small was the hope of his
recovery, whose distresse, the kind King,
with the Mother Queen, grieved in
<pagebreak id="174" />
such wise to behold, as in short time it
was hard to be judged which of the three
endured most extreams. But God that
in adversity sends comfort, restored the
Prince to some strength: belike
receiving some comfort in his imaginations,
and by his recovery, y=e= King and Queen
were both so comforted, as in short time
they were raised from their sick
Cabinets, to frolike it amongst their noble
subjects, who joyed in nothing so much
as in their healths. But how soone the
Sun-shine <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Suu-shine</comment> of their happinesse was 
overshadowed with clouds of comfortlesse
care, grieveth me to recount; yet dare I
not gainsay your Ladiships request.
The Prince recovered of his malady,
made semblance of such content, that
none but himselfe could witnesse by the
least suspition, his hearts discontent, yet
oftentimes should I, being seldom from
his company, sighing with a number of
farre fetched sobs, heare him say,
Peerlesse Lady, would my love were as well

the report of which hath fettered my

thine; or never mine owne: then
looking with a gastly looke about him, to
see if any overheard him, he would fall
into some other discourse, ever
applauding the rare perfections of his Mistresse
who was unknowne to all but only to

acquainted with the same: briefly Lady

the love of his Lady hath drawne him
from his Country, whose <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wbose</comment> absence
caused the Kings exile, and the Kings exile
the Queens death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Princesse hearing all these
extreams to grow from affection, knowing
well her owne hearts discontent, with a
sigh from the deepest, which wrung
teares from her heart, she said;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas
noble Gentleman, whose joy so soon
overwhelmed, hath heaped so many cares
upon me, what folly was there in thee,
y=t= wouldst not disclose thy love which
burn'd so veheme~tly: was y=e= dame so base
<pagebreak id="176" />
that thou fearest therby to ignoble thy
issue, or of such high estate thou
doubtest to obtaine her; if either, by
perswasions all griefs might have bin
mittigated of a Monarch, why thou by report
deservest her; if a Beggar: thou mightst
make her noble, what ere she were
hearing of thy distresse, could she forbeare
to pitty thee? No, no, were her hart more
harder then the Diamond, it could not
chuse at the hearing thereof, but relent
the~, well worthy were she to be scorned
of all Ladies, and never to be named
amongst the number of women.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Prince seeing the Princesse in
this pittifull humour, thought it good
striking when the iron was hot, and
taking the opportunity, answer'd her
thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is your Ladiships censure such of
hard-hearted <comment type="compiler">HYPHEN UNCLEAR IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> Ladies, and will not be
intreated of him, whose love to you, is
no whit inferiour to the Prince
<font>Armatius</font> , as himselfe would confesse were he
present, and heard me recount the many
griefes, wherewith love hath afflicted
me: and might he be Iudge, would allow
me recompence for my Service in love.
<pagebreak id="177" />
But Madam, if without offence I might
demand this; say <font>Amoretta</font> , the Princesse
of <font>Trebisond</font> were the Saint, unto who~
this unhappy Prince had vowed his
devotions, &amp; that all the passions he hath
endured, are for your love, would you
vovchsafe him love in recompence
thereof? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Princesse driven to her
shifts at this demand, could not tell
what to answer yet sharpning her wits
(as women can doe) she said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Marianus</font> ,
Love is not to be dallied with, as I have
heard them say, which speak by
experience; therefore I cannot directly
answer thy question, but were I the
Physitian that could cure his malady, and
had so good judgment of his affects as
of mine owne, charity would I should
minister unto his Disease, what effect
soever the potion would worke?
provided this, that he disclosed his griefe in
time: mistake me not <font>Marianus</font> , and
pardon me if I conceale what I would
utter my thoughts are mine own. Truth
Lady </dialogue><nonSpeech> (qd. the Knight) </nonSpeech><dialogue> neither was the
same demanded to urge any thing
more then standeth with your good
<pagebreak id="178" />
liking: yet for the Prince, this I say, it
were pitty he should die for love. So say
J </dialogue><nonSpeech> (qd. the Princesse) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for few men there
be of that condition, and as seldome is
such a one seen, as multitude of blacke
Swans. Your error is great, Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech> (qd.
the Knight) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for many have beene with
love, so overcome, that Kings have bin
enforced to stoope to their Subjects,
and the greatest Conquerours,
whose valour many volumes record,
by love compelled to forsake 
themselves, taking sundry shapes and many
toyles, to gaine the love of their Ladies.
I speak now, Madam, for the Prince,
whom I love well, and challenge your
charity may be to him continued, for
your love is the only Physick that must
cure him, or else all other helpes are
frivolous: in hope whereof, he breaths a
lingring life, till your gracious consent
finish his griefes, yeelding to his desires
in whom it resteth, to restore him
banished to his regall dignities, who is the
cause of his exile: dastardnesse hath
caused him to conceale it, bearing the
extremity of his passions with
<pagebreak id="179" />
intolerable pain, whose flames encrease <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: encaease</comment> by
viewing your excellent perfections; The
want of whose grace,  haleth him on to
desperatio~, not able any longer to resist
Loves assaults, which with such hot
Alarumes assaile him, that longer he
cannot endure them. <omission type="line" />
