 <head>THE 
<font>WANDRING WHORE</font>
CONTINUED.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Silence in the Court</font> , not a word
amonst us three confederates, but
what's <font>spoken under the Rose</font> , it is not
fit to let <font>Francion</font> go off thus for 135 pounds; wee'l
make him marry thee <font>Julieta</font> , or make thee a <font>good 
joynture</font> all thy life time: Hee'l <font>believe all to be Gospel</font>
that we say, whilst we agree in one and the same Tale,
he won't be long absent from us, therefore lets be
<font>forewarn'd</font> and <font>fore-arm'd</font> against his coming.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The project will hit doubtless, we have such
a grand earnest of his folly before-hand, 'tis but making
him believe shee'l turn and be honest ever after, which
if it were not so, you know <font>Cuckolds have the best luck</font> ,
for my part, I wish I were the <font>richest Cuckold in Europe</font> :
<font>Ju</font> is not overworn, therefore not past turning, and a
good <font>two leav'd book</font> left to look in still.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, and a good <font>fat A--</font> too thou mayst
lay <font>thy lips on't</font> , but 'tis customary here to receive mony
with wives, (who like light gold will not pass without
allowance,) but give mony for wenches, and that hee'l do I
warrant yee, wee'l make thee a <font>President</font> for others to
imitate and follow: what must <font>matrimony</font> be made a
<font>matter</font> of <font>mony</font> where there's a <font>dainty Cunny</font> ? I'le make
him believe she hath as many suitors as there are days
in the year, to make him more zealous of <font>cozening</font> his
<pagebreak id="4" />
<font>Corrivals</font> should such an Amazonian beauty,
accomplisht with such transcendant endowments both of body
and mind, proportion'd with such equal parts, enrich'd
with Silver and Golden habiliments, be parted with at
an easy rate, so, as to make a slave her master, or a
servant her Commander.   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Julietta.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My very teeth water at the Contrivance,
if it falls right, expect I will reward you both out of his
estate, 'tis but his believing that I will be honest after
all my <font>Lusts</font> and <font>Lechery</font> , and that's all one to a fool;
for <font>what the eye sees not the heart rues not</font> , I shall not
be the first <font>whore</font> that has turn'd honest, in the flower
of her age, 'tis but your getting another to supply the
place during my absence, for common Jades (such as
<font>Mal. Savory, Honor Brooks</font> , and <font>Nan. Jones</font> ,) are
numerous enough, and will sit with their leggs spread over
the sides of a chair with their petticoates and smocks
in their mouths, whilst their <font>Comrades</font> run a tilt at their
<font>touch-holes</font> in that posture, paying twelve pence a time
for holing; and for his part and mine we have taken a
sure course to try each others abilities before-hand; we
shall not fear commencing of <font>Law-suites</font> for want of
<font>due benevolence</font> , or for being <font>unpenetrable</font> , yet Ile have
him sign and seal these following <font>Articles</font> for an
<font>Assurance</font> of his future <font>Affections</font> , <foreign>viz.</foreign>
   <font>Inprimis</font> , That I <font>Monnsieur Francion</font> do freely, and
willingly settle 300 l. per annum upon <font>Julietta</font> , for and
during her life time.
   <font>Item</font> , That I will allow her a <font>Coach</font> and four <font>Horses</font> ,
with <font>Attendants</font> answerable.
   <font>Item</font> , That I wont be jealous of any man's coming,
or visiting her, of what Quality, Rank or Condition
whatsoever.
<pagebreak id="5" />
   <font>Item</font> , That I will allow her a <font>Lusty Black</font> , to hold 
up her train whilst she walks from room to room.
   <font>Item</font> , That she shall have free liberty to make choise
of her own <font>Chamber-maids</font> , and others belonging to
the family, and chuse a-new every month, if they do
not keep close their chaps, what ever they do with their 
legs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are singular ways to provide <font>horns</font>
for his <font>head</font> , but I would not wish you to stand upon
such <font> <foreign>Punctilios</foreign> </font> , if he will but marry thee <font>Ju</font> , for   
if he
should deny to let thee have thy will and pleasure
afterwards, 'tis but taking a touch or two with a
<font>Councellor</font> , (who frequently takes his <font>fees</font> that way, if his 
<font>Client</font>
be handsom,) and hee'l sue him for <font>Alimony</font> , and
make him maintain thee out of his Estate in spite of his
teeth, and then play the <font>whore</font> under his nose as many
brave lasses have done before thee, and he shall not
help himself, whereof we have a thousand <font>Presidents</font> of
women running from their husbands, and chusing
other <font>Stallions</font> for their <font>Guardians</font> , as appears by a late
Treatise entituled the <font>Trappan</font> , written by <font>Mr. Vernon</font>
in the case of <font>Goodwin the Dyer</font> , &amp;c.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Julietta.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast done well to satisfy me so
cleerly, Ile follow the example of yong <font>Starky</font> the
<font>Hosiers</font> wife, who receiving some seeming abuses from
her husband, (when the major part of her Portion grew
due) ran away from him, carrying all his <font>bonds, bills,
Gold watch, Jewels, Rings</font> , &amp;c. suing him for
maintenance, as he found by woful experience, and the leaving
off of his trade, under the pretence of his having the
<font>Pox</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall tell thee of another way besides that, if
<pagebreak id="6" />
thou hast a mind to make him run mad; take a
handsom <font>Gentleman usher to satisfy</font> thy <font>Luxury</font> , and please
thy <font>lechery</font> , into the house, love and lie with him and
hate thy husband, lie naked in the bed rather then have
thy smock sow'd to his shirt, when thou wouldst under
pretence of rising to piss, or going to a close stool, go to
bed with thy <font>Gentleman-usher</font> , and if he be angry, call
him <font>rogue, raskal</font> , and <font>jealous Cuckold</font> ; and if that fayls
<font>comb</font> his head with a <font>joint stool</font> , or <font>break</font> his <font>pate</font> 
with
a <font>Bed-staff</font> , and it will cool his courage quickly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou'rt a prime <font>Tutor</font> indeed, if thou
hadst but a <font>whore</font> to match thee, for to read a Lecture
in a <font>two-leav'd book</font> , thou hast evermore had a natural
propensity to, as to <font>venery</font> , and knowst how to ride
post to the <font>Devils Mansions</font> ; for I dare swear there's
scarse a rule in all <font>Aretines Postures</font> , but thou hast it
<font> <foreign>ad unguem</foreign> </font> , readier then thy <font> <foreign>Pater Noster</foreign> </font> ; for  
thy zeal,
(like <font> Harry Martins</font> with the <font>Beggar Wench</font> , <font>Thom. 
Scots</font> with the <font>Bonelace-wench</font> of <font>Wickham</font> , and <font>Hugh
Peters</font> when the <font>Butcher</font> cudgel'd the 5 pounds out of
his Carkass for lying too neer his Brindle) is lockt up
in a <font>Down-diddle</font> more then honesty, yet I like thy
<font>merry devices</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Every man to his trade</font> , as the 
<font>Rat-trap-maker</font> said to the <font>Parson</font> , be sure I have not my name
<font>Gusman, an old beaten soldier</font> for nothing: I have told,
<font>Ju, a woman will have her will</font> , and you are not to
seek in that point, Im'e sure on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou say'st very true, <font>good wits will      
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wll</comment> jump together</font> , as thou didst with my Cousin, 
but
methinks we are grown huge modest in our debates
bewixt each other, but I wonder <font>Francion</font> tarries all this
<pagebreak id="7" />
while, I wish we had some pleasant tale, told to drive
away the tedious night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rather then want, I would invent a <font>story</font> ,
but this I shall tell you stands upon record, is very true,
and was try'd at <font>Salisbury Assizes</font> of a <font>bouncing Girl</font> ,
who was courted by a neighbor whom she did not
fancy: this yong <font> <foreign>Enamorato</foreign> </font> out of spight, reports she had
no <font>C--</font> and scarce a pissing place; a second suitor
engages her affections, but upon noise of the rumor
relinquishes her; a <font>Crafty Lawyer</font> (as most of that function
are) tells her he would sue this <font>slaunderer</font> in her behalf,
and demand nothing till <font>Recovery</font> , to which she
assented, the party being arrested the suit was shortly
brought to tryal, where a Jury of women were
summoned (not men) to search her, who upon demand
from the <font>Judge</font> , what they had to say in the business,
one of the eldest Matrons answer'd that she had a good
thing (meaning the maid, not her self,) the Judge told
her that was not enough to satisfy the Jury, she must
speak broader and plainer? Why, then (quoth she)
she hath a very <font>good commodity</font> : I tell thee again
woman thou must speak plain; why, then if I must I will,
and will swear it again and again, before your <font>Worship</font>
and the <font>Jury</font> , she hath a <font>C--</font> large enough for the
beggest mans <font>P--</font> in the Parish, at which they all
laughed, and the Jury (for that she was a handsom
wench) fined her adversary threescore pounds
damage which was accordingly paid the <font>Plaintiff</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Julietta.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was honestly done of them, and is
neer a kin to a passage I have heard of a fellow who
helping a Gentlewoman on Horse-back, slipp't his
hand under her belly and tore a tufft of hair off her
<pagebreak id="8" />
Commodity, waring it in a Bravado <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Bravido</comment> in his    
hat; which
her husband hearing of, su'd him for it, and it cost him
forty pounds for his frolick.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well I am bound to tell a Tale or let
a fart, therefore give ear to this following, concerning
a Gentleman who had continu'd with a great deal of
eagerness a suitor to a Gentlewoman, whose incivilties
could not retract him, nor perswasions withdraw him,
at length when nothing would serve his turn, she
uncover'd her breast naked, ranckled, rotted and corrupted,
which he espying took leave of her, and never set eye
on her after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe neither of you two would have
uncover'd your infirmities, in such a Case, but for my
part I conceive it lawful for men and women, to <font>go 
naked</font> , and were it customary as in <font>preceding times</font> , your
<font>enticing habits, perfum'd carkasses</font> , and <font>stately gestures</font>
would be less in request, both with your selves and
oother's, and fewer <font>provocations</font> to <font>lust</font> and <font>Lechery</font> ,
which is seldom occasion'd by a brown skin, a crook'd
back or legs, or poor habit, but often by <font>holland smocks,
silk stockins, rich gowns</font> and <font>petticoats</font> , with other 
<font>costly garments</font> , which cover your <font>greatest foulness</font> and
<font>deformities</font> : I have known many women, taken out of
(their better part) their <font>cases</font> would have been a
loathing to themselves and others, who otherwise were
doted upon in their <font>bravery</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Julietta.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Should you men, see all our                   
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: onr</comment> actions
in a true, (and not a counterfeit) glass, we should be
the most <font>dispised wretches</font> in the world, but we can
order you in that point, as most of your <font>Citizens Wives</font>
do their <font>Coxcombs</font> , who if they won't let them have
<pagebreak id="9" />
their <font>desires</font> and <font>pride</font> to boot, 'tis but dissembling a
<font>tertian</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>tertain</font> </comment> or <font>quotidian ague</font> , a  
<font>burning feaver</font> , or some
other distemper, and their <font>lying in</font> shall cost them more
mony in <font>Doctors visits, Apothecaryes Bills</font> , (who now
and then cornute them into the bargain) <font>Candles</font> ,                
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Caudles</comment>
<font>Potions</font> , and <font>Cock-broths</font> , then if they had granted their
desires at first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am no stranger to those tricks, for if I
were, I should have a better opinion of your sex, then
they have deserved (the number of wicked women, 
being numberless) amongst which number are <font>Mr. 
Savage in whitecross-street</font> , who broke her husbands
head with a <font>marrow-bone</font> , and had like to have kill'd
him with it, <font>Mrs. Barron a fidlers wife</font> , who us'd to
comb her husbands head with a <font>base viol</font> , into which
his <font>head</font> was struck as if he had been in the <font>Pillory</font> , or
got a <font>ruff</font> about his neck, <font>Mrs Hewson</font> at the further
end of <font>White-chappel, a tearing Ranter</font> , who is never
quiet but when <font>Clark</font> the <font>Hatband-maker</font> in <font>Hounsditch</font> ,
is at work in her <font>Saw-pit</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR pit</comment> , and           
<font>Mrs. Blakesly</font> , who
notwithstanding her husbands lawful and due correction,
will tempt, <font>Jack Hunt</font> the <font>Butcher</font> in <font>White-chappel</font> , to
make her husband a <font>Cuckold</font> : well if you think to have
<font>Francion</font> I hear, and see coming <font>Iu</font> , you must behave
your self with more discretion, as a <font>Chaundlers wife in
vp church lane</font> , said her husband did her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Julietta.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee <font>Gusman keep thy breath to cool thy
pottage</font> , but stick close to us in our <font>new found Plots</font> ;
<font>Mounsieur Francion</font> , truly devoted of your servants
salutes you, and rejoyces at your appearance, why so
long absent from her so deerly loves you, why at such
a distance from her whose life and fortunes lie and
<pagebreak id="10" /> 
truckle at your foot-stood, whose presence is my life
and absence death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Francion.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thy company's no less to me my
<font>sweetheart</font> , my <font>deer</font> , and my <font>beloved one</font> , of whom I'le 
say:

<font>In twining armes let me my</font> deer <font>conceal
And from thy</font> rosy lipps <font>long kisses steal
Let me thy</font> complete parts <font>touch without light,
And with</font> sweet joyes <font>protract the pleasing night,
In thy</font> sweet armes <font>hugg thou my hands and face
Let me in my</font> kind bosom <font>thee embrace,
'Tis not for gold that</font> Lovers <font>do complain
They'r rich enough if they theyr</font> Ladies <font>gain</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you have gain'd <font>Julietta</font> is no
news, I would advise you Sir to marry her, you may
meet with a <font>slut</font> , and that's worse then a <font>whore</font> , but she
hath vow'd <font>chastity</font> for the future.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can assure that to be true, that she's
resolved to turn if you'l marry her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Francion.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought I had remov'd all scruples in
that point, is the motion of your mentioning <font>Julietta</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Julietta.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly sir, I am very weary of this life, and
would gladly turn, would you let me be devoted wholly
to your service.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Francion.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis no sleight Question to answer, much
more to execute, so that you must pardon me in that
Point.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then you must allow her a 
yeerly revenue to maintain her for your self, and keep her in
her <font> <foreign>quondam</foreign> Equipage</font> and <font>gallantry</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gusman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's all the reason in the world for't,
<pagebreak id="11" />
what would not some men give for a <font>dainty bit</font> in a
corner, the <font>forbidden fruit is sweetest</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Francion.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well what's your demands, what will
maintain her from the <font>scourge</font> of <font>necessity</font> , come speak
out or let <font>Magdalena</font> do't for you, but marry I may
not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sixty Pounds</font> a year is as little as can be
to maintain her <font>honesty</font> and <font>bravery</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Francin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, provided she layes no claims to
marriage with me, I'le settle 50 Pounds <foreign>per Annum</foreign> 
<font> <foreign>Durante vita</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magdalena.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come she shall do't, Ile be her <font>Advocate</font> ,
fill us some wine to seal the bargain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Content till our next days meeting.
