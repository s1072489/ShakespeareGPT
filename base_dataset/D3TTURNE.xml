time the Robbery was committed? I shall ask him some 
Questions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have only one word more to say to you, that
before he went to the <font>Hoop</font> Tavern. Nay (said I) Coll. <font>Turner</font> 
be
ingenious whether this was not Mr. <font>Tryan's</font> money that he
removed, and he confessed it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That money was removed from his own
house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but his Wife, Children, and Maid,
denyed it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Turner</font> , will you ask him any
Questions? what are they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would ask all this back again, you are upon   
your
Oath, Mr. Alderman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You need not tell him that he is     
Sworn,
the Court and Jury understand it so.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on Mr. <font>Turner</font> , ask your Questions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord I demand of Sir <font>Thomas Aleyn</font> ,      
whether
I did not tell him at the first, there was a wicked young man
had belyed my house and Family, saying that he supped there
that night, when he had not supped at my house these Twelve
Moneths.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think I have done him that right already, he
desired me to Examine that young man, who said he supped at
Coll. <font>Turner's</font> , but I found he had been nor was not there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon <font>Friday</font> night when the Alderman         
pressed me
concerning the thing I told him, I had some suspition of some
persons, who formerly should have robbed Mr. <font>Tryan</font> a year
agoe, and I employed <font>Mosely</font> the Constable and Mr. <font>Tryan's</font>
man to go to <font>Ratcliff</font> , and I went another way.
<pagebreak id="23" />
Pray ask Sir <font>Thomas</font> whether I did not promise him to do all
I could.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tho. Aleyn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pressed him hard, he said he would
endevour it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether did not I tell him that that money was
carryed there on purpose to gain the other Fellowes that had
the Jewels. Said I, if this money be taken away, he that hath
the Jewels will not bring them, and the remainder of the
Money; but that this Money must bring him to it that they
might share it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was not one word of this, his
Examination was contrary; he told me 400 <font>l.</font> was received of a
Goldsmith, he knew not his name, and 200 <font>l.</font> was in his owne
house, and that he removed it for two or three dayes till this
foolery was over; he said it was his own money, I said an
honest man need not thus remove his own money.
   One thing I have omitted, when I was examining of him in the
<font>Minories</font> , word was brought me his Son was fled away at the
back dore; I bid them run after him, but they said they saw him
leap over a great Ditch; he was not heard of till Yesterday,
though I sent out my Warrants for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your self (as Sir <font>Thomas Alleyn</font>     
sweares)
said you knew not of whom you had part of the money, but the
other was your own, and yet afterwards that the money was
<font>Tryan's</font> ; why did you say so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tell you the reason, I would not have my
businesse spoiled, and did feign those answers. My Lord, I do
demand of him whether Mr. <font>Tryan</font> and I had not made a
Bargain in the morning, whether or no if he might have his Goods
the person should be free, and that he had agreed no blood
should be spilt, that he had rather lose all his money and Jewels
then to forfeit such an asseveration which the Theif had bound
me, that I should swear to him, that by the blood of Jesus Christ
that was shed for him and all Sinners, his life should
be free.
<pagebreak id="24" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are beside the businesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I ask Alderman <font>Alleyn</font> whether I    
did not
tell him this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told your Lordships two souls were pawned, as
he said before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do not spend your time thus, the        
question's
short, whether you are Guilty of Robbing, or breaking the house
of Mr. <font>Tryan</font> , or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am as free as any man here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They will not beleive your own words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think I have done him no wrong by this
Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope, my Lord, I shall have the benefit to    
call him
again for a Witnesse for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may ask him now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, when I come to my defence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh your Honours most humble Servant, I am very
sorry I have put him to this trouble.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Tryan</font> , his Servant, and Mr. <font>Garnet</font> Sworn.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Tryan</font> pray (as you are able)    
give an
accompt of this businesse.
<comment type="compiler">TRYON'S ACCOUNT OMITTED. HE RELATES HOW HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS BED, 
BUT MANAGED TO CRY FOR HELP AFTER THE ROBBERS, WHO KNEW WHERE THE KEY 
TO THE CASH-BOX WAS, HAD STOLEN C. £1000.</comment>
<pagebreak id="25" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came they by the Jewels?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tryon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I forgot something concerning some Jewels,
these Jewels were in a drawer under my Table in the
Compting-house, he was privy to that, because he did frequent
my house very long, and was very familiar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was privy to all this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tryon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> James Turner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Turner</font> , would you ask Mr.      
<font>Tryon</font>
any Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By and by when I come upon my proof.
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>William Hill</font> , Mr. <font>Tryon's</font> man sworn.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   All that I can say is this; when <font>I</font> went out I locked the 
door double, and those things were there then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About what time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seven or eight of the Clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he a bed then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord; when I came home again, I found
all these things gone; going down into the
Compting-house we found some Jewels gone and some left, and those
were inconsiderable to those that were gone; the best were
cull'd and gone: on Saturday Collonel <font>Turner</font> was
Arrested with two Serjeants, and sent the boy at the Hoop
Tavern for me; I took two friends with me, Mr. <font>Gvrney</font> and
Mr. <font>Pilkinton</font> , he prayed me to speak to my Master that
he would give Bond for him that the Serjeants might
discharge him, and he hast about his business, or else it would
be spoyled; proceeding into some discourse, <font>I</font> was saying
to him, it was a great providence that <font>I</font> and the maid was
not then at home, for if we had we should have been killed;
he answered, saith he, no, they would onely have bound
you and the maid: <font>I</font> asked him how it was possible to get
in? he answered, one went through the Entry in the day
time, and there lay till night, went up staires, found a
candle, light it, went up to his Chamber, took the Key
and went down and let in others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This story I was informed <font>I</font> told him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I asked him how he came to know it, he said he
examined them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he never tamper with you about
making Mr. <font>Tryon's</font> Will?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, he came to me about a year ago,
I went with him to the <font>Cock</font> behind the Exchange, it was
in a morning, he took me privately aside, told me the old
Gentleman your Master is very sickly, cannot live long,
had a good Estate, or to that purpose, and it was pity he
would never make a Will, and such an Estate should go
<pagebreak id="27" />
to the Building of <font>Pauls</font> ; saith he, I have prest him
several times touching making his Will, he said he had done
it, when we both knew he had not, and I believe he will
not make one. He told of one that could Counterfeit a
hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not <font>Grainger</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, that that man could Counterfeit
a Will, and I and Mr. <font>Garret</font> , and another good fellow
should be the three Executors, and a third person
Overseer, and that would please the old man; I answered, I
would not have to do in such an unjust thing for all the
world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you go to <font>Turners</font> to Supper that
night this Robbery was committed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, to Mr. <font>Starkey's</font> in               
<font>Fanchurch-street</font> ,
the Maid went along with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One question more, you said you came in and
found the doors open, did you come in before the 
Neighbours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, I had not known of it but that one
Gentleman at Supper went home with a Gentlewoman in
<font>Leaden-hall-street</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR street IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> ,    
and hearing there was such a Robbery
in <font>Lime-street</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR street IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> , <font>I</font>  
run with a great fright, came in and
found the doors open, and found the Neighbours within.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The thing understood touching the Will hath
another face; his Uncle was an acquaintance of Mr.
<font>Grainger</font> , his Uncle that bound him Apprentice that lived in
<font>Cripplegate</font> , now in <font>Cornhill</font> . This <font>Grainger</font> had
counterfeited a Will touching my Lord <font>Gerrard</font> , and some body
else about an Estate; said I to this young man, you have
an Uncle acquainted with a notable fellow, one <font>Grainger</font> ,
and your Master making no Will (speaking merrily) this
fellow is able to make it for him. Ask him if I did not tell
him his Uncle was acquainted with such a person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You told me so indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hill</font> , by the Oath you have taken, did  
he
not perswade you to endeavour that you and he and
<font>Grainger</font> should counterfeit a Will.
<pagebreak id="28" />
<comment type="compiler">LAST LINE OF PAGE 27 REPEATED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did my Lord; he told me, That I, Mr.           
<font>Garret</font> ,
and another good Fellow, should be the three 
Excecutors, and another person Overseer, and that this <font>Grainger</font>
could do it undesernably; I answered him, I would not
meddle with it for all the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go, go, go, this is malice, for it was meer
jesting with him.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Elizabeth Fry</font> sworn.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 

   Mrs. <font>Turner</font> came to my house on Saturday morning
last, at six a clock in the morning; she knocked me out of
my bed, <font>I</font> asked who was there, she said, A friend; who
are you said I? Come and see, sayes she; I said, who, Mrs.
<font>Turner</font> ? she said, yes; I went and dressed me, and let her
in; she said, there was a Friend of hers, a Merchant newly
broak, he had a Wife, and seven or eight children; they
desired to secure the money till they had taken their Oaths
the money was not in their house. She said, her Husband
and her Son <font>Ely</font> was coming with it. I went and lighted a
Candle, there was she and her Son <font>Ely</font> with the money;
she asked me, If I had a spare chest; I said, Yes, there
was one within; she went in, opened the Chest, and she
put in the wallets of money, I know not how much, my
Lord. I asked her if there was any more to come, she
said, Yes, her Husband was coming with more; she went
to the door and let it in, but I know not who brought
that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Justice Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not Mr. <font>Turner</font> come in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, he opened the bags, and asked his
Wife touching the Seals; She said, the Gentlewoman that
owed the money, had desired me to pull them off. They
offered me twenty shillings for my kindness in it, told me,
they had power to give it from the Gentlewoman; desired
me if my sister or any should ask about it, bid me conceal
it, because the discovery would ruin the poor
<pagebreak id="29" /> 
Gentlewoman and her Children, but rather to say, that they
desired me to let some linnen lie there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the bags sealed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see none sealed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Bridgman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many wallets were in the shop?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw but three, and they put one into a Chest in
the shop, and two in the kitchin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At that time when the mony was brought,
was there any discourse of a 1100. pound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To my best remembrance it was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not a word of the sum.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was five wallets brought into my house, three
in the shop, two in the kitching.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had they bags at each end?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>T. Aleyn.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You hear what the wench sayes, she sayes,
there was five wallets, three in the shop, two in the
kitchin; <font>I</font> took two in the shop, and only one in the kitchin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, <font>I</font> have two apprentices little girles, 
when
all the people were in the shop, said out aloud, that they
saw Mrs. <font>Turner</font> go out of the shop with something in her
Apron, covered with a red cloth, while <font>I</font> was above, my
Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who should convey it away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Son was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray my Lord, ask her, which is <font>Ely</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is, </dialogue><nonSpeech>pointing to <font>Ely</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was false, this <font>Ely</font> carried none, the      
Boy knew
nothing of it; both my Sons are dear to me, and if either
more then the other, it must be my eldest, and yet <font>I</font> must
say, it was <font>John</font> my eldest Son that carried the money,
this Boy was at home; She hath forsworn her self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your wife told me that <font>Ely</font> was to bring some.

   <nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak your knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On <font>Saturday</font> in the afternoon about three a    
Clock,
my brother and I arrested Collonel <font>Turner</font> in an Action
of seven hundred pounds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. J. Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At whose suit?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the suit of <font>Thomas Lyon</font> , who with others  
was
bail for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was only hearing of this foolery that caused 
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we went to the Hoop Tavern, he sent for
Mr <font>Tryons</font> man, that he should engage for this account, 
that he might have his liberty to look after master <font>Tryons</font>
business; soon after came the Constable, and he charged
us to assist him to go before Sir <font>Thomas Aleyn</font> ; by and by
<font>I</font> was saying, Collonel <font>Turner</font> , how could this house be
Rob'd, and none of the doors broke? O said he, I
took a man in the <font>Minories</font> , who has discovered it me; he
told me that one going into the Cellar in the Day-time,
lay there till night, then went up Stairs, found a Candle
and light it, went up to the Old Gentleman's Chamber,
took the Key from his bed-side, and went down, and let
all the rest of the Thieves in; the young man being there,
said, it was well the maid and I was not at home, we
should have been killed; no sayes he, you would not have

<font>Tower-Hill</font> all Friday night, whether went you in the
morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came home between four and five in the
morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>R. Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your maid offered to depose even now, that
you did not rise all that morning before eight of the Clock.

that

Jewels to a good value, and that Mr. <font>Tryon</font> had a very
good repute of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Rich. Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what report hath he upon the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I owe nothing there Sir <font>Richard</font> , nor none  
there
can lay any thing to my charge, except it be that I am a
Cavalier.

the woman speaking to me, flee for your life, or such
expressions, made me go away I know not how.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord Chief Justice <font>Hyde.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you bring some

Saturday-morning? Did not you carry them to <font>Fryes</font> house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We took them afterwards from the house
where <font>Weild</font> appointed us to meet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what time of the day did you carry
them back to <font>Weild</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before Sir <font>Thomas Allen</font> came that day, 
I
was coming for more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what place?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Tower-Ditch</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No house, but I delivered them at 
<font>Tower-Ditch</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what time of the day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was before Sir <font>Tho. Allen</font> came,     
about 8
or 9 of the clock in the Fore-noon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there no people there? who was
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell; I saw several other
persons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Weild</font> stand in the street?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you to know him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Fathers direction; and I had seen
the man at our house that morning when he brought in the
money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereabouts? was it near the
Quest-house? that is, the great house that stands in the middle of
way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was hard by the signe of <font>Noah's</font> Ark.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a likely story to be believed, that
you should in the day-time between eight and nine in the
morning, meet in the <font>Tower-Ditch</font> that man that was a noted
Thief, that had been in <font>Newgate</font> ; that you should tarry for
this man to receive two Bags of money: see how it hangs
together!

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Just as I am now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hide.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had <font>Weild</font> a great Black Coat? and what did he 
do 
with the money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not; but I delivered one in the
street, and then went and fetched another, and he staid
ready for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this all the money that was brought in
the morning, save that that Sir <font>Tho Allen</font> brought away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was all, to my knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Tho. Allen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Colonel <font>Turner</font> confessed to me on
<font>Thursday-morning</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR morning IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> that

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The first time I carryed 200 <font>l.</font> as I can
judge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mayor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who carryed any more?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Father.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill. Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not meet him, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You came thither, and called for a Pot
<pagebreak id="75" />
of Ale, and said you staid for Colonel <font>Turner</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is not right; I onely asked if Col.       
<font>Turner</font>
used the Horse; by and by he came and paid for the pot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You two went together; what was the
occasion of your meeting together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Finding him there, I said I could not drink
with him, and so we parted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I called for a pot of drink, and having no
money to pay for it, Colonel <font>Turner</font> coming by, I called him in,
and desired him to pay for it, which he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Bridgeman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Boy swore you said you staid for Col.
<font>Turner</font> ; can you justifie you were at home, or in any other
place? it is a great suspition <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: supition</comment> ; the old   
Gentleman charged you
to be very like the man, and you can give no account where
you were, and <font>Turner</font> and you met together the day
before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was at home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Mayor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>William Turner</font> , when did you shave your
Beard last?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>W. Turner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Barber in <font>Golding-Lane</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Mayor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When his hair is shaved off his chin, the other
man whose Name is <font>Christmass</font> , being a smooth-chinn'd man,
it's very possible that might beget the mistake in Mr.
<font>Tryan</font> .
