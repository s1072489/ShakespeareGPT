</dialogue> <head>THE SUBSTANCE OF THE LAST WORDS AND CONFESSIONS OF <font>SUSANNA
EDWARDS</font> , <font>TEMPERANCE LLOYD</font> , AND <font>MARY TREMBLES</font> , AT THE
TIME AND PLACE OF THEIR EXECUTION; AS FULLY AS COULD BE
TAKEN IN A CASE LIABLE TO SO MUCH NOISE AND CONFUSION, AS
IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASSIONS.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mary Trembles</font> , What have you to say as to    
the Crime
you are now to die for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have spoke as much as I can speak already, and  
can
speak no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what shape did the Devil come to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Devil came to me once, I think, like a Lyon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he offer any violence to you?
<pagebreak id="38" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not at all, but did frighten me, and did      
nothing to me:
And I cried to God, and asked what he would have, and he vanished.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he give thee any Gift, or didst thou make him any
Promise? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had he any of thy bloud? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he come to make use of thy Body in a carnal      
manner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you a Teat in your Privy-parts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Grand Inquest said it was sworn to 
them.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mary Trembles</font> , Was not the Devil there with     
<font>Susan</font> when I
was once in the Prison with you, and under her Coats? the other
told me that he was there, but is now fled; and that the Devil was
in the way when I was going to <font>Taunton</font> with my Son who is a
Minister. Thou speakest now as a dying Woman, and as the
Psalmist says, <font>I will confess my iniquities and acknowledge all my 
sin</font> . We
find that <font>Mary Magdalen</font> had seven Devils, and she came to Christ
and obtained Mercy: And if thou break thy League with the Devil,
and make a Covenant with God, thou mayst also obtain Mercy. If
thou hast any thing to speak, speak thy mind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have spoke the very truth, and can speak no more:
Mr. <font>H.</font> I would desire they may come by me, and Confess as I have
done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Temperance Lloyd</font> , Have you made any Contract    
with the
Devil? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he ever take any of thy bloud? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did he appear to thee first, or where in the     
street? in
what shape? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a woful shape.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had he ever any carnal knowledge of thee?            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he do when he came to thee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He caused me to go and do harm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And did you go?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did hurt a Woman sore against my Conscience: he
carried me up to her door, which was open: The Womans name was
Mrs. <font>Grace Thomas</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What caused you to do her harm? what malice had you
against her? did she do you any harm?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she never did me any harm: but the Devil beat 
me
about the Head grievously because I would not kill her: but I did
bruise her after this fashion </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>laying her two Hands to her       
Sides</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you bruise her till the bloud came out of her    
Mouth
and Nose? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many did you destroy and hurt? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
None but she.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know any Marriners that you or your Associates
destroyed by overturning of Ships and Boats?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I never hurt any Ship, Bark, or Boat in my    
life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it you or <font>Susan</font> that did bewitch the Children?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sold Apples, and the Child took an Apple from   
me, and
the Mother took the Apple from the Child; for the which I was
very angry: but the Child died of the Small Pox.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know one Mr. <font>Lutteril</font> about these parts,  
or any of
your Confederates? did you or them bewitch his Child?                
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Temperance</font> , How did you come in to hurt Mrs.    
<font>Grace 
Thomas</font> ? did you pass through the Key-hole of the Door, or was the
Door open?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Devil did lead me up Stairs, and the Door was 
open:
and this is all the hurt I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know it was the Devil?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I knew it by his Eyes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you no Discourse or Treaty with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; he said I should go along with him to destroy 
a
woman, and I told him I would not: he said he would make me;
and then the Devil beat me about the Head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why had you not called upon God?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He would not let me do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you never hurted Ships nor Boats; did you    
never
ride over an Arm of the Sea on a Cow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, Master, 'twas she, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>meaning</font> Susan.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>When <font>Temperance</font> said 'twas <font>Susan</font> , she said she lied,   
and that she
was the cause of her bringing to die:</nonSpeech><dialogue> for she said when she was
first brought to Goal, if that she was hanged, she would have me
hanged too; she reported I should ride on a Cow before her, which
I never did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Susan</font> , Did you see the shape of a Bullock? at   
the first time
of your Examination you said it was like a short black man, about
the length of your <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: you</comment> Arm. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was   
black, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Susan</font> , Had you any knowledge of the bewitching  
of Mr.
<font>Lutteril's</font> Child, or did you know a place called <font>Tranton       
Burroughs</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you willing to have any Prayers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>H.</font> prayed, whose Prayer we could not take; and they
sung part of the 40 Psalm, at the desire of <font>Susanna Edwards</font> : As
<pagebreak id="40" />
she mounted the Ladder, she said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>The Lord Jesus speed me; though
my sins be as red as Scarlet; the Lord Jesus can make them as white as
Snow: The Lord help my Soul</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then was executed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mary Trembles</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Lord Jesus receive my Soul; Lord   
Jesus
speed me</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and then was also executed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Temperance Lloyd</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Jesus Christ speed me well:     
Lord forgive all
my sins; Lord Jesus Christ be merciful to my poor Soul</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sheriff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are lookt on as the woman that has      
debaucht the
other two: Did you ever lie with Devils? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you know of their coming to Goal?           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any thing to say to satisfie the world?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I forgive them, as I desire the Lord Jesus Christ 
will
forgive me. The greatest thing I did was to Mrs. <font>Grace Thomas</font> ;
and I desire I may be sensible of it, and that the Lord Jesus Christ
may forgive me. The Devil met me in the street, and bid me kill
her; and because I would not, he beat me about the head and back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Shape or Colour was he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In black, like a Bullock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know you did it? how went you in, through
the Key-hole, or the Door? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you no discourse with the Devil?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never but this day six weeks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were charged about 12 years since, and did you  
never
see the Devil but this time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, once before: I was going for Brooms, and he  
came
to me and said, <font>This poor woman has a great burthen</font> ; and would  
help
ease me of my Burthen: and I said, <font>The Lord had enabled me to
carry it so far, and I hope I shall be able to carry it further</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Devil never promise you any thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you have served a very bad Master, who gave you
nothing. Well, consider you are just departing this world: do you
believe there is a God? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Temp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; and I pray Jesus Christ to pardon all my     
sins. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And
so was Executed.</nonSpeech>
