   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Lightfoot</font> , Pray give an      
account to the Jury
and the Court of the manner of Election and chusing of a Common
Hall, and the manner of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have been almost 25 Years an  
Attorney,
I always took it that the Serjeant of the Chamber had order to go
down to the Clerks or Beadles of the Companies, to summon a Common
Hall by such a day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By whose Command?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Lord Mayor's.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In all your time did the Sheriffs ever    
summon any?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mr. <font>Lightfoot</font> thus, When  
they were met,
what was the usual Method?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before the <font>Lord Mayor</font> and            
<font>Aldermen</font> were set, the
People walked up and down the Hall till the <font>Lord Mayor</font> did come, 
but
as soon as my <font>Lord Mayor</font> came, the <font>Common Cryer</font> made         
Proclamation,
<font>O yes, you good Men of the Livery summoned such a day for          
Election and
so, draw near, and give your Attendance</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose Officer was the <font>Common Cryer</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My <font>Lord Mayor's</font> Officer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Corporation Officer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now for the dissolving them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they have done the business,        
<font>Mr. Town-Clerk</font> ,
as I take it, takes his direction from the <font>Lord Mayor</font> , and he   
bids the
Officer make Proclamation, <font>You good Men of the Livery, depart hence
for this time, and appear at a new Summons</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Sheriffs</font> ever dissolve them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Common Hall</font> do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, there was no such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Lightfoot</font> , After my <font>Lord Mayor</font>  
had dismist the
Hall, did you ever hear the <font>Sheriffs</font> keep them together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All the People went away, till within    
this three or
four Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since when?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since Mr. <font>Bethel</font> , about that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, in <font>Bethel</font> and              
<font>Cornishes</font> time, then began the
Bustle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you have been an Attorney 25      
Years, I
would ask you, in all that time, Mr. <font>Lightfoot</font> , in all that     
time did you
ever know the Lord Mayor adjourn the Common Hall to a certain
day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was never any occasion.
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Answer my Question.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> Sir Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would ask you another Question,  
Mr. <font>Lightfoot</font> ,
Did you ever know before the Election was over, when the
Electors were chusing Sheriffs, or polling or debating it, did you   
ever
know in the middle of it, the Mayor against the will of the Sheriffs 
adjourn
it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did ever the Sheriffs undertake to keep   
them together
before these late times?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir, this, Though it is usual, after 
the Sheriffs
have taken the Poll, to acquaint my Lord Mayor; Did you ever know
that the Sheriffs have adjourn'd the Common Hall, without 
acquainting my Lord Mayor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you one Question more, Do you remember
when there was a Poll between Sir <font>Thomas Stamp</font> and another?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not charge my Memory with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember when there was a Poll      
between 
Sir <font>Robert Clayton</font> and Mr. <font>Kyffen</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was about the Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember when there was a   
Poll between
Sir <font>Simon Lewis</font> , and Mr. <font>Jenks</font> ? Who did manage that Poll?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you upon your Oath?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they were gone to the Poll, I went  
out of the
Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever look upon it that the        
Sheriffs had any
thing more to do than others?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who were induced to take the Poll? Was it 
by the
Sheriffs, or the Lord Mayor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been appointed by my Lord Mayor.  
I do
know that the Sheriffs have taken upon them to appoint a Poll, and   
then
my Lord appointed his Clerks in the House to be assistant to the 
Common Serjeant, and the Town-Clerk; I never was but in two Polls, one
for Mr. <font>Box</font> , and another for my Lord Mayor. One went on with the
Poll in one place, and the other in another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But before that time, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know nothing of that Sir, I was never  
concerned
before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir, Who used to manage the Poll before 
this
time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Lightfoot</font> , I would ask you 
a Question,
Who managed the Poll before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been in a Common Hall when they   
have been
choosing Sheriffs, when several have fined. And it hath been upon the
question when the Hall hath divided, and they have Polled in the Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who Polled them?
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriffs and the Officers stood and  
saw them go
out, and this is within these few years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Lightfoot</font> , I ask you thus   
now in all your
Observations when there was any Contest, who was Sheriff upon the
Election and the Divisions during the time of Election, and before it
were at an end, who did manage it, the Sheriffs, or the Lord Mayor? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Court had been proclaimed, and  
the Recorder
had spoken to them, my Lord Mayor and the Aldermen withdrew
from the Hustings, and the Sheriffs and other Officers stood there
with them; then the Commons proposed who they would have put in 
nomination, and they were put up; then the Sheriffs have turned back
to the Gentlemen upon the Hustings to ask their opinions, how are your
opinions concerning the Hands? We do think it goes so; then it hath  
been
declared.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Common Cryer, or the Common Serjeant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, as soon as my Lord Mayor    
withdrew, during
the time of Election, the two Sheriffs managed the Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In that manner with others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Lightfoot</font> , Do you remember   
who Adjourned
the Hall, when <font>Mr. Bethel</font> and <font>Mr. Cornish</font> were Chose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Lightfoot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Com. Ser.</font> Are you Sworn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray will you tell my Lord and the 
Jury what you
have observed in particular, because I mentioned it in the time of   
Sir <font>Robert
Clayton</font> ; mention how that was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, when the Common Cryer hath made 
Proclamation,
the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen being set upon the
Hustings, Mr. Recorder makes a Speech; as soon as that is done, my
Lord Mayor and the Aldermen retire into this Court, leaving the      
Sheriffs
and me, and the rest of the Officers upon the Hustings, and I there
manage the Election, and when the Election is made, I go up to the
Court of Aldermen, and make Report of what hath been done in the
Hall. I declare the Election, and I manage the Election, and do it as
the duty of my Place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who manages the Election?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I manage the Election; I declare what is 
my opinion
of the Election in the Hall; and I come and make Report to my Lord
Mayor in this Court; then my Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, and the
Recorder come down again. I remember particularly when Sir <font>Robert
Clayton</font> was Lord Mayor, it was about the Choice of <font>Mr.           
Bethel</font> , and
Alderman <font>Cornish</font> , and there was a great disturbance in the      
Hall; then
I came into the Court, and after I had made my Report, I offer'd to  
give
the Paper to the Recorder that then was: Sir <font>George Jefferies</font> ,  
he told
me that the people wou'd not hear him, and therefore he wou'd not take
the Paper. Upon that Sir <font>Robert Clayton</font> said to me, Prethee, do  
thou
speak to them, they will hear thee if they will hear any body; for the
Hall was in a great uproar, and they call'd to throw me off the      
Hustings,
and then I made Answer to Sir <font>Robert Clayton</font> ; Sir, It is not the
duty of my Office, and when I do any thing that is not my Office, I
<pagebreak id="15" />
shall expect particular Directions. Then, saith he, You must tell    
them,
I must Adjourn them till <font>Munday</font> , because I go to the <font>Old      
Baily</font> to try
the Assassinates of <font>Arnold</font> . Thereupon the Hall was Adjourned, and
Proclamation made to depart; and my Lord Mayor attempting to go,
was beat back twice or thrice, but at last they let him and the      
Aldermen
go, and kept the Sheriffs and me till Evening. At last Mr.           
<font>Papillon</font> came
up to me, <font>Mr. Papillon</font> says I, I am glad to see you, you will    
hear Reason,
says he, why do not you go on with the Poll? I told him, my Lord 
Mayor had Adjourned the Hall: Says he, I did not hear it before; but 
now
you tell me so, I will go out of the Hall: Says I, Sir, you will do  
very
well to tell the Hall so; which he did, and some went away; and      
further
Adjournments were made by the direction of my Lord Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would ask you a Question or two; Who do 
you look
upon to be the Chief Magistrate of the City?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Ser.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, in all your time till this, was      
there no Uproar?
Did ever any Sheriff undertake to Control the Mayor in the business of
putting Questions, or taking Votes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, there was never any dispute till Mr. 
Sheriff <font>Bethel</font>
was upon the Hustings, and then there was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As whose Officer did you do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor's, and the City of          
<font>Londons</font> ; I have
nothing to do with the Sheriffs, for when there is a Writ comes for  
the
Choice of Parliament men, directed to the Sheriffs, I never do it, but
<font>Mr. Secondary</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I speak of later Disturbances.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Ser.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The first Dispute about Sheriffs, since I 
was Common
Serjeant, was about <font>Mr. Jenks</font> , and that Poll was taken by the   
direction
of the Lord Mayor, by the Town Clerk and my self; and our Books say,
If there be a Dispute in the Common Hall, it must be decided as in the
Common Council. It is in <font> <foreign>Liber albus</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Liber niger.</foreign> </font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, <font> <foreign>Liber albus</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Liber albus?</foreign> </font> It is              
<font> <foreign>Liber niger</foreign> </font> , they turn the white
Book into a black Book now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At that time, Sir, when my Lord Mayor 
was willing
to go to the <font>Old Baily</font> , Did the Sheriffs do any thing farther?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriffs did not meddle in the matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr <font>King</font> , Pray give my Lord    
and the Jury an
account of what you know of this matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Peter King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been at a Court of Common Hall   
28 years, my
Lord, and have been concerned, I never looked upon the Sheriffs to   
have
any concern there. And I do very well remember, Sir <font>George         
Jefferies</font> , I
do remember and know; they did always in ancient times take advice of
the Officers by, and they never did esteem themselves in those days, 
to
be any more concerned than as the best Officers to be preferred      
before the
rest: When my Lord says, Come up, they come in order, the Masters
and Wardens of the Companies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did do the business upon the Hustings?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All of them, Sir, altogether.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there never any difference about the  
Votes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes they have stood upon it.
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When there was a Question made to know    
who had the
most, who decided it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They generally asked one another, What do you 
think, and
what do you think? I speak for 20 years together since the King came 
in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope in God there hath been a King in   
<font>England</font> for
20 years, though perhaps some of the Sheriffs that were then in      
Debate,
would have had none.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>King</font> , I only desire to know this  
of you, because I
know you know Questions; I desire, my Lord, to know whether he
speaks it to be a matter of Right, or his Opinion; for we know Mr.   
<font>King's</font>
Opinion will go a great way in this matter. Do you speak it as a     
thing of
Right, or as your Conceptions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, it would be a thing very confident in me 
to determine
of the Right, but only as I always esteem'd it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>King</font> , I would ask you     
this Question; Pray
do you tell your belief upon the Observation that you have made from
time to time of the Practice there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An hundred and a hundred Common Halls I       
believe I
have been at.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's good store.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That may be when there are many     
Fines; when I was
Common Serjeant there were 5000 pounds Fines one year.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire you to give your opinion,    
you say they are
all equal that are there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Every Officer in his degree; for if 20 men go 
together, he
that is best speaks first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Sheriffs allowed to be there, or  
no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriffs are always bound to attend my    
Lord Mayor
by their Oaths, unless they have lawful excuse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>King</font> , Did the Sheriffs ever         
continue the Assembly after
it was dissolved?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or could they do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know my Lord Mayor Adjourn    
the Court
till the Hall had done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you, Sir, Sir <font>Samuel Starling</font>   
did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But the Sheriffs could not do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor he neither, for he paid for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>King</font> , I ask this Question; Who       
declares the Poll in
the Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Common Serjeant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who directs him usually?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Office directs it self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask if the Sheriffs don't agree, who is     
elected before the
Common Serjeant make Proclamation?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. King,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They always agree, unless it be very clear; I 
have known
the Common Serjeant do it several times without disputing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When Persons are put in Nomination, and  
the hands
are held up; I generally ask the People about me, who have most, and
particularly the Sheriffs, and so make Declaration.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Officers ask one another, who they think   
has most? that
doth not give them the Jurisdiction, that they chuse Officers        
without the
Lord Mayor or Sheriffs: but, for ought that I see, these Officers    
have had
more to do about the Choice than the Sheriffs have. These Officers   
consult
one with another commonly, and conclude which side have most;
and then report it to my Lord Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> First of all, when they put any    
Question for any
Officer in the Common Hall, the ususal way of putting the Question   
is, <font>As
many of you as would have such a man to be such an Officer, hold up  
your hands</font> :
And if the Election be clear, Proclamation is made presently: If     
not, the
Common Serjeant asks, <font>Who they think hath the Majority</font> ? Which   
being
declared, they acquiesce. But since <font>Mr. Bethel</font> came in, there    
have been
very hot disputes in the World; but before his time there were       
attempts
made to keep Sheriffs off, but never before to get Sheriffs on. And 
after the Election is declared below, immediately they go to my Lord
Mayor and report it to him: and then comes down the Mayor and 
Aldermen to the <font>Hustings</font> , and the Recorder says, <font>We are       
informed that such
and such persons have been put in Nomination, and the Election       
passed upon
such and such</font> . And then the Lord Mayor commands the Assembly to be
dissolved. <font>Mr. Wells</font> , When the Common Hall is first met         
together, are
not the Lord Mayor and Aldermen generally present?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the first meeting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they are there set, give an   
Account what
Proclamation is there made.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you known it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been in this place almost        
seventeen years; I always
come with my Lord Mayor; I do make Proclamation by Order of
my Lord Mayor, dictated by the Town-Clerk; and I take the words
from the Town Clerk, and his words I say; <font>You good Men of the      
Livery,
summoned to appear here this day, for the Confirmation of such a one 
chosen
by my Lord Mayor, and another fit and able person to be Sheriffs of  
the City
of</font> London <font>and County of</font> Middlesex <font>for the Year ensuing, draw 
near, and
give your Attendance</font> . I never adjourned the Court in my life, but 
by 
Order from my Lord Mayor; nor never dissolved the Court, but by Order
from my Lord Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Common Cryer</font> , I would     
fain know this; When
my Lord Mayor is gone, and the Aldermen, during the Election, do you
ever dismiss the Court before my Lord comes down again; and do not
you take the very words of Dissolution from the Town-Clerk?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what is usual in your time     
when Sheriffs have
fined off, who gives directions for a Common-Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who is it puts the Question, the Common   
Serjeant or
the Cryer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Common Serjeant dictates the words  
to me, and
I never take them from any other; I have taken the Paper into my own
hands, but never but one year neither, when they were in a confusion;
the time when <font>Mr. Bethel</font> was chosen there was some difference, I 
did read
the Names that time, and never but that one time. I always take the
words from the Common Serjeant; I never put any Vote, but what I have
from the Common Serjeant.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do the Sheriffs put any Vote?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not understand him; I think he did mean,  
when <font>Bethel</font>
was chosen he put the Question by some body else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, he took the Paper in his   
hand. Before he
used to take Dictates from the Common Serjeant; but there was a      
confusion
when <font>Bethel</font> was chosen, and then he took the Paper from the 
Common Serjeant, and read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He gave me the Paper into my hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, they made such a noise that he  
could not
hear me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Wells</font> , how long have you been    
Common Cryer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> about seventeen years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In all that time did you ever hear the    
Lord Mayor adjourn
the Court to a certain day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To a certain day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor adjourned this Common     
Hall to a
certain day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you upon your Oath again, Did you   
ever know
the Lord Mayor adjourn a Common Hall to a day certain?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember that of <font>Sir      
Robert Clayton's</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If so be they be adjourned, to meet upon a new 
Summons, if
there be occasion, no question but he may to a certain day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now we are upon matter of fact.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Fr. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know my Lord Mayor     
adjourn them
before the Election of Sheriffs was over? Here is my Question,       
observe it.
When after once my Lord Mayor is gone out of the Hall, when the 
Election begins, did you ever know my Lord come and disturb the      
Election, or
adjourn it before it was done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never knew any thing of it before now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Wells</font> , do you remember that      
instance in <font>Sir Robert Clayton's</font> time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have not you known my Lord Mayor dissolve 
the Court
before the business hath been done; take up his Sword, and be gone?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When he hath a mind to adjourn the      
Court, and declare
it, I adjourn it by his Order.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But have you not known him take up his    
Sword, and be
gone before the Election is over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir Robert Clayton</font> did do that      
before the business
was done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Wells</font> , do not you remember, in    
<font>Sir Samuel Starling's</font>
Cafe, that he did adjourn the Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He dissolved the Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did dissolve the Hall, and so   
hath every Lord
Mayor since. My Lord, if your Lordship please, I perceive this 
Gentleman makes a Question, whether ever there was an Adjournment of a
Common Hall before such a time as the Election of Sheriffs was over. I
will give you an Answer to that Question, and a very fair one, and a 
plain
one: I say, till the time of <font>Bethel</font> , in <font>Sir Robert            
Clayton's</font> Mayoralty, there
was never such a thing as a Poll for Sheriffs.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Silence, that we may hear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we only ask a Question; we ask a 
Question,
and take our Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you give us leave to go on,   
Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>William Hooker</font> , Pray how long    
it is since you were
Sheriff of <font>London</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About 16 or 17 years ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have been Sheriff and Lord Mayor of   
<font>London</font> , I
would only know, whether you looked upon it as your right when you
were Sheriff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nor never durst presume to think 
it: In those
days it was not thought upon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you were Lord Mayor, did you order   
Summons
for Common Halls?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Always.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever use to consult with your     
Sheriffs when to
call a Common Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never, and I think no such thing was 
ever heard
of under the Sun, till of late.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>William Hooker</font> , Did you ever      
Adjourn the Court
before the business was done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw any such occasion,       
Rebellion was not
ripe then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>William</font> , Pray thus; Have you     
ever in a Common
Council, or Common Hall, known my Lord Mayor rise before the    
business was done, and take his Sword?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess I must own it, That when   
things grew
to a greater height, I was forced once in this place to cause the    
Sword to
be taken up and go out, and the Court was dissolved, and durst not go
on after I was gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now my Lord, if your Lordship      
please, I desire
to call the Sword-Bearer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>William Hooker</font> , If I may without  
offence ask you,
how old are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seventy years of age, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, you never knew Rebellion ripe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Sir, I perceive you are very    
apt to mistake
I lived in 41 and 42.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>William</font> , Can you remember the    
Meeting in 48?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then they usurped the very same Power,    
and an Act
of Parliament to confirm it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serjeant Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire Mr.           
Sword-Bearer may be
Sworn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Franc. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, in all the time that    
you have been acquainted
with the Customs of <font>London</font> , did you ever know when there
was an Election for Sheriffs, that the Lord Mayor did interpose or   
meddle
till the Election was over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, of late years I have not        
appeared, because of
an Infirmity, I cannot be long in <font>London</font> ; but in all that time  
I used to
appear, I never did observe any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That the Mayor ever meddled?
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Sir, that the Sheriffs ever     
meddled: When
I was Sheriff of <font>London</font> I durst not presume to meddle, but left  
the whole
to my Lord Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know when the Election   
of Sheriffs
was in a Common Hall, that the Lord Mayor offered to disturb them    
till the Election was over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly I do not remember any such     
thing. Sir <font>Fr.
Winnington</font> , I would give you a full Answer, I do tell you, as it  
hath
been declared; My Lord Mayor and the Aldermen came into the Court,
and a Report is made; when this is done, they leave the management
of the Affair to others, we come and sit down till it is done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom do you leave the Concernment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>W. Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the Officers that it belongs to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who are those Officers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>W. Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never heard it disputed till just now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>W. Hooker</font> , you have been an ancient 
Citizen, do you remember
that ever the Sheriffs presumed to hold this Court?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>W. Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never in my life. -- You may confound 
any man
at this rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir, in your time was there a Poll  
for Sheriffs in <font>London</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>W. Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly not as I remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any Poll in your time? If 
you don't
remember a Poll, you can't remember who took it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir <font>William Hooker</font> , do you     
ever remember the
Sheriffs appointed the Common Serjeant to take the Poll?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>W. Hooker,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Sword-Bearer, I won't ask you  
how old
you are; I desire to know how long you have been an Officer in this
City?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three and twenty years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know in all your time, 
who ordered
Common Halls? Who gave direction for the summoning Common
Halls?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor always.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serjeant Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did my Lord Mayor use to send   
for the Sheriffs,
to know of them when they would be pleased to have a Common
Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never knew that the Sheriffs did    
interpose in calling
a Common Hall in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer</font> , at such     
time as the business was
done, when the Common Cryer had Directions for dissolving the Common
Hall, pray who used to give these Directions all along?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was done by the Town Clerk and my  
Lord
Mayor's Officers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did ever the Sheriffs continue the 
Hall after my
Lord Mayor had Adjourned it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly I know no such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer</font> , I would ask you one 
Question; If
in case the Common Serjeant, or the Common Cryer, or any other       
Officers
do put a Question that the Commons would not have put, who 
orders them to put the right Question?
<pagebreak id="21" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say any thing to that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the Common Serjeant comes up and    
reports what
is done, then what doth my Lord Mayor do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My <font>Lord Mayor</font> and the             
<font>Aldermen</font> go down to the
<font>Hustings</font> , and it is declared by the Recorder, or the Common     
Serjeant,
by the order of my <font>Lord Mayor</font> . -- I think my <font>Lord Mayor</font>     
went once
down to give them some satisfaction upon a dispute.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Man</font> , during the Election   
did you ever hear
them Adjourn'd before it was over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, nor never heard any occasion 
for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Common Serjeant</font> affirms himself   
to be a <font>Servant</font> to
the <font>Commons</font> , and not to the <font>Lord Mayor</font> and <font>Aldermen</font> ;   
have you
known a Common Serjeant say, he was a Servant to the <font>Commons</font> , and
not to the <font>Lord Mayor</font> and <font>Aldermen</font> ?
    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never was in a Common Hall upon    
any such dispute,
I am with my Lord Mayor.
    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have known a Recorder           
reprehended by a very
learned Lawyer, for saying, <font>My Masters the Aldermen</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you who hath the management of 
the
Common Hall in the absence of the Mayor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sword-Bearer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am always here waiting upon my Lord 
Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if your Lordship please,  
we will rest here
as to point of Right: Now, my Lord in the next place we will come to
that which is a more immediate Question before you, and we will prove
the manner of it, and the persons that are guilty; for that is the   
next
step we are to go. -- Mr. <font>Bancroft</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, they have laid in the            
Information, That the
Sheriffs are duly Elected for one year next following, from the Eve of
St. <font>Michael</font> ; now prove your Election to be for that year you    
have laid
in your Information.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, they have certainly in Fact       
mistaken their
Information. My Lord, They do declare that the Common Hall was
held, according to Custom, For the Election of Sheriffs, to hold that
Office from the Eve of St. <font>Michael</font> , for the year next ensuing:  
Now,
my Lord, that is not so in Fact, nor never was, for the Election is  
for
a year to commence on <font>Michaelmas</font> Day. They take on the Eve the
Office upon them, but they do absolutely exercise the Office for a   
Year
from that time, from the Eve. Now, my Lord, we say, that Day is
excluded; we are sure it is a Common Case, it is known very well;
as in a Lease, the <font>Habendum</font> from any Date, the Day of the Date   
is no
part of that Lease, it is exclusive and no part of the Term, and     
therefore,
my Lord, if they do not prove it as they have laid it, we hope
they will be non-suited.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is another piece of Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Eve of <font>Michaelmas</font> Day, we make this   
Objection, and
put you to prove it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give us leave to go on: Gentlemen, 
let us prove
what we think fit, and if we have not made it out, then make your    
Exceptions.
<pagebreak id="22" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Serjeant, I think it is proper to put it  
now, for if there
be no such Election, there can be no such Riot; for they have made   
it a
Riot in a special manner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Holt</font> , under your favour,  
it is not a time for it
now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. General,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the oddest way these          
Gentlemen take upon
them so: I will not prove it; and pray be quiet till I come to my
time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Mr. Attorney, if we have an     
Objection to
make, if the Court pleases we may be heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly it was never known, that 
when Mr. Attorney
exhibited an Information, to tell us how to prove it. Surely,
Gentlemen, you will give us leave to go on with our Proof, won't
yee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Molloy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Bancroft</font> , How long have you been a 
Servant of the
City? By whose Order was the Hall summoned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Lord Mayor's.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">A BLANK SPACE FOLLOWS <font>Mr.</font> IN SOURCE TEXT.</comment>   
Who hath Dissolved them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">A BLANK SPACE FOLLOWS <font>Mr.</font> IN SOURCE TEXT.</comment>   
Did you ever know the Sheriffs give any Order for the
dissolving of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know it dissolved before the  
business was 
done for which they were call'd? Did my <font>Lord Mayor</font> in your time  
either
dissolve them, or send them going, till the Election was over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can say nothing to that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Bancroft</font> , I would ask you this, Sir, 
Did the Sheriffs
ever continue the Hall after my Lord Mayor had dissolved it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never knew that in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Fran. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Bancroft</font> , I would ask    
you a Question, I
don't ask you who calls them, or bids them go home, during the time
of the Election, did my Lord Mayor ever meddle?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor withdraws.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who are those among the Commons that  
manage
the business when my Lord Mayor withdraws?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriffs, and the Common Serjeant, and 
the <font>Common
Cryer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who manages the Election? Who         
declares the 
Election? Who declares who is chosen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Banc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Election is made below, then the     
Sheriffs come
up, and the <font>Common Serjeant</font> , and the <font>Common Cryer</font> along     
with them,
and acquaint my <font>Lord Mayor</font> , and he goes down, and there doth    
confirm
the Election, and withal, when the work is done he dissolves the
Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know a Poll for Sheriffs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you take the <font>Common Serjeant</font> to be  
an Officer of
the <font>Commons of London</font> , or an Officer of my Lord Mayor's?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot be certain what he is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If in case the Common Serjeant differ from 
them in declaring
the Poll, is it not usual for the Common Hall to order him to
put it up again?
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who does make a Judgment of        
Election, the
Common Serjeant, or the Sheriffs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriffs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do not the Common Serjeant make    
Observation
as well as the <font>Sheriffs</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Bancroft,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriffs give their Opinions in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, my Lord, if your Lordship     
please, if they
had done, we would desire to go on to our Fact, for otherwise for    
ought
I perceive, we shall be in here till this time to morrow, and they   
say, we
must not adjourn till the Cause is over. -- Mr. Common Cryer; heark
you, Mr. Common Cryer, Were you present at <font>Midsummer</font> Day when
this business happened? Give my Lord and the Jury an account of the
carriage then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was there at the beginning of the     
Election, I did make
Proclamation, afterwards there was a Poll demanded, and the Poll was
begun, and I went home with my Lord Mayor, afterwards my Lord
Mayor came back again, and there was a Hubburb; but about 5 or 6 a
Clock, my Lord Mayor came down upon the <font>Hustings</font> , and I adjourn'd
the Court till another day; I did Adjourn it by his order, according 
as I
used to do, and then I went away with my Lord Mayor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what usage had you in going out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Common Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went before my <font>Lord Mayor</font> , I   
was not with
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the Adjournment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the <font>Hustings</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Sheriffs Polling the People then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know that, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Sheriffs near the Hustings?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know, I saw them not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Election of them, when my   
<font>Lord Mayor</font>
came to Adjourn the Court; were the Sheriffs acquainted with it:
Where were the Sheriffs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Cryer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor sent to them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Weston</font> , Pray will you     
tell my Lord and the 
Jury, what Directions you had from my Lord Mayor, and how he was used
when he came out of the Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My <font>Lord Mayor</font> sent me, my Lord, to the  
Sheriffs under
the <font>Lumbard-house</font> twice to come up to the Council-Chamber, and   
they
told me: One told me, he was upon the King's Business; and the other
said, he could not come; and about half an hour after, my Lord, 
Sheriff <font>Pilkington</font> came up to my Lord Mayor into the             
Council-Chamber,
and then immediately came down to the Court of Hustings, and Mr.
Common Cryer by my Lord Mayor's order, did Adjourn the Court from
<font>Saturday</font> till <font>Tuesday</font> following, and as we were coming out   
of the Hall,
when Mr. Common Cryer had Adjourn'd the Court, and said, <font>God save
the King</font> , a great part of the Hall hiss'd; and but that there     
were so
many honest Gentlemen about my Lord, I was afraid my Lord would
have come to some mischief; but coming to go into the Porch-yard, I
saw his Hat off, and I went to catch his Hat, and caught one of his  
Officers
by the head, that was knocked down, or fell down, that held up
<pagebreak id="24" />
his Train. My Lord, the Sword was at that distance, farther then it
is between your Honour, and where I stand, and crouded far away, and 
when my Lord came out into the Yard; Gentlemen, says he, I desire
you would go home to your Lodgings, and commanded them in the
<font>King's Name</font> to depart: and says he to me, Pray go you back, and  
let
the Sheriffs know, and tell them I have Adjourn'd the Court to  
<font>Tuesday</font> . Upon my Lord's Command I went back to let the Sheriffs 
know
that my Lord had Adjourned the Court till <font>Tuesday</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serjeant Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Both of them, both <font>Shute</font>    
and <font>Pilkington</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, <font>Shute</font> , t'other was by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in his hearing, was it not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in his hearing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see my Lord Mayor down,    
and his
Hat off?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw his Hat off, Sir <font>George</font> , but I   
can't tell how it
came off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, you saw my Lord's Hat off, can   
you tell whether
my Lord was so courteous to take his Hat off or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare say, my Lord did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he, or no? I ask you upon your Oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell that, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't think that those Gentlemen were so     
extraordinary civil
to my Lord Mayor, that when the <font>Common Cryer</font> made Proclamation,
<font>God save the King</font> , that there should be hissing; those that     
hissed were
not extraordinary civil to my Lord Mayor, and I believe you don't    
think
so neither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you a Question, My Lord Mayor's Hat 
was off --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, and it must be supposed it was to          
Complement those fine
men that hiss'd at <font>God save the King</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if your Lordship pleases, 
I would desire to
know what account any of them can give of the opinion they had of the
King, to be sure they had a great opinion of his Representative: But 
my
Lord Mayor I find was so extraordinary civil, that to this Rabble he 
must
not only pull off his Hat, but fling his Hat on the ground to them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you whether you know that any of the 
Defendants
in this Information did throw my Lord Mayor's Hat off, or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is not a farthing matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>F. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a mighty Riot upon the Hat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I desired them to keep back; my Lord    
Mayor's
Friends did press back as much as they could to preserve my Lord     
Mayor;
they prest more forward, as the other kept back, and I desired them to
forbear; nay, commanded them in the <font>King's Name</font> , and upon their
Peril and took my Cane to strike at some of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He served them well enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did so. Do you think a Magistrate is to be  
crouded and
prest upon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Weston,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I struck at them, and said, Gentlemen, keep 
back, and
entreated them and commanded them, and all would not do.
<pagebreak id="25" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would only say this, <font>Mr. Com.  
Serjeant</font> ; What did
you hear when Proclamation was made to depart?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was not in the Hall when      
Proclamation was
made, but I heard them cry out, No <font>God bless the King</font> ; and I    
heard
them cry out, <font>Down with the Sword; No Lord Mayor, no King</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you name any Person that said this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I laid hold on one man that     
cryed, <font>No God
save the King; No Lord Mayor</font> ; and the Rabble got him from me, one
that I heard say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Common Serjeant, you say, you heard   
this; can
you name any person?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you I caught hold of him, and the 
Rabble got
him from me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you name any one?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Com. Serj.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you I cannot.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I hope that will not much 
prevail in this
place, but I hope it doth justifie my Lord Mayor, for endeavouring to
disperse the Rabble that came together to that height when the King  
was
<font>prayed for</font> , to cry out, <font>No King, No Lord Mayor</font> . And we     
don't give this
in Evidence against any one person, for it was done in a tumultuous 
manner; but they were so fond of this man, as that they rescued him  
from
him; and to fix it upon them, we will prove they were every one of
them concerned in the Riot. -- Mr. <font>Craddock</font> , What account can you
give of this matter?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was standing at the place where they    
Poll'd, and my
Lord Mayor was coming towards it to protest against the manner of    
proceeding;
and Sheriff <font>Bethel</font> came to me, and said, Resist him, (I think)
he hath nothing to do here.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was <font>Bethel</font> , <font>Slingsby   
Bethel</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was either, <font>oppose</font> , or <font>resist   
him</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He says, he thinks he said, <font>Resist      
him</font> ; but he is sure it
was either <font>Oppose</font> , or <font>Resist him</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see <font>Mr. Jenks</font> there?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say I did: I saw <font>Mr. Jenks</font>    
just as My Lord
Mayor came down, not after.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see <font>Mr. John Deagle</font>    
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see <font>Mr. Deagle</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did they use my Lord Mayor?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not very near my Lord; I stood at the
place where the Poll was taking.
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Craddock</font> , We desire to ask you    
this Question, that
you speak particularly to <font>Mr. Bethel</font> , Was it before my Lord     
Mayor had
Adjourn'd the Poll, or after?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was just as my Lord Mayor came to      
Protest against
the manner of Polling.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Poll adjourn'd before or after?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Bethel</font> , you say, he said,        
<font>Oppose</font> , or <font>Resist</font> ; did he
say it before the Poll was adjourn'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, it was before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you say what the words were?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Craddock,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was either <font>Oppose</font> , or <font>Resist,   
he hath no Authority
here</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which is <font>George Reeves</font> ? <font>Mr. 
Reeves</font> , Pray will 
you tell us what you did observe done at this time by <font>Mr.          
Pilkington</font> , or
<font>Mr. Shute</font> , or any person else?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Reeves,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came about 4 or 5 a Clock to the          
Polling-place where
the Coaches use to stand, and I saw the Sword up, I suppose my Lord
Mayor was there, and came to stop their Proceedings in Polling; and
there was a great Contest among them; some saying, he had nothing to
do there: He hath no more to do than I, says one; Another cryed,
Stop the Sword, stop the Sword; and I laid hold of him, and got him a
little way, and made account to have carried him to the Sheriffs,    
and the
Lord Mayor, but some body got him away.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you observe <font>Shute</font> and  
<font>Pilkington</font> do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Reeves,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They encouraged the People to Poll.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After my Lord Mayor was gone?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Reeves,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray you, Sir, did you observe either <font>Mr.  
Shute</font> , or <font>Mr.
Pilkington</font> encourage the People to Hollow or Shout, or those things?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Reeves,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heark you Friend <font>Reeves</font> , heark you; How   
do you know
that <font>Pilkington</font> or <font>Shute</font> were Polling? Are you sure they     
were Polling after
my Lord was gone?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Reeves,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were at the Polling-places, and they   
did not go
away a great while after that.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From the People that were about them?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Reeves,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We agree it in Fact it was so.
<pagebreak id="27" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Richard Fletcher</font> , Pray will you give 
the Court an account
of what they did.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Hill</font> , What did you       
observe there?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About 5 a Clock, my Lord Mayor came to the    
Hall, there
was with him then Sir <font>James Edwards</font> , and Sir <font>William          
Pritchard</font> , now
Lord Mayor, to the best of my memory; and he told them he disliked
their Polling any more: and there came a tall black man; says he,    
<font>Mr.</font>
Sheriff go on, it is your business, we will stand by you; about a    
quarter
of an Hour after my Lord came out of the Hall to the great Croud, some
of the People hissing, and some making a noise; and one came to the  
Sheriffs,
and says he, Gentleman, why do not you make Proclamation with
<font>O Yes</font> , and they continued there till towards 8 a Clock.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear no Officer Adjourn    
the Court?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Mayor went home, I saw him within     
doors, and
I came back again.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there no Proclamation made afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By some of the Officers, but I did not take   
particular notice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did you see here after you went home  
with my
Lord Mayor, and came back again?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw here Mr. <font>Robert Key</font> for one, and I  
saw <font>Mr. Goodenough</font>
come in between 8 and 9 here in the Hall, and my Lord <font>Gray</font>
came in, and several other Gentlemen.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they do when they came?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heark you, <font>Hill</font> , Was my Lord  
<font>Gray</font> and Mr. <font>Goodenough</font> ,
and Mr. <font>Key</font> , were they among the People?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the Sheriffs came up, they went into    
the <font>Orphan's</font>
Court, <font>Mr. Goodenough</font> came in and out, and my Lord <font>Gray</font> went 
in to
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they appear among the People   
up and down
in the Hall?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They went through the Hall to and fro.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Fran. Winnington,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Christian Name of    
that <font>Goodenough</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know him, he that was Under-Sheriff last    
year: I know
him well enough, and he knows me; yes, that is Mr. <font>Goodenough</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Gray,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to ask this Witness a Question, my  
Lord.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let your Counsel ask, my Lord.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know another Question; 
Did you see 
Mr. <font>Cornish</font> ?
<pagebreak id="28" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw Mr. Alderman <font>Cornish</font> walk in the    
Hall, but I can't tell
whether he went into the Room, or no. After my Lord was gone, he
did come up into the Mayor's Court, and came thorough among the      
People.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hill</font> , you speak of my Lord <font>Gray</font> ; 
upon your Oath
did you see my Lord <font>Gray</font> walk to and fro in the Hall, or only came
thorough?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Gray</font> came in at that Gate, and    
went thorough the
Hall, and went in to the Sheriffs.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would ask you this upon your Oath, Did  
you see him
do any thing more?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I was there to discharge my Office.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Gray,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I own my being there; but only      
desire to ask
a Question that will clear this matter.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw my Lord <font>Gray</font> come up those Stairs,  
and he went into
the <font>Orphan's Court</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long might that be after the   
Poll?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the Sheriffs came up I believe it might 
be half an Hour,
or a quarter of an Hour, near an Hour.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see my Lord <font>Gray</font> do any thing 
more than
walk?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him come to the <font>Orphan's Court</font> ,    
and they would not
open the Door at first; but they said, it is my Lord <font>Gray</font> , and  
then they
let him in.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your own Councel is asking my Lord; I am       
willing you
should ask a Question if your own Councel will let you. Gentlemen, my
Lord would ask a Question himself, and you won't let him.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Gray,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Though I do not know this Gentleman 
at all,
yet I will venture to ask him a Question: Pray Sir, did you see me   
speak
to any one man?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hill,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have answered that already, I say not.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Gray,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Books brought from the              
Polling-place by the
Sheriffs before I came, before that I went in there? -- My Lord, I
was there, and shall give you an account of it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It had been better, my Lord, if you had kept   
away.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Captain <font>Clark</font> , pray will you  
give an account of
what you observed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Capt. <font>Clark,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came down into the Hall, and did hear a   
whispering,
whereupon I went to guard my Lord Mayor, my Lord Mayor came down
upon the <font>Hustings</font> , and Proclamation was made for the            
adjournment of
the Court; whereupon when proclamation, <font>God save the King</font> , was  
made,
an hundred, <font>&amp;c.</font> I believe more, hist at that, I laid hold of one 
of them, <font>No
King's-man, no Sword's-man</font> , cryed they; <font>Sirrah, you are a       
Rascal and a Traytor
in your heart</font> , said I, and laid fast hold on him; but there was a 
very
great crowd, and sayes one or two, <font>For God's sake Captain</font> Clark, 
<font>do you
guard my Lord</font> ; There was Mr. <font>Weston</font> and Major <font>Kelsey</font> ; my 
Lord, said
they, is in danger; said I, <font>Gentlemen keep by him or go before, I  
will be in
your Rear-Guard</font> . My Lord Mayor was down upon his Knee, I can't tell
how he came down, <font>Press on, press on</font> , this was the Cry, and     
<font>God save the
Sheriffs</font> . After coming down the steps, I pressed as near as I     
could to my
Lord Mayor to keep them off; <font>Now</font> , said I, <font>this is the time to 
keep the
Rabble off, now face about</font> ; I had my Sword in my hand, and with the 
pommel of my Sword kept them off; <font>Before God</font> , said I, <font>I will  
keep you off</font> ; and
so I waited on my Lord home, and went and drank a glass of Sack. About
an hour or two hours afterwards I came down to the Hall and found the
People shouting, <font>God save the Sheriffs, God save the Sheriffs;     
What nothing</font> ,
said I, <font>of my Lord Mayor</font> ? <font>But</font> , said I, <font>this is not a     
place to quarrel in, let
us not quarrel together</font> . I saw the Sheriffs <font>Pilkington</font> and    
<font>Shute</font> were concerned
in carrying on the Poll, and this they continued to do for some time,
at last, <font>I am weary of the Hall</font> , said I, <font>I will go home</font> ;   
and this was between 8. and 9. a Clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you remember any body else      
besides the Sheriffs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Capt. <font>Clark.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, I cannot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you remember Sir. <font>Thomas      
Player</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cap. <font>Clark.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>No I can't</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Captain <font>Clark</font> , Did you know    
never a one of them
that cryed out so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Capt. <font>Clark.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I was before Sir <font>Robert      
Clayton</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Major <font>Kelsey</font> , pray will you    
give my Lord and the
Jury an Account of what you saw on <font>Midsummer</font> day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Major Kelsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, when my Lord came out of the     
Court I went
after, and some cryed <font>Stop him, stop him</font> ; but I got between     
them and some
of my Lord's Friends kept them off; but when we came just to the going
out, they gave a shout, and I saw my Lord Mayor's Hatt upon his Back,
<pagebreak id="28" />
<comment type="compiler">THIS IS THE SECOND PAGE NUMBERED 28 (HERE FOR 30) IN SOURCE TEXT</comment>
and I can't tell whether he touched the ground with his hand, but I  
was
e'en almost down; said I, <font>Gentlemen do you intend to murder my Lord
Mayor</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did you see there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Major Kelsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, Sir, I was almost down, and did   
not see their
Faces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Trice Hammon</font> , I would only 
ask you, Who did
you see, who did you observe to be there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About 9. a clock at Night, or something      
before, I stood
at the Door that leads to the <font>Common-Pleas</font> , and there
came in Alderman <font>Cornish</font> and <font>Good-enough</font> , and Old
<font>Key</font> , an old white-hair'd man, and by and by my 
Master Sheriff <font>Shute</font> came out and told me, <font>I shall give
you all Satisfaction by and by</font> ; <font>God bless you, Mr. Sheriff</font> ,  
said I; and he
went again, and there I staid till they came out, and then he went   
upon 
the <font>Hustings</font> , and I went along with him when he came out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who went with him out to go to the  
<font>Hustings</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>William Gulston</font> and several other    
men, there is never
a name in the Indictment more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None of them that are in the        
Indictment? name
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have named them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prethee name them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Alderman <font>Cornish</font> , both the          
Sheriffs, my Lord <font>Grey</font> ,
Mr. <font>Good-enough</font> , and old Mr. <font>Key</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which <font>Good-enough</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That <font>Mr. Good-enough</font> that stands there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is such a noise that I did    
not very well hear
that word.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Goodenough</font> , not that <font>Goodenough</font>     
that looks upon me, but
he that stands behind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He falls behind now, but he ran up  
and down then,
and Alderman <font>Cornish</font> was there too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You witness, you have named all these men,   
what did <font>Shute</font>
do, or what did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When he came upon the <font>Hustings</font> , he     
made proclamation
himself, because one or two refused it, he did it himself; and after 
a while
he adjourned the Court upon the <font>Hustings</font> ; this was on           
<font>Midsummer</font> day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As the Common Cryer usually sayes at such    
times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you saw Mr. <font>Goodenough</font> , and    
you saw my Lord
<font>Grey</font> , upon your Oath, can you say they did any thing, or was    
any thing
done in abuse to my Lord Mayor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did not tell me, my Lord, what they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you what did they do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mighty busie they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it after my Lord Mayor        
adjourned the
Court?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About two hours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So much the worse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must understand it was some time before    
Mr. Sheriff had
made his adjournment, they were busie till that time.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if your Lordship pleases,  
I do agree with
Mr. <font>Thomson</font> , that the Jury should remember that this was two    
hours after
my Lord Mayor had adjourned the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Gray.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire, my Lord, I may ask him some         
Questions. You say you
saw me go to the Council Chamber, at what time, and who went with me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little before Candle-light.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Gray.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say all the Company went out with the    
Sheriffs, and
went away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I did not say you came out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord was of the Upper House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and may be there again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Gray.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope I shall be there, Mr. <font>Attorney</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It had better you had been so then, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Gray.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It will be the worse for you, I shan't lie    
Perdue for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you threaten me, my Lord, I shall take  
notice of it.
My Lord, I have done you a kindness, but if you come under my hands
again, I shall not do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Justice,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They would not have it said, <font>God save  
the King</font> , and my
Lord you were with some of those that abused him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Gray.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After it was over, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were not within your duty here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Gray.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, it was after the Poll was closed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. S. <font>Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire if you please, what  
is usual in all causes,
that we might go on without any interruption. Let us go on for the
King, and then make all the defence you can. Don't think either to   
hiss
us or threaten us out of our cause. Mr. <font>Higgins</font> , give my Lord   
and the
Jury an account of what you saw or heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I attended with several of our     
Company by my
Lord Mayor's Coach to <font>Guild-hall</font> , and was in the                
Council Chamber, and he
sent for the Sheriff, after that he went away; and when <font>God save the
King</font> was said, said they, <font>God save the Protestant Sheriffs</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. S. <font>Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know Mr. <font>Higgins</font> this, 
what they said?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They cryed, <font>Down with the Sword</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Attorney</font> is making a Speech to us,  
I don't know what
he hath said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. S. <font>Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't think Mr. <font>Attorney</font> thinks  
you worth a Speech.
Mr. <font>Higgins</font> , I desire you to ask you a Question, I ask you this 
Question
upon your Oath, after the adjournment of the Court, and after this   
very insolent
behaviour of some of the Rabble that were there, for I can call them
no better, who did you see there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After I went home, I went to see my Lord    
safe home, and
came back again, I saw one <font>Freeman</font> that they call the            
<font>Protestant Cheesmonger</font> ,
calling, <font>To poll, to poll</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. S. <font>Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray who else did you see?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw Mr. Alderman <font>Cornish</font> come up      
towards the Sheriffs.
Gentlemen, said he, you are doing right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. S. <font>Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear Mr. Alderman <font>Cornish</font>  
say so? What this
Gentleman? Do you know him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Says he to Sheriff <font>Shute</font> , You shall    
have all right done to
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who else did you see there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw Mr. <font>Swinnock</font> .
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see Mr. <font>Key</font> , did you  
see Mr. <font>Pilkington</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see Mr. <font>Pilkington</font> , I saw   
<font>Shute</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see Mr. <font>Jekyl</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which of them do you mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Elder man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is <font>John Jekyl</font> the Elder, 
Gentlemen, and <font>John
Jekyl</font> the Younger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was disputing with a Fellow that his     
Toes came out of
his Shooes, and had a green Apron, said <font>I</font> , <font>Are you a Livery   
man</font> ? <font>Yes, I
am</font> , said he. <font>Surely</font> , said I, <font>they don't use to make such   
as you are Livery-men</font> .
Saies Mr. <font>Jekyl, He may be as good a man as you, for ought I       
know</font> .
That was about half an hour after my Lord Mayor went home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time was the Adjournment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About 5. or 6. I was speaking something,   
<font>You are all in a 
Riot</font> . <font>This is no Riot</font> , saies Mr. <font>Swinnock</font> to me; I can   
never meet you but
you are railing against the King's Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Kings Evidence, what was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was done by Mr. <font>Jekyl</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was talking among the People.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did encourage among the rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are in a Passion now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, I am not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He seconded Mr. <font>Cornish</font> when he said,  
<font>Insist upon your
Rights</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Freeman</font> , my Lord, that they call the  
<font>Protestant Cheesemonger</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very pretty word indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay so it is, he is so called, you  
will give us leave to
hear what the Witnesses speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Another Epithet would do a great deal      
better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>William Bell</font> , what was done   
upon the spot, was
there any hurt?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you say, upon your Oath, that Gentleman 
was
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Higgins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have seen him in the Balcony.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He saies he uses to be there upon  
publick daies in
the Coffee-house. -- <font>Bell</font> , I would desire to know of you,       
whether you are
able to give an account after my Lord Mayor's Adjournment, who was
there; name as many persons as you can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Bethel</font> , and I saw Mr. <font>Cornish</font> go  
through the little Gate
into the Yard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is all, Sir. Sheriff <font>Pilkington</font>       
delivered two Poll-Books
into my hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Vavasor</font> , will you tell my Lord   
and the Jury what you saw?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Vavasor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It happened thus, Mr. <font>Hammond</font> had taken 
a man upon
Execution, who was Bail for a Client of mine who had paid the moneys
long before; upon that I came to know who imployed him, and coming
here, I found Mr. <font>Hammond</font> in that place, and the crowd was so    
great
<pagebreak id="31" />
<font>Don't go back again</font> , said he, <font>for you will go near to be      
abused</font> . Whilst I staid
there, I asked him what was the meaning; Saies he, <font>In this Room    
are the
Sheriffs and some others casting up the Poll</font> ; and whilst I staid, 
there came
in Mr. <font>Good-enough</font> to and fro from them, and before they would   
admit
any, they would know their names; there was Mr. <font>Key</font> , my Lord    
<font>Gray</font> , and
Sir <font>William Gulston</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Vavasor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Mr. <font>Cornish</font> was there, he and      
Sheriff <font>Shute</font> came
out together, and they went upon those Stairs under the Clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who came out with Sheriff <font>Shute</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Vavasor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Cornish.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Cornish</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Vavasor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alderman <font>Cornish</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very mannerly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His name was <font>Cornish</font> before he 
was Alderman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Vavasor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And Sheriff <font>Shute</font> told the People,     
<font>If they would stay a little
time, he would give them Satisfaction</font> . Upon that, Mr. <font>Cornish</font> 
went
through the Company, and when they came to the <font>Hustings</font> , Mr.    
<font>Shute</font>
ordered Proclamation to be made, and told them, <font>Whereas my Lord    
Mayor
had taken upon him to adjourn at 9. a Clock, We the Sheriffs of</font>    
London <font>and</font>
Middlesex, <font>being the proper Officers, do adjourn it to</font> Tuesday   
<font>at 9 of the
Clock</font> . Upon that an Antient Gentleman desired they might proclaim 
the
Election. Then saies <font>Shute</font> , that <font>I can't do it now, for we    
have taken very good
Counsel for what we do</font> . Had it not been for Mr. <font>Hammond</font> , I   
had been, I
believe, trod under foot sufficiently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Denham</font> , who did you see?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw Sir <font>Thomas Player</font> and Mr.         
<font>Jenks</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did you see them pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Yard. I went home with my Lord       
Mayor, and then
I saw them. I had a kind of a glance, but I can't swear positively   
to Mr.
<font>Jekyl</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Thomas Player</font> and Mr.      
<font>Jenks</font> , what did you see
them do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heark you, Friend, where was it you  
saw them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Yard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you see them do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many People might be there     
then? two or
three hundred?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Above a Thousand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you hear Sir <font>Thomas Player</font>   
say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was he from his own Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On t'other side the Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A mighty way indeed, a mighty thing. What 
said Mr.
<font>Jenks</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denham.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say, Sir, that I heard him speak a  
word, only in the
Tumult.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fr. Winnington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Friend, I ask you this, I think I    
heard you say you
saw Sir <font>Thomas Player</font> and Mr. <font>Jenks</font> in the Yard; but you did 
not see them
do any thing at all?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Thomas Player</font> you say in the first     
place?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and <font>Wickham</font> , my Lord, a       
Scrivener in <font>Loathbury</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sheriff <font>Pilkington</font> and <font>Shute</font> ,  
and Mr. <font>Cornish</font> , Alderman
<font>Cornish</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see one <font>Deagle</font> there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Wickham</font> you saw there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Sir, I know him very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Thomson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is <font>Wickham's</font> Christian Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Wickham</font> , he goes by that 
name, it may be he
was not Christ'ned. Was <font>Jenks</font> there, do you know him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Linnen-Draper?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, very well, he goes by the name 
of <font>Francis Jenks</font> .
Did you see <font>Jekyl</font> there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know the name, I saw a great    
many I knew by
sight, but not their names.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Holt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did these Gentlemen do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le tell you, Sir, there was Sheriff   
<font>Pilkington</font> and Sheriff
<font>Shute</font> , I went in where they were taking the Poll; said I,       
<font>Gentlemen, my
Lord Mayor hath adjourned the Court, what do you do here? I suppose  
it lies
in my Lord Mayor's power; if it lies in him to call, certainly he    
must dissolve</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You argued thus?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray give us leave to go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was Mr. <font>Wickham</font> , and saies   
he, <font>My Lord Mayor
hath nothing to do here, neither will we be ruled by any of your     
Tory Lord
Mayors. This is not the first aspersion</font> , said I, <font>that you have  
cast upon a Gentleman
that loves the Church and the Government established by Law</font> ; and
they fell about me, and had it not been for Mr. <font>Fletcher</font> and Mr. 
<font>Hill</font> , I 
believe they had done me a mischief; for they trod upon my Toes; who
did it I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you say Sir <font>Thomas Player</font>  
and <font>Pilkington</font> and
Alderman <font>Cornish</font> were amongst them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Farrington.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's enough. -- Pray Mr.         
<font>Cartwright</font> , will you
tell my Lord and the Jury what you observed there, and who was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cartwright.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know the names of no persons that were 
there, all
that I can say was this. As soon as my Lord Mayor adjourned the Court
upon the <font>Hustings</font> , he came down, and going out of the Hall, he  
had like
to have been thrown down, had it not been for Mr. <font>Shaw</font> ; and     
going to
save my Lord Mayor, I wrenched my back, and I spit blood for seven   
daies
after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell that Mr. <font>Cartwright</font> over   
again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cartwright.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My back was wrenched in saving my Lord   
Mayor,
and I spit Blood 7 days after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Endeavouring to save my Lord Mayor  
his back
was so wrenched that he spit blood 6 or 7 days after. Heark you Mr. 
<pagebreak id="33" />
<font>Cartwright</font> ever since that time, have you found any indisposition?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cartwright.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have not been my own man since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He took a Surfeit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He took a Surfeit of ill Company I  
am sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Shaw</font> , give my Lord and the Jury   
an account of what
you know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shaw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, my Lord Mayor sent to the Sheriffs,   
and ordered
them to forbear Polling and come up to the Chamber, and sent 2 or 3
times; but they denied coming to him, and went on and ordered the    
Common
Cryer to make Proclamation for them to depart; and if they stayed
that he would look upon them as Rioters; and there was hissing and a
great deal of crowd, and there was Sir <font>James Edwards</font> in the      
Court, they
hunched him with their Elbows, and as his Lordship came down going
down the Steps there was such a croud, that if I had not catched his
Lordship in my arms he had fallen upon his forehead, and his hat was
off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did you see so misbehave themselves?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shaw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think we have now proved it       
against every body
we design, save only against Mr. <font>Deagle</font> , for we do not now      
proceed
against <font>Dorman Newman</font> and <font>Benjamin Alsop</font> . Now, my Lord, we  
will only
prove against <font>John Deagle</font> , and then we shall have done. Mr.     
<font>Kemp</font> will
you tell my Lord and the Jury who you saw here. Did you observe any
particulars after the Court was adjourned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Kemp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember I observed any one man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You don't? Had you any discourse    
with Mr. <font>Deagle</font>
at any time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Kemp,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he tell you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Kemp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did confess he was there about 7 a clock at 
Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did own he was among them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Kemp.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, with Alderman <font>Cornish</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you, Mr. <font>Rigby</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Rigby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him about 7 aclock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he in the crowd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Rigby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, amongst the People.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is all now, Gentlemen, but     
<font>Dorman Newman</font> ,
and <font>Benjamin Alsop</font> , and we don't go against them now. After     
they had
done this, and hist at the King, and cried, <font>No King, no Lord       
Mayor</font> , what
acclamations went these People off with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammond.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Court was broke up by the          
Sheriffs, they cryed,
<font>God save our true Protestant Sheriffs</font> , and in that manner they  
followed us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hammond.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They hollowed us home, Sir, as far as       
fishmonger's
Hall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They began with a hiss, and ended   
with a hollow.
