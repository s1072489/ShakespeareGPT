 <head> <font>THE EXAMINATION OF</font> THOMAS KNOX, <font>LATELY SERVANT TO THE       
LORD</font> DUMBLANE,
<font>BEFORE US SIR</font> WILLIAM WALLER, <font>AND</font> EDMUND WARCUP, <font>ESQUIRE,  
TWO OF HIS
MAJESTY'S JUSTICES OF THE PEACE FOR THE COUNTY OF</font> MIDDLESEX, <font>AND 
CITY AND
LIBERTIES OF</font> VVESTMINSTER, <font>TAKEN BY US BY VERTUE OF AN ORDER OF  
THE</font>
COMMITTEE <font>OF</font> LORDS.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Examinant saith, That on the <font>1st</font> of <font>April</font> ,        
walking in the painted Chamber,
<font>W. Osborne</font> came to him and told him, that he being informed that 
he had lived in
the E. of <font>Danby's</font> Family for some time, he had something of      
moment to
communicate to him, which might be a means to save the Lord Treasurer,
<pagebreak id="14" />
whereupon this Examinant walked with the said <font>Osborne</font> into the   
<font>Abby</font> ; being in the
<font>Abby</font> , <font>Osborne</font> delivered Papers drawn up by way of           
Information, being five in
number, none of them bearing any date, and one Paper of several      
Memorials of
<font>John Lane</font> , and <font>William Osborne</font> : The next day they brought  
him to the <font>Cloysters</font>
in <font>Westminster-Abby</font> , several meetings they had afterwards, and  
four Letters they
wrote to him: About the fifth of <font>April</font> they went together to Mr. 
<font>Cheyney</font> at
<font>Chelsey</font> , one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace; but he     
told them, the business
being of an high nature, and matter of State, he desired to be       
excused: About
a fortnight after, this Examinant went to Mr. <font>Dewe</font> , upon the    
same Errand, and
received the like Answer as Mr. <font>Cheyney</font> had done; not long after 
he went likewise
to Mr. Secretary <font>Coventrey</font> , who told him, that he being a       
Member of the House
of Commons, by whom the said Lord Treasurer had been Impeached, he   
could not
meddle in that business: None of the forementioned Gentlemen, his    
Majesties
Justices of the Peace, had a sight of any of the Papers, but only    
upon the
Information (which this Examinant made in his own Name) they, and    
Mr. Secretary
<font>Coventrey</font> , made the same Answer.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinant being something scrupulous in medling in the     
business, they
told him, that they had been with Captain <font>Thuar</font> formerly, and    
had acquainted
him with this business; and that he had advised them, it being a     
nice business, to
let it alone, till the heat of the Parliament should be a little     
over: About a 
fortnight after that, <font>Will. Osborne</font> , and <font>John Lane</font> had      
communicated these matters to
the Examinant, they complaining that they knew not where             
conveniently to
lodge, this Examinant told them he would endeavour to find them      
Lodgings;
and the very same day, by the direction of the Lord <font>Dunblain's</font>   
Coach-man, went
to the <font>Sugar-Loaf</font> in <font>Pickadilly</font> , and took Lodgings on his   
own account, for
himself, and two of his Friends, and lay there with them. At the     
time of their going
from the said Lodgings, which was four or five days at most, the     
said <font>Osborne</font> and
<font>Lane</font> paid to this Examinant two Shillings a-piece; and during    
the time that this
Examinant was with them, they constantly paid their Club. This       
Examinant
further saith, that he hath communicated this business to the Lord   
<font>Latimere</font> , and
that he had given the Papers before-mentioned into his hands to be   
perused,
which he hath now delivered into our Custody: He likewise declares   
neither to
have seen or heard of any body coming to them from the Lords in the  
<font>Tower</font> , or
knoweth of their ever having been at the <font>Tower</font> . And further,    
this Examinant
saith, that he never directly or indirectly did supply the said      
<font>Osborne</font> or <font>Lane</font> with
any money, or made them any promise of Reward whatsoever; only he
confesseth, that at the <font>Tun-Tavern</font> in S. <font>Martin's</font> Lane, he   
flung down a Guinney on the
Table, the said <font>Lane</font> saying he had no money, and promising to    
repay it; and
further this Examinant saith not.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Memorand.</font> That after the aforesaid Examination, he         
confessed to us both, that
he had written a Note this Afternoon (being a Prisoner) to Mr.       
<font>Osborne</font> , to inform
him, <font>that he would be examined this afternoon</font> , (with these      
other words) <font>We always
Clubbed, and you paid two Shillings at the</font> Sugar-Loaf: <font>Tear      
this</font> . He likewise
confessed that he had lain in <font>White-Fryers</font> , being again         
examined, although before
he had denied it.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <font>THE EXAMINATION OF</font> JOHN LANE, <font>SON OF</font> RICHARD LANE, <font>AT   
THIS TIME ONE OF THE
YEOMEN OF THE GUARD IN EXTRAORDINARY TO HIS MAJESTY, TAKEN IN        
OBEDIENCE TO AN
ORDER OF THE LORDS OF THE COMMITTEE, FOR EXAMINING DISCOVERIES       
RELATING TO
<pagebreak id="15" />
THE LATE HORRID CONSPIRACY, BEFORE US SIR</font> WILLIAM WALLER, <font>AND</font>  
EDMOND
WARCUPP, <font>ESQ; TWO OF HIS MAJESTIES JUSTICES OF THE PEACE</font> , THIS  
29. APRIL. 1679.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Examinant saith, that he lived with Mr. <font>Oates</font> nine     
Weeks; about the
seventh of <font>April</font> last he quitted <font>Mr. Oates</font> his service;      
whilst he lived with the said
Mr. <font>Oates</font> , he saith, he daily sent his Servants to Morning      
Prayers, reserving one
only with him, to dress him: This Examinant saith, that whilst he    
was his
Servant, he was never charged by Mr. <font>Oates</font> of opening any of his 
Letters, or of any
other misdemeanour: He further saith, that three Informations marked 
the
numbers (1) (2) (4) and the Memorial marked number (6) were written  
by Mr.
<font>William Osborne</font> , and were by this Examinant subscribed, none    
saving the said
<font>Osborne</font> being present; and three of the Letters marked (2) (3)   
and (4) were
written by the said <font>William Osborne</font> , and were by this           
Examinants own hand
subscribed, <font>John Lane</font> , none else being present, and thinks that 
they were truly dated
when written. This Examinant confesseth, that he, and Mr. <font>Knox</font> , 
and Mr.
<font>Osborne</font> , lay privately this day fortnight in <font>White-Fryers</font> , 
from the <font>Tuesday</font> to the
<font>Saturday</font> following; and from thence they went and lodged in a    
paved Alley, 
leading out of <font>Chancery-Lane</font> into <font>Lincoln-Inn-fields</font> , and   
there they rested all the next
day, which was <font>Easter-day</font> , and the Night: On <font>Monday</font> they    
removed into
<font>Pickadilly</font> , to the Sign of the three <font>Sugar-Loaves</font> , and     
there continued till <font>Friday</font> last,
at which time he was taken. These three forementioned Lodgings were  
taken by
Mr. <font>Knox</font> ; and this Examinant, and Mr. <font>Osborne</font> , deliver'd   
their share of Charges
from time to time, both for Diet and Lodging, to the said Mr.        
<font>Knox</font> ; and then the
said Mr. <font>Knox</font> paid all the expences to the persons to whom it    
was due, but not in
their presence.
   This Examinat saith, that he, <font>Mr. Knox</font> , and <font>Mr.            
Osborne</font> , once being at the
<font>One-Tun-Tavern</font> in <font>St. Martins-Lane</font> , <font>Mr. Knox</font> threw a    
Guinney on the Table,
which this Examinant saith he took up, and put it into his Pocket,   
<font>Mr. Knox</font> then
saying, that</nonSpeech><dialogue> it <font>should never be said I gave you any money</font> .    
</dialogue><nonSpeech>And he further saith, that
never at any time, either <font>Mr. Knox</font> , or any other person,        
directly or indirectly, gave
him either any money, or promised him any Reward whatsoever, for     
thus accusing
<font>Mr. Oates</font> ; neither was he by <font>Mr. Knox</font> , or any other        
person, ever perswaded to
swear for the Lords in the <font>Tower</font> , or the Lord Treasurer, and    
further this 
Examination saith not.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <font>A FURTHER EXAMINATION OF</font> JOHN LANE, <font>SON TO</font> RICHARD LANE,  
<font>AT THIS TIME ONE OF
THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD TO HIS MAJESTY, TAKEN BY ME AT THE EARNEST   
SUITE AND
REQUEST OF THE SAID</font> JOHN LANE, <font>THIS   OF   1679</font> .</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Examinant having been this day brought to the door of the  
Commitee of
Lords, in order to a further Examination of what he had formerly     
deposed, being
<pagebreak id="16" />
brought back to the Prison without having appeared before the Lords; 
the 
Committee having, by reason of the King's being come to the House,   
adjourn'd the
hearing of this Examinant until <font>Fryday</font> morning; this Examinant   
being touched and
pricked in his own Conscience with a real and hearty remorse and     
sorrow for the
great Guilt he had contracted, in falsely swearing and accusing Mr.  
<font>Oates</font> and Mr.
<font>Bedlow</font> , desired one Mr. <font>Ricks</font> , one of the Yeomen of the    
Guard, to endeavour to
find out Sir <font>Will. Waller</font> , to beg his pardon, and let him know  
that he was now
fully convinced of his sin, and should confess the whole <font>naked     
truth</font> , though he
should expose his own Reputation to ruine, rather than encrease his  
Guilt by
justifying of what in his own Conscience he is convinced to be false.
   This Examinant declareth, that the first time he ever met Mr.     
<font>Thomas Knox</font> , it
was at the Sign of the <font>Hole in the Wall in Duffins Alley</font> in      
<font>Kings-street</font> , and that
there Mr. <font>Knox</font> advised him what he should say concerning Mr.     
<font>Oates</font> , in
Reference to any discourse either of the King, Queen, or Lord        
Treasurer; that at this
Examinant's <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Examinatnt's</comment> coming to that House, he   
was not to ask for Mr. <font>Knox</font> , but for the 
Number (3) After some discourse there how they should contrive an    
accusation of
Mr. <font>Oates</font> , The said <font>Knox</font> gave this Examinant directions how 
to do it; and it
being late they broke up their meeting: This first meeting happened  
to be on the 
<font>Tuesday</font> , or <font>Wednedsay</font> , before he left Mr. <font>Oates</font> : The  
second meeting was agreed to be
at the <font>Owle</font> in <font>King-street</font> , on the <font>Sunday</font> following, at 
three of the Clock in the
Afternoon, and whoever should come first, should ask for the Figure  
of (3) at the
Bar, but Mr. <font>Knox</font> , having some other extraordinary business     
they made no stay,
or came to any Resolution; but appointed a third meeting, which to   
the best of
this Examinant's memory was at the <font>Kings-Armes</font> in the            
<font>Bowling-Alley</font> : but the
said Mr. <font>Knox</font> not coming at the appointed time, the Examinant,   
and <font>Osborn</font>
walked in the Cloysters, and had not been there long but Mr.         
<font>Knox</font> came to
them, whereupon, immediately they took Coach, and went directly to   
<font>Chelsea</font> ,
to Mr. <font>Cheyney</font> , where they were to swear some things against    
Mr. <font>Oates</font> , according
to <font>Mr. Knox's</font> Instructions, in behalf of the Lord Treasurer:     
This Examinant, and
the said <font>Osborn</font> stayed in the Coach, whilest <font>Knox</font> (as he     
told this Examinant, and
<font>Osborn</font> ) went to speak with <font>Mr. Cheyney</font> , who stayed not     
very long; and at his
return told them that <font>Mr. Cheyney</font> refused to meddle in the       
business, whereupon
they return'd to <font>White Hall</font> . This Examinant being yet in <font>Mr.  
Oates</font> his service:
The <font>Monday</font> following this Examinant came away from <font>Mr.         
Oates</font> , and either on
that very day, or the day following, had another meeting with        
<font>Knox</font> , and <font>Osborne</font>
at the <font>One-Tun Tavern</font> in St. <font>Martins-Lane</font> , by the sign all  
of the Number (3)
where <font>Knox</font> treated this Examinant with Oysters, and Wine; and    
after they had
eaten their Oysters, <font>Mr. Knox</font> , and <font>Osborne</font> , wrote out the  
Informations, <font>Knox</font>
being the <font>Dictator</font> of them; and at the same time the said        
<font>Knox</font> made this
Examinant, and the said <font>Osborne</font> swear secresie: what this        
Examinant's part was to swear,
<font>Knox</font> prevail'd with <font>Osborne</font> to write down, because the       
Examinant could not write
a good hand. The writings being finisht, <font>Knox</font> took them and put  
them in his
pocket, and paid the reckoning, offering them before hand, if they   
would either eat, or
drink, they might call for whatever they had a mind to; and told     
them, because
it should not be said, he had given them money, he would contrive in 
a short time to
convey some to them, and appointed the same place to meet at the     
next day by two
of the clock, and according to the agreement, they all met at the    
said place; where
after they had drank a Pint of Sack, he dropped a Guinney on the     
Table, and told
them, that on the next day they should have another; and after they  
had been by him
enjoined secresie, they parted: The next day <font>Osborne</font> (as this    
Exeminant was told
by him) he met the said <font>Knox</font> and received a Guinney according to 
<font>Knox</font> his
promise the day before; the same day as <font>Osborne</font> had received the 
Guinney of <font>Knox</font> ,
in the Evening <font>Osborne</font> came to the Examinant's Lodgings in       
<font>Westminster</font> , and
then told this Examinant of the Guinney he had received, and         
return'd him ten
shillings, which the day before this Examinant had lent him: A day   
or two after
<pagebreak id="17" />
they had another meeting at the <font>Green Dragon</font> in the              
<font>Pel-mel</font> , and there
dined, after Dinner, Mr. <font>Osborn</font> was desired by <font>Knox</font> to write 
a letter,
according to such a manner as he would direct, and caused him to     
date the
Letter of a latter date, and direct the said Letter to him, which    
being done
he put up the Letter in his Pocket; and having clubbed in the        
payment of the
Reckoning which came to twelve pence a piece, parted for that time, 
appointing a meeting the same night to be at the <font>Rose Tavern</font> in  
the <font>Pel-mel</font> , to
be at nine of the clock,</nonSpeech><dialogue> where accordingly we met, and supped      
together, and
conferred with <font>Knox</font> , asking how things went? to which he        
answered <font>very 
well</font> ! about ten of the clock at night we parted, and came to      
<font>Westminster</font> , and
agreed the next day to meet in a little Alley near the               
<font>Rose-Tavern</font> in the
<font>Pell-mel</font> , at an <font>Ordinary</font> , about seven or eight in the      
evening, where we met
and had a Supper, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and at this House <font>Knox</font> took the first        
lodging for this
Examinant and the said <font>Osborne</font> , and lay there the same night.   
The next
morning after they had broke their fast, Mr. <font>Knox</font> came to this   
Examinant and
<font>Osborne</font> , and told them that he had provided them another        
lodging at the
<font>Cider-house</font> in <font>Leicester-fields</font> at the sign of the           
<font>Apple-tree</font> , and at the said
Cider-house, this Examinant and <font>Osborne</font> continued from           
<font>Tuesday</font> or
<font>Wednesday</font> to <font>Saturday</font> , during which time <font>Knox</font> caused    
<font>Osborne</font> to write him a 
Letter, as he should direct him, which he did, and gave it to        
<font>Knox</font> , who
continually advised both <font>Osborne</font> and <font>Knox</font> , to seem to press 
him earnestly to
engage in this business; on the Saturday this <font>Examinant</font> and      
<font>Osborne</font> ,
changed their lodgings which were provided for them by <font>Knox</font> , in 
a little <font>paved
Alley</font> leading out of little <font>Lincolnes-Inn fields</font> into          
<font>Chancery-lane</font> , and there the
said <font>Knox</font> lay with this <font>Examinant</font> and <font>Osborne</font> , in one   
and the same bed:
The next morning <font>Knox</font> with this <font>Examinant</font> and <font>Osborne</font>    
(their lodgings
being paid for by <font>Knox</font> ) went together into <font>Whitefriers</font> ,    
and <font>Knox</font> took 
lodgings next door to a Musick house, where they all three lodged    
for near
a week, after which time, Mr. <font>Knox</font> having (as he told this       
Examinant)
pay'd the Reckoning; This <font>Examinant, and Osborne, and Knox</font> ,     
removed
to their forementioned lodgings in the Paved Alley leading out of    
<font>little
Lincolns Inn fields</font> into <font>Chancery lane</font> , and lay there         
<font>Easter-eve</font> till
<font>Easter-monday</font> , whence the said <font>Knox</font> , and <font>Osborne</font> ,     
with this <font>Examinant</font> removed into
<font>Pickadilly</font> to the signe of the <font>three Sugar-loaves</font> a Grocers  
house, and there this
Examinant continued lodged with the said <font>Knox, and Osborne</font> ,     
until last
Fryday at which time this Examinant was seized at his Fathers house  
at the
sign of the <font>Wooll-pack</font> in <font>Westminster</font> : This Examinant       
farther saith, that
all charges for diet and lodging in the said respective places were  
paid, and
cleared by Mr. <font>Knox</font> , unless at the <font>Green-Dragon</font> in the      
<font>Pell-mell</font> , and the
<font>Owle</font> in <font>King-street</font> , where this <font>Examinant</font> and the said  
<font>Osborne</font> paid their
Clubs, which to the best of this Examinants memory did not exceed
eighteen pence a piece. This <font>Examinant</font> doth further say that by  
way of
encouragement the said <font>Knox</font> told Mr. <font>Osborne</font> , in his        
hearing, that for what
he should say in behalf of the <font>Lord Treasurer</font> he should be sure  
of a
considerable reward both of Money, and preferment. And the said      
<font>Knox</font> did
likewise tell this <font>Examinant</font> for his encouragement that he       
should want neither
money nor a good place as long as he should live: And least any of   
these
proceedings should be discovered, either by <font>William Osborne</font>      
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Osbrone</font> </comment> , or this
<font>Examinant</font> , the said <font>Knox</font> , told them, that if either of     
them should make a
discovery of him, he would be sure to dispatch them by one meanes or 
other,
and if he should discover them <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: then</comment> he would freely 
grant them the same liberty.
This Examinant likewise saith, that <font>Knox</font> assured him, he should  
not doubt
<pagebreak id="18" />
but that the <font>Lords in the Tower</font> would likewise own his kindness  
to them
in Accusing Mr. <font>Oates</font> and Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> : And further this      
<font>Examinant</font> saith not,
onely humbly begs pardon from God, and of their Lordships for the    
heinous
Crime he stands guilty of,</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>This <font>Examinant having</font> recollected himself further saith,    
that the very day
the <font>Lord Treasurer</font> came into the <font>Black Rod</font> , Mr. <font>Knox</font>    
made this <font>Examinant</font> ,
and <font>William Osborn</font> swear they would stand to what he had         
instructed them to
write, and said, that if they should not the <font>Lord Treasurer</font>      
would die; and
that he would not have come in but for them; hoping they would       
swear, as
they had been by the said <font>Knox</font> directed: This <font>Examinant</font>      
further saith, that
on <font>Monday</font> last, the Nurse belonging to the Goal, came to him,    
and told him,
he should do well to stick to Mr. <font>Knox</font> ; and that a Gentlewoman  
very well
habited came to the Prison, and bid her tell this <font>Examinant</font> ,    
that he should be
sure to stick to Mr. <font>Knox</font> , and not be daunted, and what monies  
soever he
should require, tho it were a thousand pounds, he should have it: 
Whereupon this <font>Examinant</font> asked the Nurse, who this Gentlewoman   
was, to whom she
replyed, she would not discover her name, because she would not have 
her
name brought in question, and further this <font>Examinant</font> saith not.</nonSpeech>

COUNTY OF</font> DEVON,
<font>VINTENER TAKEN UPON OATH IN OBEDIENCE TO AN ORDER OF THE</font> LORDS   
COMMITTEES,
<font>FOR EXAMINING OF DISCOVERIES, RELATING TO THE LATE HORRID

<pagebreak id="19" />
WILLIAM WALLER <font>BARONET, AND</font> EDWARD WARCUP, <font>ESQ; TWO OF HIS     
MAJESTIES
JUSTICES OF THE PEACE, THIS</font> 29TH <font>DAY OF APRIL</font> , 1679.</head> 

 <head> <font>MIDDLESEX AND WESTMINSTER.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Examinant saith, that he served Mr. <font>Titus Oates</font> from   
the tenth of
<font>December</font> last, to the latter end of <font>March</font> past; That the     
said Mr. <font>Oates</font> paid
this <font>Examinant</font> his Wages very honestly, and his usage was civil, 
but he
sometimes corrected this Examinant for Misdemeanors, at which this   
Examinant
was offended, but never intended any mischief to Mr. <font>Oates</font> for   
it: And this
Examinant farther saith, that Mr. <font>Oates</font> was a passionate man,    
yet very
Religious, and every morning sent all his Servants to the Kings      
Chappel to prayers,
only ordering some one of them to stay at home to dress him; and he  
further
saith, that he never heard Mr. <font>Oates</font> say, he had any design to   
accuse the <font>Lord
Treasurer</font> , or any ways to destroy him; nor did this Examinant     
ever hear any
discourse between Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> , and Mr. <font>Oates</font> tending to any  
Accusation
against the <font>Lord Treasurer</font> ; but this Examinant did see the      
Information that Mr.
<font>Bedlow</font> gave against the Lord Treasurer, which Mr. <font>Wiggins</font> ,  
Mr. <font>Bedlows</font> Clerk,
shewed to this <font>Examinant</font> , after the same was sworn publickly.   
And this
Examinant further saith, that he never heard Mr. <font>Oates</font> say that  
he had any
accusation to make against the <font>Queen</font> , or had made any: and the  
worst word he ever
heard him speak of the <font>Queen</font> was,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Where is our Dame</font> going? 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>which was
when he saw the Guard drawn out in the Yard to attend her Majesty.   
And
this Examinant further saith, that one day at Dinner, when Mr.       
<font>Wharton</font> , Mr.
<font>Oates his Father</font> , Dr. <font>Jones</font> and others were present, some   
discourse happen'd
between them about Sir <font>John Robinson</font> , and sometime after the    
naming of him, 
Mr. <font>Oates</font> did say these words:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>We have not gone to bed sober 
these four years</font> :
</dialogue><nonSpeech>which  Mr. <font>Thurston</font> , Mr. <font>Lane</font> , and this <font>Examinant</font>    
did think to be <font>spoken of the
King</font> , but this Examinant cannot say 'twas spoken of His Majesty,  
in regard
he can give no reason why to apply it so. And he further saith, that 
he
cannot remember, or call to mind, that he ever heard Mr. <font>Oates</font>   
speak any undecent
words of any passages between His Majesty and Mr. <font>Cheffinch</font> ;    
and this
<font>Examinant</font> further saith, that he hath layen several nights with  
Mr. <font>Oates</font> , but never
found he afford the least lascivious or undecent action to this      
<font>Examinant</font> , but did
exhort this <font>Examinant</font> from time to time to lead a good course of 
Life, free from
doing evil, and often made this <font>Examinant</font> to read Sermons, and   
other Books
by him: And this <font>Examinant</font> further saith, That upon the first of 
<font>April</font> last,
Mr. <font>John Lane</font> (now Prisoner with this Examinant in the           
<font>Gatehouse</font> , and 
formerly fellow servant with this <font>Examinant</font> to Mr. <font>Oates</font> )   
brought this
Examinant to Mr. <font>Knox</font> in the <font>painted Chamber</font> , who thence    
went to the Cloysters
in the Abbey with this Examinant, where he discoursed about the      
<font>Earl of
Danby</font> , and Mr. <font>Knox</font> proposed then to this <font>Examinant</font> ,     
<font>That if this Examinant
would swear, That Mr.</font> Bedlow <font>came to Mr.</font> Oates <font>his Chamber,  
and there said,
that he had been with the</font> Earl of Danby, <font>and that the</font> Earl of  
Danby <font>had
promised him money to go beyond Sea, and that this was a contrived   
story, between
the said Mr.</font> Oates, <font>and Mr.</font> Bedlow, <font>to take away the Earl of 
Danby's Life</font> ,
that in such case, this Examinant should have enough to maintain this
Examinant and a Footboy to attend him. And this Examinant saith,     
that he
met Mr. <font>Knox</font> in the same Cloysters afterwards twice, they two    
being alone,
when he alwayes continued his discourse, and promises of what great  
rewards
this <font>Examinant</font> should have if he would swear that Mr.            
<font>Bedlow</font> , and Mr. <font>Oates</font> ,
in this Examinants hearing contrived the design against the Lord     
Treasurer,
<pagebreak id="20" />
whereby to prove; that the said Mr. <font>Oates</font> , and Mr. <font>Bedlow</font>   
in this Examinants
hearing should say,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Come let us contrive a story to ruine the    
Lord Treasurer</font> , 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and that Mr. <font>Bedlow</font> should within a day or two after come to   
Mr. <font>Oates</font> and
say,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>now I have found out a way to do the Rogues business for    
him: I will swear
he hath offer'd me money to go beyond Sea</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>and that Mr.         
<font>Oates</font> should reply,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you
could never have thought of a better way</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>And this              
<font>Examinant</font> was to swear,
that all these things were spoken in this Examinants hearing: And upon
these Conditions Mr. <font>Knox</font> promis'd this <font>Examinant</font> sufficient 
reward. And
this Examinant saith, that Mr. <font>Lane</font> was not to swear to these    
things, (as Mr.
<font>Knox</font> told this Examinant.) And this <font>Examinant</font> further saith, 
that He, Mr.
<font>Lane</font> , and Mr. <font>Knox</font> , met several times together, and when   
Mr. <font>Knox</font> had
any thing to say to this <font>Examinent</font> , he took him aside in the    
Room; and when
he had any thing to say to Mr. <font>Lane</font> , he took him aside also,    
and so discoursed
them severally: But about this <font>Tuesday</font> was a <font>fortnight</font> , Mr. 
<font>Knox</font> took a
lodging for this Examinant, Mr. <font>Lane</font> , and himself, in <font>White   
Friers</font> at the <font>three
Flower de Luces</font> , where they lodged, till the <font>Saturday</font> night   
following, and in
that time Mr. <font>Knox</font> dictated to this Examinant, what should be this
<font>Examinants</font> , and <font>John Lanes</font> Depositions, and they were       
written once before
at the <font>one Tun Tavern</font> in St. <font>Martins Lane</font> : And he saith,    
that what Mr. <font>Lanes</font>
part in his Deposition about the <font>Queen</font> , was to be, was not      
spoken of till the
the lodging in <font>White Friers</font> , though the other part of the       
Depositions, were
dictated by Mr. <font>Knox</font> before: And he further saith, that the      
<font>four Letters</font> , 
now shewed this Examinant marked (1) (2) (3) (4) are all of this
Examinants hand Writing, but were directed by Mr. <font>Knox</font> , what    
they should
contain, and were antedated several days before they were written    
(by Mr.
<font>Knox</font> his direction) because it should appear thereby, that this  
<font>Examinant</font> ,
and Mr. <font>Lane</font> invited the said Mr. <font>Knox</font> to take their         
Depositions, and to
bring them to light as a matter of Conscience, not of his, Mr.       
<font>Knox</font> , his
own seeking; and this <font>Examinant</font> further saith, that the          
<font>Informations</font>
marked (1.) (2.) (3.) (4.) (5.) and the <font>Memorials</font> marked (6.)    
are all of
this Examinants hand Writing, and were all dictated                  
<font> <foreign>verbatim</foreign> </font> to this
Examinant , to be the <font>Informations upon Oath</font> of this             
<font>Examinant</font> , and the said Mr.
<font>Lane</font> : And this <font>Examinant</font> saith, that Mr. <font>Knox</font> took this 
<font>Examinant</font> , and
Mr. <font>Lane</font> in a Coach with him out of Town, with an intent to have 
them
sworn before Mr. <font>Cheyney</font> at <font>Chelsea</font> , where this             
<font>Examinant</font> , and Mr. <font>Lane</font>
continoed in the Coach, while Mr. <font>Knox</font> went out, and at his      
return Mr.
<font>Knox</font> told us, that Mr. <font>Cheyney</font> would not take the            
Informations, but advised
they should be taken before <font>one of the Privy Counsellors</font> , who   
should be one
of the <font>Lord Treasurers friends</font> : And this Examinant saith, that  
afterwards
they removed their Lodgings into an Alley leading into <font>little 
Lincolns-Inn-fields</font> out of <font>Chancery Lane</font> , where they staid on 
<font>Sunday</font> was a seven night last;
and on <font>Monday</font> following they removed to <font>Pickadilly</font> , to the  
<font>three Sugar Loaves</font> , in
all which time, and places Mr, <font>Knox</font> heartned up this Examinant   
and Mr. <font>Lane</font>
to stand to the Depositions aforesaid: promissing great rewards, and 
bearing
all their expences, affording what meat or wine was desired, and     
some Treats he
bestowed, which amounted to near twenty shillings a time at          
<font>Taverns</font> . And this
Examinant saith, that Mr. <font>Lane</font> being taken, Mr. <font>Knox</font> sent a  
Hackney-Coach to
this Examinants Lodging, at the said <font>three Sugar Loaves</font> in       
<font>Pickadilly</font> , with
the <font>Lord Dumblaines</font> Coachman, and this Examinant went into the   
Coach
and took up Mr. <font>Knox</font> at the <font>Mews</font> , and then this Examinant was
carried into <font>White Friers</font> , to another Lodging, where Mr.        
<font>Knox</font> Lodged with
this Examinant one night, being <font>Friday</font> night last, and then he   
said that the
<pagebreak id="21" />
taking of Mr. <font>Lane</font> would be for the better, because they should  
sooner come
to an end; and he heartened up this <font>Examinant</font> , and said, that   
if this
Examinant should be taken also, a thousand pounds Bail would be      
given for this
<font>Examinants</font> Liberty. And he further saith that <font>Mr. Knox</font> gave  
this <font>Examinant</font>
one Guinney at one time, by throwing it on the table, that this      
<font>Examinant</font>
might take it up; but it was so orderd that it should not be given   
this
Examinant, that he might safely swear no money was given him; and at 
the last
lodging in <font>Whitefriers</font> <font>Mr. Knox</font> came, and lay down on a bed  
by the
<font>Examinant</font> , and then laid his Arm over this <font>Examinant</font> , and  
let fall ten shillings, which
this Examinant took up also: And <font>Mr. Lane</font> told this              
<font>Examinant</font> that <font>Mr. 
Knox</font> had given him one Guinny, in the same manner, by throwing it  
on a 
Table. And he further saith, that Mr. <font>Knox</font> told this Examinant,  
that he saw
Mr. <font>Lane</font> taken, and walked by Mr. <font>Wiggins</font> in a Troopers      
Cloak at the
same time. And this day this Examinant being in a Room in the
<font>Gatehouse</font> , a Note was brought to this Examinant, it being       
thrust under the door,
wherein was written these words, or to the effect following: <font>You   
will be
examined this afternoon; we always clubbed, and you paid two         
shillings at the 
Sugar-Loaf</font> : Tear this! but no name to it, which this Examinant    
knows to be of
Mr. <font>Knox</font> his hand Writing; and further at present saith not.</nonSpeech>
