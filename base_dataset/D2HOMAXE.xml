 <head>A NEW INSTRVCTION
OF PLOWING AND SETTING
OF CORNE, HANDLED IN
MANNER OF A DIALOGUE BETWEENE A
<font>PLOUGHMAN AND A SCHOLLER</font> .</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
   Seeing I am appoynted to defend
the profitable arte of setting of
Corne, though in respect of
learning very vnfit, yet because I haue
professed and practized
Husbandrie for the most part of thirtie
yeeres, and that you, the author of
the booke (called <font>God speede the
Plough</font> say that husbandrie is no part of your profession,
I may hope to maintaine against you by way of
argument in plaine Husbandrie, that Plowing and Setting is
much better and more profitable, than either Plowing
and Sowing, or Digging and Setting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I maruell that my booke doth so much
offend you, I thought to haue pleased you all
Ploughmen, for so commending the olde fashion of Plowing
and Sowing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely sir you haue no otherwise
offended me, than all other men that desire the good of their
Countrie, and be sorie to see the simple abused and
discouraged by your meanes, and how you please an other
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
sort of wilfull men, that will neither know what may be
profitable for themselues, nor haue any such heartie loue
to their Countrie and poore neighbours, as they ought
to haue. As for your booke, howsoeuer you meant, it
serues to so little good purpose (in my conceite) that it
was the chiefe cause that moued me to take this worke in
hand, to correct (if it were possible) the euill humors and
preiudicate opinions against Corne-Setting, that it hath
planted in mens heads and hearts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sorie that my booke should breede any
euill humors in mens heads or hearts, and I pray you
what faults doe you finde in my booke?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir there be faults too many, which being
the fruites of your idle houres (as you say) be not much
to be marueiled at, for seldome doth idlenes bring forth
any profite in husbandrie. And it is not my purpose to
expostulate with you vpon all particular faults; they are
too many to trouble the reader with: but you shall heare
mine opinion, like a man of my plaine profession, &amp; I will
tell you my minde what I doe thinke in this argument, as
well as I can. To passe ouer other matters, I will begin to
defend our old fashion of Ploughes, against your strange
Plough, that you say <font>might be so made and handled, that it
may goe deeper by a foote more than ordinarie, proportioning the
strength of the Teeme and Plough together</font> . Sir, if you can
deuise a Plough that will goe deeper in all grounds (for
you make no difference) a foote more than ordinarie, it
were good you brought it forth; for surely it is likely to
proue an implement of great force to our English
Husbandrie: for with it you must be compelled to plowe
land twentie inches deepe or thereabouts, and yet I must
confesse to my remembrance, I neuer saw any Plough,
though drawne with ten oxen, to goe aboue eight or ten
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
inches ordinarilie, and that with much a doe; and I pray
you, how many Oxen or Horse will your Plough require
to be drawne with? for in some places if you make it goe,
we plaine countrie men will suspect you will Coniure:
and in many places the qualitie of the mould will not
permit our ten inches, much lesse your two and twentie.
Againe, what vse I pray you shall the Common-wealth
haue of such an implement, where either it cannot goe
vnles the diuell draw it, or may not goe for the euill
mould it will turne vp? and so your Plough in that
place doth more harme, than your booke can doe good
any where else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so sir, I will haue my Teeme and my
Plough so made, that it shall goe well of that depth in
such grounds, as I will chuse to set my Corne in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be possible (if it please God to
worke such wonders by your inuention) but we the
poorer sort of Husbandmen, cannot make Ploughs, and
prouide Teemes of that value and qualitie; neither haue
we such change of Land, as to make choyse of apt
grounds to beare the weight of such Plowes &amp; Teemes;
but I doubt not by Gods helpe, to plowe and dresse ten
Acres of Land, as well as you shall doe with your strange
Plough, or any man shal do with a spade, except he digge
it two spit deepe, &amp; so burie the first spit with the second,
which wil be both extreme chargeable and impossible in
most grounds; and yet where he may digge but one spit,
there will remaine needes vnburied specially the Cooch,
which I neuer saw destroyed, but with a sommer fallow,
or burning the land, as the Deuonshire men doe: the
which killing of weedes, howsoeuer it can be done, is the
chiefe cause, that vpon extreame barren Land, those
countrie people haue good Corne, which otherwise
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
should haue little or none: and I desire all good
Husbands to consider how necessarie it is for them to destroy
the weedes, before they sowe or set their Corne, that (if
possiblie they can) they suffer not the weeds to sucke out
the sappe of their grounds in the spring time, and all
sommer, before they commit their seede to the ground,
indangering it with such enemies, which they may doe (in
my opinion) by one or two plowings more in their
sommer fallow aboue ordinarie, if the weedie condition of
the Land, or the season of the yeere doe require it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well sir, admit you doe plowe your Land as
well as the Spade can doe it, as deepe as your Plough
will goe, yet as I say, you cannot plowe it deepe enough,
nor lay it leuell and plaine for the setters to worke vpon.

<pagebreak id="B3V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so sir, these are not altogether so idle as
you make them, but I pray you how will you make this
barren Land rich enough, to haue such increase as will
answere the charge of setting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeede that is not altogether so idle as
the other, but yet very easie to be answered, and very
likelie to be compassed, euen in the barrenest Countries
and places farre remoued from all meanes to enrich their
Land. Here then I would aduise all good Husband-men
that intend setting, to lay all their soile and foule doung
that they vsed to scatter ouer thirty Acres or there abouts,
(being their ordinarie season) I say, lay it vpon ten Acres.
And by reason they leaue twentie Acres to rest, they shall
keepe more store of Sheepe either of their own, or take to
folde of other mens, and so keep them better, and by that
meanes their folde will be much bigger, and their Land
will be folded much better: and if there be any Marle
of Chalke, or of other sort of good molde neere to be
had by any meanes, they shall now haue leasure to fetch
it, by reason they haue so little tillage to doe: or else doe
this, follow the example of a Gentleman that made a
great quantitie of soile, by the fodering of all his Cattell
vpon a peece of exceeding ranke ground about an Acre,
which being very good and restie Land neere his house,
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
he plowed vp in the end of Aprill, when his Cattell
went to grasse, and with two or three plowings so mixed
the restie ranke ground with the doung and fodder of
his cattell, that he had ten loade for one of very good
soile, (to the fatting of other grounds) then otherwise
he should haue had; and also there is much dounge to be
made with Ferne in places where it is neere: many good
Husbands do prouide great store in summer, that in
winter will serue for cattell to sit drie vpon, and make great
store of soile, with little cost, hauing now so much leisure
in this small Tillage. By these and diuers other good
meanes very common and easie, when men haue little
plowing, they may so inrich their land, that they shall not
neede to doubt of a better increase (by Gods helpe)
sufficient to pay the charge of setting liberally, with
threefold increase at Haruest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you may fall into another
inconuenience, that I warned you of in my booke, that is, to make
your land too ranke, and then your Corne will ledge,
and euery stalke will be slender and long, euery eare will
be heauier and longer than ordinarie, and so the Corne
will fall downe and ledge, and come to little good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This inconuenience will easilie be
helped. Wee had first neede to helpe our barren land, and
make it hartie, and then for falling and ledging I will set
it thin enough, as the qualitie of the ground requireth:
for it is the thicke sowing of ranke land vpon euill tillage
that causeth Corne to ledge. If the land be rich and the
yeere wet, the Corne ranke, and the weedes many; then
(as you say) it is like to ledge: few poore men in England
complaine their land is too rich, or desire their Corne
more thin, for then their purses would be more emptie. I
could easilie teach them such tricks as well as you with all
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
your cunning: and as for the length and slendernes of
the straw, I doubt not but it will be fit to beare the heauie
eares, which God send me, and take you the light if you
like them better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your reasons may proue good for sowing,
but for setting, you will be set a ground presentlie. For
where will you get people enow to set a Season fit for
a Teeme to be kept on? All the labourers in the
Countrie will scant serue you, and fiue or sixe such as you
would be.
<comment type="compiler">PLOUGHMAN'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="C1V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must needes confesse, that your experience
<pagebreak id="C2R" />
hath taught you to say more in this matter than I
conceiued of it before. But yet seeing you looke for no more
increase than sixe or eight quarters vpon an Acre, it is
not the admirable arte the first booke speakes of (which
made me mislike and write as I did) for many men in
diuers places haue had the like increase; neither doe I yet
perceiue how the charges of setting will be answered,
nor any matter worthie so great account as you make
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ploughman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What you see I know not, or what the
cause should be I cannot tell, that so many men should be
so blinde or so vnwilling to see how to doe themselues
and their neighbours so much good: but I feare me it is
the iust punishment of God vpon vs the sinfull people of
this good Land, that we hauing so great plentie of all
good things, do consume with gluttonie and with
drunkennesse so great blessings of God alreadie bestowed
vpon vs: and if we should by this meanes or any other,
expect a greater aboundance than yet we haue receiued, it
is to be feared that the Lord that seeth how wickedlie we
would consume it, will not permit such an vnthankfull
people to receiue so exceeding great a benefit, but euen
by our owne frowardnes will quite ouerthrow it. But yet
let vs see if we can possiblie be brought to discerne any
thing worthie account in this noueltie, as you tearme it:
And for example, say that thirtie Acres by Rodde, will
require three bushels of seede <font>Winchester</font> measure to
euerie Acre, (for so you say it will) and so in most land it
doth, which is eleuen quarters and two bushels of seede
to thirtie Acres: What is the vsuall increase vpon an
Acre in the common fields barren land?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scholler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The increase of an Acre of such barren land,
commonly is not aboue two quarters one yeere with
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
another, and one Acre with another, and when they so doe,
there neede be no dearth in England; for where one hath
aboue, three hath not so much: and therefore you will
hardlie approue that your setting will be to any great
purpose in those common fields, barren Land.
