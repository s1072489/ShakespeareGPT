AND EXPENSE.</comment>
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>The 
Knight asking his Lady for his pie, she told him with much 
adoe she had preuailed, but with no little paines in seeking 
Quinces, for she was faine to buy them ready preserued, &amp; 
to make a vertue of necessity that way. Sir <font>William</font> seeing  
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
it was so, said it should bee as well eaten, and sent for his 
Friends, Gentlemen, and others of no small account. 
There was other great cheare prouided to furnish vp 
this sumptuous Feast, and as he inuited them, hee tolde 
them it was a Quince Pie, which he would haue eaten: 
the day drew on, and the Gentiles were come, and all 
was in a redinesse, and still <font>Iack</font> forgat not the Pie, but 
stood faintly sicke, and refused his meate: the Knight sory 
that his best dish fayled him, made no small account of his 
well fare, askt him:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Iack</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes hee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Where lyes thy paine? 
In my mouth </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes hee (meaning indeede his mouth hung 
for the Quince Pie) a Barber was sent for from a Market 
towne hard by, who searcht his mouth and could finde no 
cause of paine: but sir <font>William</font> thinking the Foole wanted 
wit to tell his griefe (though not wit to play the theefe) bad 
the Barber depart, asking <font>Iack</font> what hee would eate? He 
sayd</nonSpeech><dialogue> nothing: </dialogue><nonSpeech>What he would drinke? He said</nonSpeech><dialogue> nothing: 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>which made sir <font>William</font> doubt much of his health, refusing 
his liquour, when it was vsually his practise, and the Knight 
ioyed in it too: askt him if he would lie downe? still 
answering no; but would stand by the Kitchin fire. The Knight, 
that knew he neuer came there but he did some exployte, 
forgetting that, led him by the hand (so much he made of 
him) and bad the Cooke see he wanted nothing. <font>Iack</font> 
standing still, groand &amp; sayd: If he dyed, he would forgiue all 
the world but the Cooke.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hang Foole </dialogue><nonSpeech> (sayes the Cooke) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
care not for thee, die to morrow if thou wilt, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so 
followed his busines. They knockt to the Dresser, and the dinner
went vp: <font>Iack</font> had a sheepes eye in the Ouen: anone the 
second course came, the Pie was drawne, set by, &amp; among 
other backt meates was to be sent vp, but wanting Suger, 
stept aside to the spicerie to fetch it, &amp; <font>Iack</font> in the meane 
time catcheth the Pie and claps it vnder his coate, and so 
runs through the Hall into the Yard, where was a broad 
Moate, and as he ran, the hot Pie burned his belly:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes 
<font>Iack</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> are yee so hot Sir <font>Willies</font> Pie. Ile quence ye anone  
sir 
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
<font>Willies</font> Pie </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes he, and straight very subtilly leapes 
into the Moate vp to the arme pits, and there stood eating 
the Pie. The Cooke comes in, misses the Pie, withal misses 
<font>Iack</font> , cryes out, the Pie: sir <font>Williams</font> Pie was gone, the 
Author of that feast was gone, and they all were vndone: 
a hurly burly went through the house, and one comes and 
whispers the Lady with the newes: she tels sir <font>William</font>
how <font>Iack Oates</font> had stolen the Pie. <font>Iack</font> was searcht for, 
and anon found in the Moate. It was told the Knight 
where the Foole was eating it:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> we 
are disfurnished of our feast, for <font>Iack</font> my Foole is in my 
Moate vp to the arme-pits eating of the Pie. </dialogue><nonSpeech>They laught 
and ran to the windows to see the iest: there they might see 
<font>Iack</font> eate, the Cooke call, the people hallow, but to no 
purpose: <font>Iack</font> fed &amp; feeding greedily (more to anger the Cooke,
then disapoint sir <font>William</font> ) euer as hee burnt his mouth 
with hast, dipt the Pie in the water to coole it:</nonSpeech><dialogue> O </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes the
Cooke</nonSpeech><dialogue> it is Sir <font>Williams</font> owne Pie sirra: O </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes <font>Iack</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
hang thee and Sir <font>Willy</font> too I care not, it is mine now: saue 
Sir <font>William</font> some </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes one,</nonSpeech><dialogue> saue my Lady some </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes 
another:</nonSpeech><dialogue> by <font>Iames</font> not a bit </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes <font>Iack</font> , and eate vp     
all, to
the wonder of the beholders, who neuer knew him eate so 
much before, but drincke ten times more: at length out 
comes <font>Iack</font> dropping dry, and goes to get fire to dry him: the 
Knight and the rest all laught a good at the iest, not 
knowing how to amend it. Sir <font>William</font> sends for the Cooke, who 
came vp with a sorrowfull hart, and lamentably 
complayning, said it was the Knights fault for placing him in the
Kitchin, where he neuer was but hee did like villany. The 
Knight not satisfied with the Cookes answere, presently 
discharges him of his seruice, and sent him to liue else where:</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
goe </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> trusse vp your trinkets and be gone, </dialogue><nonSpeech>the Cooke
seeing no remedy departed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Iack</font> being dry vp he comes, and knowing he had 
offended, tels a iest (for it was his manner so to doe) how a yong 
man brake his codpeece point, and let all bee seene that God  
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
sent him, or such fooleries, but that was not enough, and to 
chide him was to make of things worse then twas, and to 
no purpose neither. Sir <font>William</font> demaunded why hee eate 
the Pye:</nonSpeech><dialogue> because I had a stomacke </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes <font>Iack</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> would 
nought else serue </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes the Knight</nonSpeech><dialogue> but my Pye? No <font>Willy</font> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes he</nonSpeech><dialogue> thou would not be angry then, and the Cooke had 
not beene turnd away: but all is well thou art rich inough 
to buy more. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Knight perceiuing the fooles enuie, sent 
for the Cooke, and did let him enioy his place againe.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />

not Fooles naturall yet most artificiall, they carde hence

the knight is meant maintainers of Foolery: by the Hall, 
the Inne where the cards of vanity causeth many to be 
bewitcht as appeares in the seruing men, who busie in others 
braules are as easily made friends as they were set 
together by the eares. By the second is meant reach at Stars, 
ayming at honour, lighting somtime on the eare of 
memory, but ill taken because badly ment, is rewarded with a
deserued whipping. By the third is cald to question most 
that musically fret their time out in idle baubling, and 
will become artificiall Fooles to outbraue Fooles indeede,

the footeman had time to worke his will, and mingling a 
conceit with butter (which I will not name, least some one 
should practise the like) clapt it vnder the saddle, and as they

<nonSpeech>On a time appointed the King dined at Windsor in the 
Chappell yard, at Cardinall <font>Wolseys</font> , at the same time 
when he was building that admirable worke of his tombe,
at whose gate stood a number of poore people to be serued of 
almes when dinner was done within, and as <font>Will</font> past by

answer me in one thing: To whom dost thou owe thy soule? 
To God </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth hee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom thy wealth? To the poore,

thy word, and lend it mee: thou knowest I am poore, &amp; haue

   Now Lady world </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes <font>Sotto</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> you wonder at this first 
iest, do not tis common, for who so simple that being gordgd 
with broth themselues, will not giue their friends on 
spoonfull, especially our kinne. O weele to make them great make
our selues, &amp; pollitikly rise againe by their greatnes. But 
hee was simple in that, for though he raised many, himselfe 
stood at one stay. But the deed is not common therefore may 
fitly be termed a fooles deed, since the wise meddle not with 
it, vnlesse to plunge further in and winde from pouertie. 
But leaue it the greatest power of all to remedie and 
reuenge, while earthly Maiestie growes great by adding 
liberty to their afflictions, as in our commons of late, God 
preserue him for it. By the second morrally, signification 
giues this, that fooles questions reach to mirth, leading 
wisdome by the hand as age leads children by one finger, and 
though it houlds not fast in wisedome, yet it points at it. 
Better so then the wise to put questions to fooles, for thats
to put the mony out of the bag, &amp; leaue the mony behinde to 
bad vse, while themselues beg with the bag. Such like <font>Will 
Sommers</font> sleepe mongst dogs. The third bids vs charitably 
learne of simplicitie to pay our debts, when the poore 
creditor cals for it, but tis a generall fault, and such who haue
doores shut whereat the poore stand, shal find gates fast wher
themselues may not enter, but especially we of the laity, for
