</dialogue> <head>THE 
DEPOSITIONS 
OF THE 
DUKES WITNESSES 
THAT WERE EXAMINED.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Rowland Owen</font> saith,
that Mr. <font>Reymer</font>
about Six Years
since, being the Duke of
<font>Norfolks</font> Butler, ordered
him to carry the things
out, the Lodgings being
open, he saw Mr. <font>Germain</font>
in Bed with the Dutchess
of <font>Norfolk</font> ; the Dutchess
leapt out of the Bed, and
put on a Morning Gown,
and <font>German</font> hid himself in
<pagebreak id="A4RC2" />
Bed, this was between five
and six of the Clock in the
Evening, about a fortnight
before <font>Bartholomew-Day</font> ;
he did not tell the Duke,
he is sure it was <font>Germaine</font> ,
he saw him often, twice
or thrice a day, the
outward door of the
Lodgings were shut, but he
opened it with a Key he 
had.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="A4VC1" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Margaret Ellwood</font>
saith, she had a 
Company to see
the Lodgings at <font>Windsor</font> ,
in the first Year of King
<font>James</font> , about three or four
of the Clock in the
Afternoon, a Woman told her
my Lady was not there,
but she opening the door,
she saw Lady upon the
Stools in an ill Posture,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Mr. <font>Germaine's</font> Breeches 
were down, he pulled them
up, and laid his hand on
his Sword, saying, God
Damn you for a Whore,
how have you the
Impudence to come here? my
Lady bid him kick me
down, he scattered some
concerns, that is, Mans
Nature on the Boards. </dialogue><nonSpeech>She
saw no Nakedness but her
Knee, or a little above;
another time after, she
found <font>Germaine's</font>
Handkerchief and Ruffles in my
Ladies Bed; my Ladies
Women said, there was
<pagebreak id="A4VC2" />
<font>Germain's</font> Name upon
them. Another time she
saw Mr. <font>Cornwall</font> let Mr.
<font>Germaine</font> out of my Ladies
Closet; She saw <font>Germains</font>
Leggs within hers when
she came the first time
into the Room, and his
Breeches were about his 
heels: The first time was
in <font>Bartholomew-Fair</font> time,
Mrs. <font>Knifton</font> told her, it
was <font>Germains</font> Linnen.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>THOMAS <font>Hudson</font>
saith, That the
Duke of <font>Norfolk</font>
being at <font>Portsmouth</font> , he
was Butler at <font>Windsor</font> ,
when <font>Germaine</font> , the
Dutchess, and <font>Cornwall</font> went
to Play, <font>Germaine</font> sent his
Footman for clean Linnen,
which he brought next
Morning. Mrs. <font>Gwyn</font> said
to the Dutchess,</nonSpeech><dialogue> the Dogg
would have layn with me,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>but she would not lye with
the Dogg where the Deer
lay'd, for she knew my
<pagebreak id="B1RC1" />
Lady Dutchess would
accept of him; after that,
he saw a Shirt and
Wastecoat in the Closet, which
my Ladies Woman, and
<font>Ann Burton</font> took away.
My Lord being absent,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
we murmured amongst
our Selves, that my Lord
was wrong'd, I told my
Lord, whereupon my
Master <font>Cragg</font> had me to Lord
<font>Peterborough's</font> Lodgings,
and threatned me, that
he would prefer me to his 
Brother <font>Richards</font> , who
turned me off in <font>Germany</font> ;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>this was he thinks in
<font>December</font> or <font>September</font> , 1685
Mrs. <font>Gwyn</font> spoke this in
the Green-Room, and he
was in a Closet hard by,
and the Door open, and
so heard it.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>ANN <font>Burton</font> saith,
She was Servant
to the Duke and
Dutchess of <font>Norfolk</font> , when
the Duke was gone to
<pagebreak id="B1RC2" />
<font>Portsmouth</font> , she was at
<font>Windsor</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> and my Lady
went to <font>London</font> with
<font>Germaine</font> , when my Lady
came home, after Supper,
she was in great haste to
go to Bed, when she was
Undrest, she said she would
Lock us out, because she
would not be disturbed
before Eleven a Clock the
next Morning, though the
King or Queen should
come: <font>Hudson</font> told her,
<font>Germaine</font> was still in the
House, whereupon we laid
Chairs on the Back-stairs,
that we might hear him
if he came down; the
Chairs were not removed 
next Morning, when
<font>Germains</font> Man came with the
Linnen, he said, his Master 
was there. My Lady
ordered a Fire to be made in
my Lords Room, where,
when she was come, Mrs.
<font>Nelly Gwynn</font> came in, and
asked her, how she liked
her Nights rest, and being
<pagebreak id="B1VC1" />
asked for <font>Germaine</font> , she
said, she knew nothing of
him. My Lady
complaining of her Hair being out 
of Order, <font>Nelly</font> answered,
it was a hot Night with
her, enough to put her
Hair out of Powder and
Curl too: Presently after
<font>Cornwalle</font> came in and ask'd
for <font>Germaine</font> , and my Lady
saying, she knew nothing
of him, <font>Nelly Gwynn</font> said,
I question not but he will
come out by and by like
a drowned Ratt; with that
whilst I was cleaning the
Dining Room, Mrs. <font>Kifton</font>
called me, and shewed me
in the Closet, <font>Germaines</font>
Shirt and Wastcoat; and
afterwards, making my
Ladies Bed, saw there were
two Prints had laid, the
Shirt and Wastcoat were 
sent by the Duke to the
Lord <font>Peterboroug</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>she saith
she is a single Woman, and
was never Marryed, this
was about
<pagebreak id="B1VC2" />
<font>Bartholomew-Tide</font> about six Years since,
she supposes the Bed was
stained both by a Man and
Woman.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Simon Varelst</font> saith,
that he was at
<font>Windsor</font> to draw the
Dutchess of <font>Norfolks</font> Picture
about six Years since, and
had the Dukes Closet to
put his Pictures in; when
he had done, and had been
at home two or three days,
<font>German</font> came to him much
concerned, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you
can do the Dutchess an
extraordinary kindness, &amp;
will oblige the Lord and 
Lady <font>Peterborough</font> in the
highest degree; then he
shewed me a Letter from
the Dutchess to me, and
read it to me, before that
he told me there was a 
Shirt and Waiscoat, and
they are known to be his.
He said, I desire you to
save the Dutchess Honour,
I desire that you will be so
<pagebreak id="B2RC1" />
much a Gentleman, as to
own them to be yours,
and that you left them
there. I answered, I was
much concerned there
should be such a trouble,
but I desired to be excused,
I could not do it without
prejudice. He told me,
the Lord and Lady
<font>Peterborough</font> had discoursed the
Duke of <font>Norfolk</font> upon it,
and if it were but my 
Linnen, their discourse had
wrought so much on him,
that if there came but any
Evidence to assist them,
he would leave off the
Pursuit: I refusing still,
he offered me a Purse of
Gold, and told me, I should
have my Fortune by it,
but I still refusing Mr.
<font>Germaine</font> , he went away
very much discontented,
my own Wife being in
the next Room, over-heard
the discourse between
<font>Germaine</font> and me, and told
it, and spoke of it, else I
<pagebreak id="B2RC2" />
had not been here now.

  </dialogue><nonSpeech>THOMAS <font>Foster</font>
saith, that he was
Coachman to
Mr. <font>Germaine</font> , and carried
the Dutchess of <font>Norfolk</font>
often, about two Years
since in his Coach, and
brought her home, and the
Footmen have had four
Half-Crowns given them,
and <font>Martin</font> a <font>Dutchman</font>
his helper, called it
Hush-Money. It was by Night
against a Light, that he
saw her Face in the Coach,
it was about Seven or
Eight of the Clock at
Night, about this Time a
Year he hath seen her Face
once in the Day-time, she
looking out of a 
Sash-Window two Stories high in
<font>Germain's</font> House in 
<font>Park-Street</font> , he knows her Face
well enough; he hath
seen her before, and since
she was Married.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="B2VC1" />
<nonSpeech> <font>Edieth Sawbridge</font>
saith, that the
<font>Tuesday</font> following, this
unhappy Discourse
concerning the Dutchess of
<font>Norfolk</font> , Mrs. <font>Sturton</font> came
into her Chamber, and
she telling her what had
happened at <font>Windsor</font> ,
Mrs. <font>Sturton</font> replied, this
was nothing but what she
expected before now; the
Witness replied, that if she
the Witness had been as
near the Dutchess as the
said Mrs. <font>Sturton</font> , she
would have prevented all
this, to which Mrs. 
<font>Sturton</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> would you have
had me whipt at the 
Carts-Arss; The Discourse we
had, was, that Mrs. 
<font>Knifton</font> told her, when I came
from <font>London</font> , on <font>Fryday</font>
Night, that she told me
she was glad I was come,
for she expected her 
Throat to be cut every
Night since my Lord
Duke went to <font>Portsmouth</font> ,
I askt her the Reason of
her Fear, she answered,
<pagebreak id="B2VC2" />
<font>Germain</font> has laid with my
Lady Dutchess ever since
my Lord Duke went to
<font>Portsmouth</font> , that when he
came Home, he would
hear of it, and he would
kick her for a Bawd; and
if she should tell my Lord,
<font>Germain</font> would cut her
Throat: I bid her have a
Care what she said, for
these were dangerous
Words, how can you
prove this, she said, it was
very true, </dialogue><nonSpeech>the Witness
asking her (Mrs. <font>Knifton</font> )
how she knew this, she
said, <font>Germain</font> instead of
going Home, went into
the Closet; The Witness
cannot say that she said all
this to Mrs. <font>Sturton</font> , but
the greatest Part she did
say; Mrs. <font>Sturton</font> said, this
was nothing but what she
expected before, this was
the <font>Tuesday</font> after my Lord
Duke came from 
<font>Portsmouth</font> ; This was about
<font>Bartholomew-Tide</font> , in the
First Year of King <font>James's</font>
Reign.</nonSpeech>
