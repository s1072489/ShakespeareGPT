   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macguire.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do humbly move, that I may have time
allowed me by this Court to send for my Witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have had a long time; you were indicted 
about the beginning of the last Terme, you might have
prepared Witnesses the last Terme.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not expect a Triall.
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You should expect it at your perill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was told, when I came into the Kingdome, that I
might have Witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The proofe lies upon the Kings part.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Though the proofe be of the Kings part, yet I must
have time to cleere my selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But if every man should ask so much time as you
require, he should never come to his Triall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sergeant Whitfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Justice <font>Bacon</font> , we know     
that my
L. <font>Macguire</font> was indicted here the last Terme, he was
arraigned at this Barre, he pleaded, <font>Not guilty</font> , he could not but
expect that he had then been tried, if it had not been for the
plea of Peerage, that he then put in, upon which he knows
there was a deliberate dispute, and he could not tell but that
there would be an end before this time; and if he had had
any Witnesses, he might have sent for them the last Terme:
but it is a very unusuall course, especially in that he could
not but expect that he should be tried before this time, but
then the Court did conceive this was a legall information.
No place is mentioned by the Prisoner where the
Witnesses should be, nor are they named who they are, nor any
particular thing that they should testifie: but the proof lies
cleere on our part; there's no justification in Treason, if we
prove that this Lord hath committed Treason, there's no
justification of that, by any Witnesses he can produce.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lord <font>Grey</font> , that was L. Deputy of        
Ireland,
committed his Treasons in Ireland, for which hee was
brought over hither, and tried here, yet the Court did
not stay for his sending over into Ireland for Witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire Witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can your Witnesses say for you? Can they
say thus much, That you did not conspire, as this
Indictment charges you? that there was no taking of these
<pagebreak id="3" />
Castles? Can they sweare in the Negative? the proofe lies
in the Affirmative on the Kings Part?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They may be mis-informed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who may be mis-informed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Court. I have been kept close prisoner a long
time, and could not provide my Witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ser. Whitfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we were not tied to that, to nothing 
but
his own Confession, there's enough to condemne him, for
that he saies he was kept close prisoner, he might have
desired that the last Terme.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sergeant Roll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we go upon your own Examination, the
witnesses concurring with that, what can you have?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had witnesses here, we would hear them,
but to stay upon a meere verball supposall, for those
witnesses in Ireland, they may be in that rebellion too, and they
will never come hither, and so the matter must never come
to a Triall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire that it may be the next Terme.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We cannot protract time, they are the Kings
Witnesses, there are (I suppose) divers here, many
Witnesses of the Kings come out of Ireland, if you will aske them
any Questions for your defence, you shall: There are many
Witnesses of the Kings that know how things were in
Ireland, the Court shall put them to speake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mac.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I humbly desire to have a formall Triall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what respect do you meane? I think it is so
now: Now you are come to be arraigned, and the evidence
is to come in against you, I conceive it is a formall one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Prisoner was required to hold up his hand at
the Barre; and it was demanded, if he would challenge any
of the Jury that were to passe upon him in matter of life and
death.
   Then the Jury being called, he lookt upon them, and
<pagebreak id="4" />
challenged those which did appeare, being 23. there being
onely one absent, being demanded whether his challenge
was peremptory or no? He answered, it was, for causes
best knowne to himselfe.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<comment type="compiler">LIST OF JURY MEMBERS THAT WERE CHALLENGED OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ser. Whit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Prisoner hath challenged all the Jury
that does appeare, 23. appeares, and he hath challenged
them, and his challenge is for causes best known to himself,
which is a peremptory challenge. Truely, it is that which
the Law doth allow, and we do not oppose it, but we doe
desire that wee may have another Writ returnable to
morrow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must have a <font>Venire facias</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj. Whit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This cause is a cause of very great weight,
there are many Witnesses that have long attended in Court,
we are informed, that some of them are gone away into
Ireland; that there is the Sheriffe of <font>Dublin</font> and some others
that are now present in Court, that cannot be here, if wee
should deferre this Triall, as the Prisoner doth desire, and
we do desire that it may be referred till to morrow, we shall
be ready to give in evidence against him.

   <nonSpeech>Sir <font>William Stewards</font> Testimony.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   I was one of the Committee that was sent by the
Parliament, and by Order from the House of Lords, to search the
Parliament house, and the Lord <font>Macguire</font> was one of the
Lords; they made a very strict search, and then they
inquired for the Kings Magazine, and I believe my Lord
<font>Macguire</font> now here was one of the Committee that went to
search for the House of Lords, and he did search very
narrowly, and they were desirous to know where the Store
was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lord <font>Blaneys</font> Testimony.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether this search were moved by the Lord
<font>Finghall</font> and what was the end of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Blaney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So neer as I can, I will give you the         
businesse,
it is so long agoe: this I remember, that there was one of
the Lords house, whether it were my Lord <font>Finghall</font> , or my
L. <font>Macary</font> , moved it, I cannot certainly despose, but I am
sure it was one of them: the occasion was, one of the Earl of
<font>Straffords</font> coachmen said, he hoped to see some of the Lords
blowne up for it, it was about a fortnight after the Earle of
<font>Strafford</font> was beheaded here. Thereupon they got an Order
for it, and so they went downe, and they did not finde the
powder, but they made as narrow a search as ever any was;
I asked what the meaning was of this, for we had strange
censures of it our selves, saies of them, the L. <font>Clamorris</font> , they
are affraid of a powder-plot of the Protestants: I answered,
that I had heard a powder-plot of the Papists, but never of
the Protestants in my life; but if you aske the reason of it,
it was to assure themselves of the strength, for we found by
wofull experience afterwards, it was their end. My Lord
<font>Borlace</font> said, let them not be affraid, for upon my honour
<pagebreak id="13" />
there is no powder below. It's a great House, the House of
Commons sit on one side, and the Lords on the other, and
the Blockhouse in the middle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What Religion is my Lord <font>Fingshall</font> , and my Lord
<font>Clamorris</font> , of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> B.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The L. <font>Fingshall</font> is a Papist, and              
<font>Clamorris</font> a
pestiferous Papist!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.VV.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All Papists we shall now read the examination of
the manner of his taking, and then his own examination.
   The first we shall read is this, of M. <font>VVoodcock</font> , that was
Sheriffe of Dublin he was in town, but he could not stay,
but he was examined before this Court.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We desire to shorten, we have a great many         
Witnesses;
we shall goe upon these particulars. I. Captaine <font>Oneales</font> landing 
in
Ireland, and what he brought with him. 2. <font>Guilo</font> and <font>Crocan</font> .
Lastly, how long besieged, and how many murthered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Sir <font>William Steward</font> gave in testimony to this effect:
   That <font>Con Owen Oneale</font> landed in July the same yeare the        
Rebellion
began, brought many Commanders, much Armes and Ammunition;
many of his Commanders, nine of the chiefe of them, were taken
prisoners at one battell.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is his own confession, that he sent a Priest    
over to fetch   
Armes to come into Ireland.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lady <font>Calfield</font> was desired to declare her knowledge
concerning the taking of Charlemont castle.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady Calfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 23. of Octob. 1641. Sir <font>Philom     
Oneale</font> and
others came into the castle, they seized upon all, murthered his
servants; and those that were alive, they bound them, and put them in
prison: and at that time Sir <font>Philom Oneale</font> himselfe, and other of
his companions told her, <font>That Dublin castle and city, and most other
Forts of Ireland, were surprized by their confederates the Papists:  
and
that he was sorrie for his cosin the Lord</font> Macguire, <font>and that he  
was
afraid he was taken</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was done with my Lord <font>Calfield</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La. Calfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was murthered: he beg'd for his life,  
and they
durst not but doe it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When Sir <font>Philom Oneale</font> had taken my Lord       
<font>Calfield</font> , then
they got this Lady to write to the Lords Justices, that my L.
<font>Macguire</font> might be exchanged for her sonne, but that would not    
be: and
thereupon they murdered my Lord <font>Calfield</font> , <font>Francis Davis</font> , and
others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mary Wordroses</font> Testimony.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   That he came on Friday night about 10. or 11. a clock, to breake
into the castle; I hearing the noise, asked what was the matter: I
went to call up some of our Gentlemen: when I came in againe,
they had taken some of our Gentlemen, and bound them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>She also testified the murdering of the Lord <font>Calfield</font> ,     
<font>Francis
Davis</font> , and others; and the former words concerning the Lord
<font>Macguire</font> .</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="21" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These two Witnesses prove that of Charlemont, how  
farre
the Rebells owned the L. <font>Macguire</font> , as to endeavour his exchange.
We shall now come to the other Castles, how long they besieged
them, and who was murthered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Walter Gubsons</font> Testimony.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   They besieged it a quarter of a year before they tooke it, divers 
of
the chief conspirators, and <font>Powell</font> , and <font>Cosens</font> , tooke the  
Castle by
force in an hostile manner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Francis Hamiltons</font> Testimonie.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   <font>Philip O Rely</font> came to the Castle to Guilo and Crogan Castles, 
and
they lay before it a quarter of a yeer, with 2000. or 3000. men,
somtimes 1500. but never lesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Charles Cootes</font> Testimony concerning the generality of the
Rebellion.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Sir <font>Philom O Neale</font> and <font>Roger Moore</font> were the actors in the
massacres, and by publike directions of some in place, and of the
Titulary Bishops, for the sending of an exact account of what Persons 
were murthered throughout all Vlster, a fourth part of the Kingdom
of Ireland, to the Parish Priests in every Parish, and they sent in a
particular account of it, and the account was, an hundred foure
thousand seven hundred, in one Province, in the first three moneths
of the Rebellion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you concerning the generall Counsell, and 
the
Popes Bull?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.C. Coote.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The supreame Counsell they tooke up a new   
forme
of government upon them of their owne, and by this authority it
was granted to the Lady <font>Macguire</font> , that she should have the Rent
of such Lands in recompence of the losse that he was at in their     
causes
They have made severall Judges of their own Courts: They print,
they coyn, they do all in their own names.

    <sample id="SAMPLE 4">

<pagebreak id="25" />
   <nonSpeech>Then the Lord <font>Macguire</font> proceeded to make his defence,       
wherein he
first of all denied his Examination (although testified as before by 
so
many credible witnesses) and said that he knew no such Examination.  
   That at the time of his apprehension at Dublin, he came about his
own particular occasions, as his Estate was in danger if he did not
follow it: That because he was found about the City, he was therefore
apprehended; That his lodging was not within the City, but he lodged
without the City; that he did lodge at Mr. <font>Nevils</font> House          
formerly, but
not at this time: That for some of the places mentioned, where he
should be about the Conspiracy, he had not been there a year before,
he was certain of it. For the number of Protestants that were
mentioned to be slain, he said he did not think there were so many   
Protestants
in the whole Kingdome. That he was continually either at his owne
House, or at Dublin, and knew nothing of the Plot but by hear-say.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You confesse in your Examination, when the day    
was for the
rising, that you were in the conspiracy, and appointed for the       
taking of
Dublin Castle; and that you were taken when you came about it. 
Also you rode about it, and provided Armes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was in the house in the Cock-loft where I was   
taken, I
did not know where any Army was!
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S.W.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Macguire</font> does forget himself what he
acknowledges under his own hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Examination being shewed him he said;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Theres my name
but not my hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sorry to hear it, I did rather expect, that  
you should have
acknowledged it; Here are two able witnesses that can testifie it    
against
you, your denying your own hand, which is so manifestly proved, will
be a great discredit to what you say; you acknowledged it at two
severall times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did I acknowledge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say that you came to Dublin to settle your    
estate: By
your own Examination you acknowledge, That the Castle of Dublin
was to be surprised by your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is now time we should draw to the Jury: You     
hear my
Lord Bramston and my Brother <font>Finch</font> here justifie it to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the L. <font>Macguires</font> Examination was shewed to my L.       
<font>Blaney</font> ,
being present in Court, demanding whether he thought it to be
<font>Macguires</font> hand or no?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Blaney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is my Lords own hand, he hath written to  
me many 
Letters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't think I have written many Letters to your 
Lordship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen of the Jury you may go to the           
businesse; If there
were nothing but that you see in this case but what is in the
examination if you do beleeve to be his: His confession does         
acknowledge it:
you hear this by the testimony of my Lord <font>Bramston</font> , and my      
brother
<font>Finch</font> , expresly that were present when he did acknowledge it    
and set
his hand to it, and yet you see though it is here proved by my Lord
<font>Blaney</font> he denies it, If you finde this to be true here is        
treason enough,
and too much too, for he does here confesse; That <font>Roger Moore</font> did
acquaint him; That if the Irish did rise, they might make their own
conditions for regaining their lands; and he acquainted him, That he
had spoken with sundry in Leinster, that would be ready for that
purpose, and that a great part of Conaught would do the like; and then
moved him (this Lord) the prisoner at the Barre, to joyn likewise with
him, which he did, so then was the plot. The next day they met, he
goes to <font>Moores</font> Chamber again, where Col <font>Mac Brian</font> ,          
<font>Mac-mahun</font> ,
and others, had discourse again about it, then he sayes; That they did
send over to <font>Owen O Neal</font> , to acquaint him concerning the generall
Rebellion in Ireland, then in preparation. He confesses expresly; That
<pagebreak id="27" />
being demanded why the said <font>Owen</font> should bring over Armes, seeing
the Castle of Dublin was to be surprised, answered: That they so
provided Armes, that they might not want any thing, if they should not
take it, whereof they doubted. And then you have him 
acknowledgeing, that the Castle of Dublin was to be surprised by     
himself, and
Captain <font>Brian O Neal</font> , and others; These words shew here         
expresly, That
the day whereon the execution was appointed, by the Lord <font>Maguires</font>
own confession, he was come to Dublin for the surprise of the Castle.
So that it is apparent, that he was about this plot expresly. If     
this be
true; That you did conspire to make warre or Rebellion within that
Kingdome, though you were taken your self before it was executed,
yet it was your own conspiracie: And besides, endeavouring after that
to bring it to perfection, by sending over for Armes. All these does
discover your own intention to execute it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confesse it not, I referre my self to the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen you are to know, that to conspire to    
raise a
Warre, if any of that Conspiracy do Act it, as you see here Sir
<font>Philome O Nele</font> did, if you observe the Testimonie of my La.      
<font>Calfield</font> , he
came and surprised the Castle of Charlemont, and then it was given
out, that my Lord <font>Maguire</font> had taken Dublin, so that though it did
not take effect, That which is done by any is testimonie enough.
   Goe together and consider of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Upon this the Jury went together, and staying a short space,
returned their verdict, which was; That they found him guilty of all
the Treasons according to the Indictment.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   C. Conner <font>Maguire</font> , alias <font>Cornelius Maguire</font> ; Thou hast   
been
indicted of severall high Treasons, and thou Hast been Arraigned;
Upon the Arraignment, Thou hast pleaded not guilty, and for thy
Triall hast put thy self upon thy countrey, which countrey have found
thee guilty, according to the Indictment, Therefore prepare thy self
to receive the sentence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know by what Law?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Law is well enough Knowne; That is, a        
Treason is
within the Statute <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Satute</comment> without doubt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not tried by my Peeres.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a generall Exception, formerly annexed   
in your
plea, If you can shew some particular cause also, you shall be heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire counsell to advise me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you did put in a plea therein, you had      
councel to
<pagebreak id="28" />
advise you in your plea and to argue it; Now your time is past for
counsell, you must have none assigned to picke holes in the
Inditement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire the Court would consider of it before    
they proceed
to sentence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You offer nothing to the Court that is of any    
difficultie,
you had counsell whether you should be tried by your Peers or the
Jury here, which jury are to try any man under a Nobleman in this
Kingdome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Magu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know under what seal you thus proceed 
against
me, for I thinke you sit here by the new seal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What seal do you mean, I sit here by vertue of   
the Olde by
Order of Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mag.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Vnder favour I conceive, that the Ordinance of     
Parliament
for the New seal, makes all done by the old seal to be voide.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is nothing done but by good authority, and  
the
Parliaments approbation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mag.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I conceive the Ordinance for the New seal cuts off 
all
proceedings of the olde.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Iudge.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My authority is not cut off, I was made by the Olde    
Seale
before there was any New Seale, and so I am continued by the
Parliament, and the Parliament did take notice that I have been
allowed to sit. Besides this, there is nothing done in this Court by 
the
New Seale, the Sheriffs are here by a Charter, and that comes in from
yeer to yeer and there is no Seale in order of execution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Iudge.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well if you have nothing to say for your selfe, I am to
pronounce sentence as I am a Minister of Iustice: you have been      
Indited
here for severall Treasons contained in your inditement as was here of
late read unto you, and you have had a fair proceeding &amp; very 
deliberately: for your inditement came in about <font>Alhallowmas</font>      
last, three
weekes or a Moneth before the end of the last Terme, three weeks
at least; you then made a question whether you ought to be tried
by your Peers in Ireland, or a Jury here, the Court did so far
deliberate in it as to allow you Counsell to plead with the best     
advantage
you could. And afterwards this Terme, there hath been two
arguments at the Barre on each side, where hath been said as much for
you as can be. The Court ouer ruled that, and so you are tried by
a Jury, and you had the Liberty to challenge them, and had all the
<pagebreak id="29" />
advantages that the Law will afford and take all the exceptions you
could. Truely for my part, I see, that there is not any one of them  
for
me to sway the Judgement: The Treason and the Offences that you
are charged withall are very hainous, your crimes very impious,
great destruction hath followed upon your plot which the Jury have
found you guilty of? What a mighty cruell war and great
devastation in that Kingdome, most horrid to speak or rehearse: It   
is fitter for
you now to bethinke your selfe, what your offences are, and prepare
your selfe for death rather then seek to mask or put colours upon    
those
things which are so manifestly proved to all the world: And now you
are found guilty, and therefore there is no contradiction or
gainsaying will avail you, you ought to repent and pray to God to    
forgive that
offence whereof <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wheof</comment> you are guilty. The Judgement 
that I am by the Law to
pronounce against you is this: <font>Connor Maguire</font> Esquire, You being
found guilty of the Treasons whereof you are indicted, your
Judgement is; That you shall bee carried from hence to the place from
whence you came, that is the Tower, and from thence to Tiburne
the place of execution, and there you shall be hanged by the neck, and
cut downe alive, your bowels taken out and burnt before your face,
your head to be cut off, your body to be divided into four quarters,
and the head of your body to be set up and disposed of as the State  
shal
appoint. And the Lord have mercy upon your soule.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>After judgment pronounced, the Kings Councell demanded of him,
whether he would have any Ministers come to him, to prepare him
for his end, and to advise him for the good of his soul?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire none of them; but I desire I may be sent 
Prisoner to
Newgate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Counc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His reason is, because there are some Popish     
Priests there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That cannot be; your judgement is to return to    
the Tower,
where you may have Ministers (if you please) to return to advise you
for your soul.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire you that some Gentlemen of my own        
Religion may
have accesse to me to conferre with me, and some who are my fellow
Prisoners in the Tower, to speak with me in my Keepers presence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must name some body in perticular.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to conferre with Mr. <font>Walter            
Mountague</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Belike
he knew him to be a Popish Priest or Jesuite.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Iudg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must prepare your selfe to die against        
Saturday next.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Macg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire a fortnights time to prepare my self.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is too long a space, and I cannot grant it, but    
you shall
have convenient time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Macg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire you, that I may have three dayes notice at     
least, to
prepare my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have three dayes warning, but however delay no
time to prepare your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Macg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire my execution may be altered, and not according 
to
the judgement; and that I may not be hanged and quartered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This lies not in my power to grant; but here are some
Members of the House of Commons in Court, and you were best addresse
your self to them, that they may acquaint the House with your desires.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Macg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall desire the Gentlemen of the House of Commons, so
many as are here, to move the House in my behalf, that I may have a
fortnights time to prepare my self, and that the manner of my
execution may be changed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Iohn Clotworthy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have been your          
Schoole-fellow
heretofore, and have found some ingenuity in you, and I have seen some
Letters of yours imparting some remorse of conscience in you for this
fact, and I should be glad to discern the like ingenuity in you still;
And shall move the House, that you may have some Ministers
appointed to come to you: and likewise acquaint them with your other
desires.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the prisoner departing from the Barre, Mr. <font>Prynne</font>       
advising
him to conferre with some godly Ministers, for the good and comfort
of his soul; He answered, That he would have none at all, unlesse he
might have some Romish Priests of his own Religion.
   To which Mr. <font>Prynne</font> replied;</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, these Romish Priests  
are
the chief Instruments, who have advised you to plot and perpetrate
those execrable Treasons for which you are now condemned, and have
brought upon you that shamefull judgement of a Traitor; the
execution whereof you even now so earnestly deprecated. Since then   
they
have proved such evill destructive Counsellors, to you in your life, 
you
have great reason to disclaim them with their bloody religion, and to
seek out better advisers for you at your death, lest you eternally   
lose
your soul, as well as your life; for the bloud of those many thousand
Innocents which have been shed by your meanes. </dialogue><nonSpeech>To which he
pawsing a little, answered: That he was resolved in his way. Whereupon
another Lawyer said;</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, you were best to hear both sides. </dialogue><nonSpeech>To  
which he answered, in an obstinate manner;</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am setled on one side
<pagebreak id="31" />
already, and therefore I desire not to conferre with any of the other:
</dialogue><nonSpeech>And so departed through the Hall towards the Tower, the people
crouding and running about to behold his person.</nonSpeech>
