</dialogue><nonSpeech>She was indicted by the name of <font>Joan Buts</font> , late of <font>Yoel</font> , 
in the County
of <font>Surrey</font> , for that she being a common <font>Witch</font> and            
<font>Inchantress</font> , and not
having the fear of God before her eyes, but moved by the instigation

Farmer</font> , and brought her into a languishing Condition; in which    
languishing
Condition she continued until she died.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>She was indicted a second time, for that she being a common     
<font>Witch</font> and 
<font>Inchantress</font> , &amp;c. she not having the fear of God before her      
eyes, but guided by the
Instigation of the Devil, she had by her wicked and devilish Art,    
bewitched 
<font>Elizabeth Burrige</font> , and brought her into a languishing           
Condition, &amp;c. To both
which Indictments she pleaded Not Guilty <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Gulty</comment> ;    
and for Tryal, put her self upon God
and her Country.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Witnesses being sworn, the Parents of <font>Mary Farmer</font>       
swore, That their
Child being taken ill in an extraordinary and violent manner, the    
Neighbours
told them it was bewitched, and perswaded them to go to Dr.          
<font>Bourn</font> , which they
did, and <font>Bourn</font> told them, That their Child was under an ill      
Tongue, and
advised them to save the Childs water, and put it into a Bottle,     
stopping it close,
and bury it in the Earth, and to burn the Childs Clothes, assuring   
them, that
then the <font>Witch</font> which had done her the hurt, would come in; and   
that accordingly
they did so; and when the Childs clothes was burning, <font>Joan Buts</font>  
came in, and sat
her down upon a Stool, looking with a most frightful and gastly      
Countenance;
and being asked by a Woman that was there present, what she ailed?   
she answered,
<pagebreak id="2" />
She was not well, nor had been out in seven weeks before;</nonSpeech><dialogue> why      
would you
come out now then, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Woman?</nonSpeech><dialogue> I could not forbear coming    
to see you,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said she; and with that, she threw down her Hat and tumbled down,
wallowing on the ground, making a fearful and dismal noise; and      
being got up, she
fell a cursing in a most horrid manner. To this purpose swore divers 
others, who
were present at the same time.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Elizabeth Burrige</font> , who was one of the persons bewitched,  
swore, That going
out of her Masters house in the evening, towards the Barn-door, she  
saw a
Goose, or some such creature, coming towards her; whereat being much
affrighted, she run in a doors, telling them what she saw;           
whereupon, her Mistris, with
some others of the house, went out to see if they could see any      
thing; and being
out, there were stones thrown at them from every side, and they      
could not see
from whence they came; so that they were forced to retire into the   
house; 
and having shut the door, the stones were thrown as fast in at the   
window,
and yet not one Quarrel of Glass broken. Her Master swore, that she  
being
in the middle of the Room, she suddenly screamed out, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue>      
Something is
got into my back, </dialogue><nonSpeech>when going to her, he pulled out a great piece   
of Clay
from about the middle of her back, stuck as full of pins as ever it  
could hold.
The Maid swore also, That going the next morning a milking, she saw  
<font>Joan
Buts</font> , bedagling her self among the Bushes; whereat being          
affrighted, she came
home and told them, that she had met such a woman that used to come a
begging to the house, she not then knowing her name; but they told   
her, it was
Goody <font>Buts</font> . Her Master swore likewise, that sending her up      
stairs, to fetch
him something out of a Trunk, she called out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Master, here is      
Goody <font>Buts</font> ;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>but going up stairs with several others, they could not see her,   
but they saw
several things in the Chamber move out of their places, there being  
no body
near them; and that coming down stairs, an Andiron that stood in the
Chimney, removed out of its place, and flying over their heads, fell 
down before them; 
and that the Maid crying out again, that something was got into her  
back, he took
out another great piece of Clay, stuck as full of thorns as the      
other was of
pins.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Others swore, That they had divers times taken out pins from    
the Arms, and
other parts of <font>Mary Farmar</font> ; which was also proved by divers     
others that had seen
them taken out.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And one of the Evidences swore, that he heard her say, That if  
she had not
bewitched her, if all the Devils in Hell could help her, she would   
bewitch her.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>She pleaded, she was innocent, and that those things that were  
sworn against her,
were not true. My Lord asked her, if she did not speak those words:  
she
acknowledged she did:</nonSpeech><dialogue> but my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a            
passionate woman, and they having
urged me, I spake those words in passion, my Lord, but I intended no 
such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>She said of one of the Witnesses, whose name is <font>Hakeing</font> ,   
and reputed to be a very
sober man, that he had given himself to the Devil Soul and Body. My  
Lord Chief
Justice asked her, How she knew he had done so; to which not being   
able to give
any answer, my Lord cheked, and told her that she must not abuse the 
Witnesses at
that rate. There was in all about Ninteen or Twenty Witnesses        
against Her. And
the Tryal was near three hours long. The Jury having been some time  
out, returned and
gave in their Verdict that she was not Guilty, to the great          
amazement of some who
thought the Evidence sufficient to have found her Guilty; yet others 
who consider the
great difficulty in proving a Witch, thought the Jury could do no    
less than acquit
her.</nonSpeech>
