<nonSpeech> <font>Chatham</font> , Ship <font>London</font> , <font>October the 21st</font> , 1745.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>The Court ordered the Marshal to bring in the Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Captain</font> JOHN AMBROSE <font>brought into Court</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Lieutenant <font>Hugh Palliser</font> was called in and sworn. Then
his Deposition was read, setting forth, that he was first
Lieutenant of the <font>Essex</font> , during the Month of <font>February</font>
1743; which Ship, on the 11th of the said Month, was
stationed next a-stern of the <font>Dorsetshire</font> and the third
a-stern of the Admiral in the Engagement off <font>Toulon</font> ;
that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> and <font>Rupert</font> bore down when the
Admiral did, but not so near as the Admiral and 
<font>Marlbro'</font> , nor near enough to form the Line; that the
<font>Dorsetshire</font> began to engage soon after the Admiral, but he
believes not within Point-blank; that the Fireship bore
down, and pass'd by in sight of the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> ,
<pagebreak id="43" />
and <font>Royal Oak</font> , and that they then were to windward of
the Line, and might have conducted and covered her, but
none of them did; that the <font>Marlbro'</font> was disabled, and
that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Essex</font> , and <font>Rupert</font> were then to
windward; and that the <font>Rupert</font> , if she had pass'd by the
<font>Dorsetshire</font> , might have assisted the <font>Marlbro'</font> , and might
have covered the Fireship.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this Deposition   
true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> never in the Line? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she ever within Point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not when I saw her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time did you see her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw her several times that Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship go down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> attempt to cover her?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she ever attempt to cover the <font>Marlbro'</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She went down to the <font>Marlbro'</font> at Night, when we
wore, but not before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she near you when you brought up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, she presently fell farther a-stern of us and to
leeward, but not so far as to form the Line.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she ever within Point-blank? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time was the <font>Royal Oak</font> engaged with the three
<font>Spanish</font> Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any thing of the <font>Royal Oak</font> and
<font>Rupert</font> driving away the first Ship they engaged before the 
Wind?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never saw any of the <font>Spanish</font> Ships         
a-stern of
their Admiral, but before the Wind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Royal Oak</font> engage them?           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To windward of the <font>Royal Oak</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far to windward?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A long Mile from, but not so far to windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> then engag'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, the <font>Rupert</font> was then farther from the Enemy   
than
the <font>Royal Oak</font> by a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you see the <font>Royal Oak</font> engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe an Hour after the Admiral began.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Ship for you to engage at first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if we had gone into our Station.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you haul'd your Wind was there any Ship before
your Beam? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
<pagebreak id="44" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> bear away before the Admiral wore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell exactly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she in a Line with the <font>Namur</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say; she was not so far to Leeward as the
Admiral was when he began to engage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Namur</font> considerably to windward of the
<font>Marlborough</font> then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Just before the Admiral made the Signal and wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About half an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> firing then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she within Gun-shot? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When she bore away, half an Hour before the Admiral
wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she then engaging briskly? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Royal Oak</font> engage within 
Point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was pretty near it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it in the <font>Rupert's</font> Power to have gone down   
with
her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I saw nothing to hinder her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> any way disabled?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she cou'd not be disabled, because she had had no
Engagement before that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw the <font>Rupert</font> firing smartly, where was
the headmost of the five of the Enemy coming up in respect
of the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was when one or two of the headmost Ships fired at
the Fireship, and they were then shot past the <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the <font>Rupert</font> then in respect to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Abreast of us, half a Mile nearer the Enemy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you fire a Gun then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time of the Day was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did your Shot fall short? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> then half a Mile nearer the Enemy
than you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Enemy return any Shot to you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any Shot go over the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at that time; when we wore there did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal Oak</font> had engaged      
those Ships as
closely as they ought to have done, wou'd they have stopped
<pagebreak id="45" />
those Ships from annoying ours, and hinder'd                         
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: hinder d</comment> them from
getting up till the Vice-Admiral's Division had got up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Here the Prisoner interrupted, and said, he apprehended that
was not a proper Question.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>The Court said</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> We have a Right to ask any Questions we
think fit, and you are at liberty to ask any Question
you think proper, and we have shewn you a particular
Indulgence in that respect.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Witness answer'd.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We wou'd have   
attack'd
them with five of our Ships, that is, the <font>Essex</font> , <font>Rupert</font> ,   
<font>Royal
Oak</font> , <font>Dunkirk</font> , <font>Cambridge</font> ; but I can't say whether the    
<font>Rupert</font>
and <font>Royal Oak</font> only cou'd have stop'd them <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: then</comment> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the <font>Dunkirk</font> , or <font>Cambridge</font> near enough  
to attack
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If they had gone into their Station, they would have 
been
near enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Hercules</font> go near to assist  
the Ship
attack'd by the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal Oak</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Shot go over the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What distance was the headmost from the <font>Dunkirk</font> ,
and <font>Cambridge</font> from the <font>Royal Oak</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Cambridge</font> bear under the    
<font>Royal
Oak's</font> Stern?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, just before we wore, and she fired at the Enemy
under the <font>Royal Oak's</font> starboard Quarter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw the <font>Cambridge</font> under the             
<font>Royal Oak's</font>
Stern, where was the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was just before we wore, she was then firing at
the Enemy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember, when the Admiral wore, how many
of the four or five Sail of the Enemy had past before the
<font>Rupert's</font> Beam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell exactly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You was a-head and could see.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember whether any of them open'd a-head
of the <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was any of them a-head of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I fired a Shot, I don't remember whether the
two headmost were a-head or a-stern of the <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> then directly to leeward of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, half a Mile nearer the Enemy, it cou'd not
be more, because of our wearing soon after, and we had not
Room to wear short of her, but soon fell on board of her,
which obliged us to shift our Helm, by which we were jostled
<pagebreak id="46" />
down very near the Enemy; the Fire from the Muzzel of
our Guns set her Spritsail on fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> directly a-breast of you then?    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the Admiral in respect of you when the
<font>Rupert</font> was a-breast of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon our Lee-Bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> between you and the Enemy when you
fired?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I fired two single Shot from our lower Deck, with
the Guns laid down in the Carriage, both which I saw fall
short.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the five of the Enemy continue their Course
under the same Sail? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Supposing the <font>Rupert</font> had bore down in a Line with
the Admiral, and brought up in a Line when he did, how
long would it have been before the <font>Rupert</font> would have had
any Ship to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> had gone down and brought up in a  
Line
with the Admiral, she would have been in a proper Position
to engage the five Sail of the Enemy coming up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> stop those Ships from getting up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I believe not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From the beginning of the Engagement till the Admiral
wore, did you ever observe the <font>Rupert</font> annoy the Enemy in
any Shape whatever?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she fired a good deal, but not within a Distance 
to
do Execution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Shot of the Enemy come over the
<font>Rupert</font> , when she was a-breast of you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship go down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any of the Enemy fire at her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The headmost of the five Sail did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Rupert within Gun-shot of them then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Essex</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Essex</font> always to windward of the          
<font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any Shot of the Enemy reach you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, at first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the <font>Rupert</font> off you then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To leeward of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you from the time the Shot reach'd you, continue 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: cotinue</comment>
hauling off? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> haul off too? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the meaning of your hauling off?
<pagebreak id="47" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>The Witness made no Answer, but smiled, so did the
Court.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you received any Damage, or had the <font>Rupert</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> continue hauling off?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, till she bore away again, and begun to fire     
briskly
in the Evening.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it from the <font>Rupert's</font> first bearing  
up, till
she bore down again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw that she bore away again from the
Beginning, till half an Hour before the Admiral wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> had received any     
Damage
to prevent her going into her Station?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, at no time of the Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Evening,   
when you
wore, did not you engage the five <font>Spanish</font> Ships a-stern, and
how was it possible, if once they got a-head of the <font>Rupert</font> , for
the <font>Rupert</font> to wear and engage them in passing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Rupert</font> had bore away, and was firing at those
Ships upon the Admiral's wearing; it was then that I observed
the <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the five Ships once past me, how could I go under
the Stern of the Admiral and all the other Ships, and
engage those five Ships in passing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were not a-breast of you when you fired at them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say that I was engaged with the five Ships, that
I was half a Mile from you, and that I was out of
point-blank, then how could I shoot up to you in the Wearing, and
engage the five Ships in passing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You did not shoot up to us, we came down to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engage a single   
Ship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far were the five Ships of the Enemy from you
when the Admiral first engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three Miles, as near as I can judge, not so far      
a-stern,
rather upon our lee-quarter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Ships were there a-stern of the             
<font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Five.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Sail had the five Ships out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say particularly, the two headmost had all   
their
Sails set.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they all come up in a Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They appeared to me so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did they bear from you then, and how did your
Head lye?
<pagebreak id="48" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were lying to, close to the Wind, and they were
right a-stern of us by springing our Luff from them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Royal Oak</font> fire before the <font>Rupert</font> ?   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the <font>Royal-Oak</font> and <font>Rupert</font> firing         
together at the
same Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, in the Evening, when you was firing briskly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As the <font>Rupert</font> was between you and the Enemy, how
could you distinguish whether I was near enough to do
Execution?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could judge of the Distance as it appeared to me,  
and
by our Shot falling short by the Distance you were from us,
and the Distance we were from the Enemy; I think we in
the <font>Essex</font> were two Miles from them, and you half a Mile
nearer than we.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I was a Mile and a half off? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From the Situation you lay to windward, could you
judge whether the <font>Rupert</font> was in a Line with the Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, because you was so near us, therefore I am sure
you was not in a Line.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> had gone down in a proper Line at  
first,
would there have been any Ship for her to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had continued going down with an easy Sail till
you had compleated the Line from the <font>Namur</font> , I judge you
would have fell in a-breast of the Headmost Ship of the Five;
for the <font>Royal Oak</font> , by continuing her Course down, fell
a-breast of the Second; a little more of her Port-helm in
going down, would have laid her along-side of the Third,
you might have taken the Second, and we in the <font>Essex</font> the
First.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I had gone down to the Headmost of the Five Ships,
how far should I have been from you, supposing you had
gone in the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At a proper Distance; a Quarter of a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the <font>Hercules</font> from the other three Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three Miles the most at first; but had you gone
down with an easy Sail, as that Space was growing less and
less, when you had got down so far as to be in a Line, you
would have been a-breast of the Headmost of those Ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you far out of your Station at your first
bringing to? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then how could I have any Ship to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But we were a great Way from the Enemy when that
Shot reached us; I judge the <font>Essex's</font> Distance from the
<font>Hercules</font> was about two Miles, and her Weather Guns would
carry a Shot that Distance.
<pagebreak id="49" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Court interrupted, and told the Prisoner, that the
asking those Questions took up a great deal of
Time, and only seem'd proper Questions to be ask'd
his own Witnesses. The Prisoner said, he thought
them material; but if the Court thought they
were not proper Questions, he would submit.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think in the
Situation I was in, if the five Sail of the Enemy had held their
Course they first steer'd, could they have fetch'd me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they steer'd for their Admiral; if they had kept
their Wind close, they might have fetch'd you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you wear a-head or a-stern of the five <font>Spanish</font>
Ships in the Rear, when you wore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We wore and past a-stern of them; when we wore
they were put before the Wind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you engage them as you past?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We engaged with our Larboard Guns when we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner addressed himself to the Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As all
these Gentlemen have been already examined, and
cross-examined upon former Tryals, it will be
impossible for me to find out any Mistakes they are
guilty of; and therefore I would beg of every 
Gentleman that is a Member of the Court, to destroy the
Minutes they have taken upon the former Tryals,
that they may have no Influence in regard to the
Sentence that may be pass'd upon my Conduct.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Captain <font>Renton</font> , one of the Members of the Court, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I believe every Gentleman that is a Member of the
Court, will not only destroy the Minutes taken upon
former Tryals, but endeavour to forget as much as
possible, every thing that has pass'd upon former Tryals.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Prisoner said</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I mention this, not that I have the
least Suspicion of the Court, but because I hope to
prove that you never yet had a right understanding of
the Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The President said</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are not to dictate to the Court;
every Body here are Persons of Honour, and will do
you Justice; and therefore I think that Speech of 
yours very ungenteel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Lieutenant <font>Joseph Peyton</font> of the <font>Essex</font> was called in
and sworn, and his Deposition read, setting forth,
That he was fourth Lieutenant of the <font>Essex</font> , on the
11th of <font>February</font> 1743, which Ship was station'd the
next a-stern of the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , and the third a-stern
of the Admiral; that in the Morning a Signal was
<pagebreak id="50" />
made for a Line a-head, and about one the 
<font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal-Oak</font> bore down when the
Admiral did, but not near enough to form the Line;
that between three and four the <font>Ann Galley</font> Fireship
bore down in Sight of the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and
<font>Royal Oak</font> , and that they were not then engaged;
that the <font>Marlborough</font> was disabled, having her Main
and Mizen-Masts shot away; and that the <font>Essex</font> was
to windward of the <font>Rupert</font> , and the <font>Rupert</font> to 
windward of the <font>Royal Oak</font> ; that they were all to
windward of the Line the greatest Part of the Engagement;
and that if they had bore down as the Admiral and
<font>Marlborough</font> did, they might have cover'd the 
Fireship, and kept the Sternmost Ships of the Enemy from
getting up till the Vice Admiral and his Division had
got up.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font>   
haul up to
windward of the Admiral? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she fire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, between three and four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Ship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Sternmost Ships coming up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she within point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I think not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Marlbro'</font> when her Masts went away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> assist her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship go down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she cover the Fireship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not that I saw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> in the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I don't know how she might have been in the
Evening.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> within point-blank,  
from
the Beginning of the Engagement till the Admiral wore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had gone within point-blank, would she have
been to leeward of the <font>Namur</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Witness asked</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Headmost of the five Ships came up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't judge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was you to windward of the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A good Way; three Quarters of a Mile, or more.
<pagebreak id="51" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the <font>Rupert</font> to leeward of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Cables length and a half.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Time did you observe the <font>Rupert</font> fire smartly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Between three and four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ship did she fire at?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the five Sail coming up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At which of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever observe the five Sail pass before the   
Beam
of the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell whether they did or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they ever alter their Course, or shorten Sail when
they fired at any of our Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, our Ships were at too great a Distance for that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there Wind sufficient for the <font>Rupert</font> to have 
gone
down near enough to have engaged them properly? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the <font>Rupert</font> made a warm Fire, did any of the
Enemy's Shot come over her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any of them fall short? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Royal Oak</font> fire? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must have seen her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the <font>Rupert</font> to windward of the 
<font>Royal-Oak</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Cables length.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To windward or a-head?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon her Weather-bow, to windward and a-head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she as much farther from the Enemy? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you fired the Guns from your Ship, could you
see the <font>Rupert</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you haul'd your Wind, did the <font>Rupert</font> do so
too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't be positive; I did not observe; but when the
<font>Marlbro's</font> Masts were gone, she was to windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> During what Time did you see the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was most of the Time upon the Quarter-deck         
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Quarter-dec k</comment> and
must have seen her often.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Ship did you fire your Guns?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the <font>Hercules</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you fire any at the Sternmost <font>Spanish</font> Ships? 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you haul'd off, did the <font>Rupert</font> do so too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe the <font>Rupert</font> bear down nearer than 
you
at first? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she ever bear down nearer than that?
<pagebreak id="52" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till the Admiral wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Shot reach you from the Enemy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, at the first of the Engagement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> the next Ship to you?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> had bore down at first, might not  
she
have engaged the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in her Power, there was Wind enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner said</font> , He had a great many Questions
to ask, if the Court thought proper.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>The Court said</font> , He might ask what Questions he pleased.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you   
keep
firing at the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Till after the <font>Marlbro's</font> Masts were gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did your Shot reach?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did their Shot reach you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, at first; but we kept hauling off; and when the
<font>Marlbro'</font> lost her Masts we left off firing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Ship for the <font>Rupert</font> to engage, if  
she
had come down at first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not unless she had gone to the <font>Hercules</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Dorsetshire</font> firing upon the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She fired sometimes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had commanded the <font>Rupert</font> , do you think it
would not have been better to have engaged the Ships
coming up, than to have gone to engage the <font>Hercules</font> and assist
the <font>Marlbro'</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Court said</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> That was not a proper Question, we
can best judge of that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any of my Shot fall short?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never saw any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the five Sail coming up, to leeward of their
Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe, rather to leeward, but very little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal Oak</font>        
engaging,
were they to leeward of the Admiral and <font>Marlbro'</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they near one another? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Spanish</font> Ships had held the Course they came
up when the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal Oak</font> were engaging them,
could not they have weather'd the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe they could have gone very near to have
done it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As the <font>Rupert</font> was at first under your            
Lee-quarter, how
came she afterwards to be so far to leeward of you; was it
by your hauling off, or her bearing away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't judge of that.
<pagebreak id="53" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> engaging the five Sail, and between
them and the Fireship, when the Fireship blew up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was not immediately between them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> a-head stemming for the Fireship, 
when
the Fireship blew up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> nearer the Fireship than the five 
Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were nearer when the Fireship blew up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they pass me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As these Ships came up to annoy the Fireship, I must
have stop'd them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Court said</font> , This was argumentative, and no
Answer was given to it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the <font>Rupert</font> was engaging those Ships, were   
they
upon her Quarter, or upon her Beam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rather upon her Quarter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you say my Shot fell short?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Lieutenant <font>Hamilton Gore</font> of the <font>Essex</font> was called in
and sworn, and his Deposition read, setting forth, That
he was a Lieutenant on board the <font>Essex</font> in the Month
of <font>February</font> 1743, which Ship, on the 11th of the same
Month was station'd next a-stern of the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , and
the Third a-stern of the Admiral; that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> ,
<font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal Oak</font> bore down towards the Enemy,
as the Admiral did, but not near enough to form the
Line, tho' they might have done it, having Wind
sufficient; that the Fireship passed by in Sight of the
<font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal Oak</font> , not covered or
conducted by any of the other Ships; that they might have
done it, but did not; that the <font>Marlbro'</font> was disabled,
having her Main and Mizen-mast shot away; that the
<font>Essex</font> was then to windward of all the Ships a-stern;
the <font>Rupert</font> was to windward of the <font>Royal Oak</font> ; that
they all kept to windward of the Line during the
greatest Part of the Engagement; that if they had come
down they might have covered the Fireship, and stopt
the Sternmost Ships of the Enemy from coming up, till
the Vice-Admiral and his Division had got up.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you        
quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the lower Gun-deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Rupert</font> when she first haul'd up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she in a Line with the Admiral?
<pagebreak id="54" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, to windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, she fired.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Time was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little after the Admiral did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Ship did she fire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I took it to be the <font>Hercules</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Distance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Mile and a half, or better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Marlbro'</font> when her Masts went away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> assist her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Fireship bore away, did the <font>Rupert</font> assist
her, or cover her from the Enemy? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she never within point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> in a Line with the
Admiral? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know she was not in a Line with the
Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I saw both her and the Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in the Line? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far to windward of the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the <font>Rupert</font> from you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Better than a Quarter of a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> a Quarter of a Mile to leeward or
a-stern of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To leeward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could the <font>Rupert</font> have engaged the <font>Hercules</font>   
if she had
bore down properly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To be sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Ship between the <font>Rupert</font> and

to take up the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Dorsetshire</font> was between, but she was to

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but they were to leeward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the first of the Action, if the <font>Rupert</font> had    
bore down
and brought up in a Line, was there any Ship for her to
engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She might have engaged if she had gone to the        
<font>Marlbro's</font>
Assistance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had brought up in a Line with the Admiral,    
cou'd
she have engaged? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
<pagebreak id="55" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had brought up at first, could she have       
brought any

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, she did fire at the <font>Hercules</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had she gone down nearer, cou'd she have engaged the
<font>Hercules</font> properly? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> had bore down in a proper Line,    
and kept
there; how long wou'd it have been before the headmost of

proper 
station <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: t ation</comment> to engage the headmost of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she fired, and her Shot all fell short.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see them fall short?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, both the Enemy's and hers fell short; the Enemy's
fell nearer the <font>Rupert</font> , than the <font>Rupert's</font> did the Enemy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you first brought up, what distance was you from
the <font>Dorsetshire</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Better than a quarter of a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the <font>Dorsetshire</font> from you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To leeward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a Line with the <font>Dorsetshire</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> During any part of the Day before the Admiral wore,
were the five Sail shot a-head of the <font>Rupert</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Essex</font> haul her Wind? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any of the five Sail shorten Sail or alter their 
Course
from the Fire of any of our Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, none of them a-stern did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in a Line with the <font>Namur</font> when she was    
haul'd
off toward the latter part of the Action?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> had brought up in a Line, wou'd she
have been within Point-blank of the Enemy? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Rupert</font> had haul'd up in a Line with the
Admiral, where wou'd the headmost of the five Sail have been
from her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within Point-blank.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the five sail pass the <font>Rupert</font> ? 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> bring up when the Admiral did?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure that the <font>Rupert</font> did not keep        
bearing down
after the Admiral haul'd up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think he brought up then.
<pagebreak id="56" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> bring up when the Admiral did?    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Ye</comment> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Court observ'd, every Ship must be in a 
Consternation, when the Admiral brought up.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you take notice of the Enemy's Ships, a short time
before the Admiral wore? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many of them had pass'd the Beam of the
<font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they all had pass'd
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Admiral wore, had any of the Enemy's
shot before the Beam of the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They had shot up nearer their Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All the five.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they all nearer the Fireship than the           
<font>Rupert</font> was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Admiral wore, were the five Ships a-breast,
a-head, or a-stern of the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe a-breast of her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I had bore     
down with the
Admiral at first, and brought up in a Line, how long wou'd
it have been before the five Sail wou'd have been within
Gun-shot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three quarters of an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long must I have been in going into a Line with
the Admiral, if I had put the Helm a-weather, after I had
brought up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half an Hour, or better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When he had got      
there, wou'd
there have been any Ship for him to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he must have been within Point-blank of the 
sternmost Ship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I had not      
brought to when
I did, how long wou'd it have been before I had got into
the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any of the Enemy's Shot reach you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not that I saw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Half Hour that you speak of my getting
into the Line was expir'd, should I have been within
Point-blank of any Ship? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did I fire at the <font>Hercules</font> when I brought to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but the other Ships were a great way from their
Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any of the five Sail pass the
<font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they shot up when the Fireship bore down.
<pagebreak id="57" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner ask'd.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the   
<font>Hercules</font>
from the Ships coming up at the first of the Engagement?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were there four or five Ships coming up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Five.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see a single <font>Spanish</font> Ship, or any Ship   
engage
her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>A.</font> </comment> Did I bring to to leeward

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was I in a Line with the <font>Dorsetshire</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was as much as you were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was you from me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not a great Way then, but we filled our Sails and
hauled our Wind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did I do then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were firing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did I do at first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were firing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you see my Shot fall short?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw it always fall short.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Joseph Meyers</font> of the <font>Essex</font> was called in and sworn.
His Deposition read, setting forth, that he was Master
of the <font>Essex</font> during the Month of <font>February</font> 1743;
that about nine in the Morning of the 11th of the said
Month Admiral <font>Mathews</font> made the Signal for the Line
of Battle a-head, and that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and
<font>Royal Oak</font> were in the Center Division, and stationed
a-stern of the Admiral; that they bore down a little
when the Admiral did, but not near enough to be in their
Stations, and that the <font>Royal Oak</font> was to leeward of the
others, and that they had all Wind enough to have gone
nearer; that the <font>Marlbro's</font> Masts were shot away by the
Enemy, and that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal
Oak</font> were capable of assisting her, but did not; that
between four and five the <font>Ann Galley</font> Fireship bore down,
and was not covered or conducted by any of the other
Ships; and that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal Oak</font>
might have covered her, but they did not, as appeared to
this Witness.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this Deposition   
true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> haul up before she came in the    
Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see her engage within Point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till the Evening, when she wore.
<pagebreak id="58" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see when the <font>Marlbro'</font> lost her Masts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> give her any Assistance?          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship go down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> cover her or attempt it?          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did the <font>Rupert</font> do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She began to fire when we did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did she begin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soon after the Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Ship did she fire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say; either at the <font>Hercules</font> , or the    
Ship a-stern.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did she do after that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She continued firing some time, and all the Shot fell
short.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what distance was she from the Enemy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not within Point-blank.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had gone down at first, was there Room for her
to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She must have gone a-head of us, there was nothing to
hinder her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had gone into her proper Station a-stern of the
Admiral, would she have gone to engage the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, a-head of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Supposing she had left a Space for the <font>Essex</font> and
<font>Dorsetshire</font> , wou'd she then have done Execution upon the
<font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she must then have engaged the headmost of the
five Sail coming up then; but she might have brought some
Guns to bear upon the <font>Hercules</font> .

before you

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Prisoner asked.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the headmost of the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the five Ships to leeward of the Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say, because we were so far to windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Prisoner said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have no more Questions to ask him
now, but desire he may be in the Way lest I should
have Occasion to call him in my Defence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Court told the Witness,</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are to attend till this
Tryal is over: </dialogue><nonSpeech>But upon Recollection, the President 
said, there wou'd be no End, if they suffer'd a 
Witness to be called more than once, and desired that the
Prisoner would ask him what Questions he had to ask
now.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Judge-Advocate acquainted the Court, that he had
known frequently that a Witness has been called in
three or four times, and that he had himself seen it,
and therefore it was determined that he had Liberty
to call him again when he thought proper.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then Lieutenant <font>Edmund Turner</font> of the <font>Royal Oak</font> was
called in and sworn, and his Deposition read, setting

forth, that he was Lieutenant of the <font>Royal Oak</font> on the
11th of <font>February</font> 1743, and that about half past twelve
the Admiral and <font>Marlborough</font> began to fire at the
Enemy; and that all the Captains a-stern of the Admiral
were in sight of the Signal to engage, and of the
Engagement, and that the <font>Rupert</font> was half a Mile to
winward of the <font>Royal Oak</font> ; and that after Captain <font>Williams</font>
had ordered them to cease firing, because of our being

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was abaft the main Mast, and saw the <font>Rupert</font>    
out of
the Weather-Ports, and our People cryed out; <font>Look! Look!
at the</font> Essex <font>and</font> Rupert.

Yes.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Sail had they set?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Foresails, Topsails, and Top-gallant-sails; at the   
first
of the Engagement some of them had their Top-gallant-sails
lowered, and some not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which of them did you engage last?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They headmost of the four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she before your Beam when you engaged her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I think she was abaft the Beam.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you go upon Deck, before you wore Ship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not just before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Time of the Wearing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, when I was ordered to cease firing, then I went
up and saw the Situation of the <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From the Time the Engagement began till the Admiral
wore, was the <font>Rupert</font> ever at a proper Distance from the
Enemy to do Execution and engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw her fire at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see her at a proper Distance to do
Execution?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say; she was upon our Weather-bow, but she
might be within proper Execution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you then at a proper Distance from the Enemy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
<pagebreak id="62" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> always to windward of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship come down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of the <font>Royal Oak's</font> hailing
the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nothing but what I heard afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear the <font>Royal Oak</font> hail the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Lieutenant <font>Robert Wilson</font> of the <font>Royal Oak</font> was called
in and sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>The Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the upper Deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then his Deposition was read, setting forth, that he was
first Lieutenant of the <font>Royal-Oak</font> the 11th of <font>February</font>
1743; that about one, the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlbro'</font> bore
down, and engaged the <font>Real</font> and her Second a-stern;
that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal-Oak</font> , were in
sight of the Signal to engage, and of the Engagement;
that the <font>Royal-Oak</font> was in a Line with the Admiral
during the Engagement, but not with the <font>Marlbro'</font> , and
he then saw the <font>Rupert</font> upon the <font>Royal-Oak's</font> 
Weather-Bow; that the <font>Royal-Oak</font> fired about twelve, but she
was not in a Line with the <font>Marlbro'</font> ; that Capt. <font>Edmund
Williams</font> hail'd Captain <font>Ambrose</font> , and asked why he did
not bear down nearer; that he saw a great many Guns
fired by the <font>Rupert</font> ; that the <font>Marlbro's</font> Masts went
away, and the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal-Oak</font> ,
might have gone down to her Assistance, but did not.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this Deposition   
true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> bring up to windward of the Line of
the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlbro'</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see her engage? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With what Ship? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Ship a-stern of the 
<font>Hercules</font> ,
she had none to engage at first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she within point-blank? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she in a Line with the Admiral? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Marlbro'</font> when her Masts went away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw her about that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little to windward of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she bear away to assist the <font>Marlbro'</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not that she did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship going down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw her before she blew up.
<pagebreak id="63" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> properly engaged?    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> ever in the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What were the Words Captain <font>Williams</font> made use of,
when he hailed the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He asked why he would not bear down, but can't tell
whether there was any Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it the Captain himself that hail'd Captain       
<font>Ambrose</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Words, if he would bear down, or why he
would not bear down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why he would not bear down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Rupert</font> , while you was      
engaged,
engage at a proper Distance to do Execution? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As you did not hear any Answer, did the <font>Rupert</font>   
bear
away upon your hailing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not the <font>Rupert</font> bear away when the            
<font>Royal-Oak</font> did?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Evening when the Signal of Battle was hauled
down, were any of the <font>Spanish</font> Ships past by the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember any of them past the <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe the <font>Rupert</font> bore down when the
<font>Royal-Oak</font> did? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it in the <font>Rupert's</font> Power to engage those     
Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must she have gone to leeward of the Line, if she had
gone at a proper Distance to engage them? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time of the Day did your first bring up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About Two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Close to us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within a Stone's throw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you engage them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three quarters of an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you left off, where was the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were very near her then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not the <font>Rupert</font> engage then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see she did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the Enemy off you then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Ship was a-breast off us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had the <font>Rupert</font> a Ship to engage with then?       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you left off engaging, how far was the <font>Rupert</font>
from you?
<pagebreak id="64" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little way the first time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it after you left off engaging, you hailed the
<font>Rupert</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you make Sail after the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, we lay still.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it after you left off firing the first time,      
that you
hauled up to the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, after we had engaged the four Ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you hail the <font>Rupert</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At Three.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it after engaging the first Ship? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
Yes.   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you haul up to the <font>Rupert</font> after engaging 
the 
first Ship? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, it was after engaging the four Ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> close by you when you engaged the 
first Ships? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As the Enemy shot a-head, did not the <font>Rupert</font>     
engage
her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you near enough when you engaged the single
Ship? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> ever to leeward of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she ever right a-head of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, rather upon our Weather-Bow, if any thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you haul'd off from the four of the Enemy's
Ships, did you hail the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We did hail her, but I can't be certain whether it was
after we had done engaging the first Ship, or after engaging
the four Ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever observe the <font>Spanish</font> Ships to         
shorten Sail,
or alter their Course from your first engaging them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>James Patterson</font> , Master's Mate of the <font>Royal-Oak</font> , was
called in and sworn. His Deposition read, setting forth,
that he was Master's Mate of the <font>Royal-Oak</font> on the
11th of <font>February</font> 1743; that about one, the Admiral
and <font>Marlbro'</font> bore down and engaged the Enemy; and
that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal-Oak</font> bore down
also, but not so near as the Admiral and <font>Marlbro'</font> did,
and that they might have gone nearer, having Wind
sufficient. That the <font>Marlbro'</font> was disabled, having her
Main and Mizen-Masts shot away, and the <font>Namur</font> was
then engaged in Fight, and the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and
<pagebreak id="65" />
<font>Royal-Oak</font> were then to windward, and might have
assisted the <font>Marlbro'</font> , but did not; that between three
and four, the <font>Ann Galley</font> Fireship bore down upon the
Enemy, but she was not covered or conducted by any
of the other Ships, and that the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and
<font>Royal-Oak</font> , might have covered her, but none of them
did.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you        
quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Fore-castle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know concerning the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Admiral bore down we bore down, but the
Admiral took a shorter round than we did, and when we
brought to first, the <font>Rupert</font> was to windward of us, and she
brought-to before we did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you engage a single Ship at first? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what time did you begin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't remember the time of the Day, it was about
half an hour after the Admiral began.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon our Larboard-Bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what distance from you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Cable's Length.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she engage that Ship too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not immediately, she fired some time after we did, but
can't say at what Ship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Rupert</font> when you had done engaging
the single Ship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon our Larboard-Bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pretty near us, we hauled up, and came close to her
Quarter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you hail the <font>Rupert</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say positively, whether it was before or    
after
we bore down the last time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you lye there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did the <font>Rupert</font> do afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She did not bear down with us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What past in your hailing the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our Captain hailed several times, then Captain       
<font>Ambrose</font>
came into his Starboard-Gallery; our Captain asked why
they did not bear down nearer? Captain <font>Ambrose</font> turn'd round,
but said nothing that I heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think that Captain <font>Ambrose</font> was then within
Gun-shot of the Enemy?
<pagebreak id="66" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within random Shot he might.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Repeat the Words that past on your hailing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When our Captain hailed, Captain <font>Ambrose</font> came into
his Starboard-Gallery, he said, what do you say? Captain
<font>Williams</font> said, Why don't you edge nearer, Captain <font>Ambrose</font> ?
or Words to that effect. Captain <font>Ambrose</font> turn'd round, and
went out of his Gallery into his Cabin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you hailed the <font>Rupert</font> did she bear down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear Captain <font>Ambrose's</font> Words distinctly, 
What
do you say, Captain <font>Williams</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you were engaging the four Ships, was Captain
<font>Ambrose</font> within a proper Distance of the Enemy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or was he at any part of the Time during the
Engagement within Point-blank? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After you hailed the <font>Rupert</font> , did the            
<font>Royal-Oak</font> bear
down singly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell whether it was after or before hailing, 
that
we bore down singly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you ever hail'd by Captain <font>Ambrose</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not that I ever heard of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must you have heard it, if he had hailed you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I was upon the Fore-castle all Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> within Point-blank, or in a Line  
with
the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlbro'</font> , when she fired? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which of the four Sail of the Enemy were you engaged
with the last time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most of the four.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far did the Headmost shoot a-head of you, before
the Admiral made the Signal to leave off Chace and wore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember whether she was before our Beam or
not; if she was before our Beam, it was as much as she
was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Sail did they come up with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Top-gallant-sails, Top-sails, and Fore-sails; some had
their Top-gallant-sails down, and some not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they shorten Sail, or alter their Course upon your
firing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember they did, they edged away a little
more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it from your fire? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the <font>Rupert</font> from you then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To windward of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was she doing?
<pagebreak id="67" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far to windward of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Cable's length upon our Bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Rupert</font> fire then?                
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Ship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she wide upon your Bow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Point and a Half or two Points upon our weather
Bow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> ever within Point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe not till we wore in the Evening.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship go down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which was nearest the Fireship, the five Sail of the
Enemy, or the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Rupert</font> was the nearest when the Fireship was
coming down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which was the nearest when she blew up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Spanish</font> Ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which of our Ships was the nearest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did the Fireship bear from you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon our Starboard-bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did the Fireship bear from the <font>Spanish</font> Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The headmost of them was abaft her Beam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Marlborough</font> when she lost her    
Masts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Rupert</font> assist her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you engaged  
the four
Ships, how were they from you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The two sternmost upon our Quarter, and the two
headmost upon our Beam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did these Ships come up, with the Wind
large?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two or three Points from the Wind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How cou'd I have engaged those Ships till they came
a-head of the <font>Royal Oak</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You cou'd not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were those Ships in a Line with their Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Them seem'd to come up to close the Line with their
Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they in a Line with their Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Admiral was further to windward than they.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they come up as you did?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They edg'd away more than we did.
<pagebreak id="68" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Captain <font>Williams</font> and I had bore away further  
than
we did, before we brought up, wou'd not those Ships have shot
us away to leeward of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had we gone down as close as the Admiral and         
<font>Marlbro'</font>
did, if those Ships had had a Mind, some, if not all of them
might have weatherd us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did the Single Ship go to that you engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is very odd, if you engaged a Ship an Hour, that  
you
don't know where she went to; pray recollect your-self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know there was a Single Ship distant from the four
which we engaged.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did I engage as soon as I had any Ship to engage
with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember what Ship you engaged with, I saw
you fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see me haul off from the Enemy or
endeavour to get nearer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw you endeavour to get nearer from your    
first
hauling up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did I haul off?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seem'd to keep the same Position.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the Shot that you receiv'd in your Main
Mast, was it the Aftermost part or one Side?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Between the two Cheeks in the Aftermost part.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not that Shot come from the Ship a-stern of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was either from the sternmost of the Enemy, or that
next to her as I believe, I am not positive.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How cou'd I get between them to fire upon them till
they got out of the Way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know whether we did not receive that Shot in
the hauling off, we might receive it then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon your hauling off did you get your Fore-Tack on
board, haul your Mizen out, and haul your Wind till you
got to windward of my weather Beam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember we got our Weather-Tack aboard
till we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see me yaw Ship, put my Sails a-back
in order to open the Enemy's Ships, and bring my weather
Guns to bear?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw you once bring to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did I ever fire my weather Guns?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say you did.
<pagebreak id="69" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see me yaw Ship, put the Helm
sometime Port, sometime Starboard, and lay my Sails back?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not observe you did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you fire before I began?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some time; I can't remember how long.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As these Ships were under their Topsails, Topgallant
sails and Foresails, they must have soon pass'd you; did I not
engage them then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say; the headmost just came before our Beam, I
saw her firing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any of her Shot fall short?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and several of your Shot fell short of her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was I from the Enemy when you saw me
fire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Less than a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was I within a Cable's Length of you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal Oak</font> in a Line with  
the
Fireship when she blew up? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the Fireship to Leeward of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About half a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any of the sternmost Ships of the Enemy ever pass
the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I saw none pass till we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What side of the Deck did  
Captain
<font>Williams</font> stand on when he hail'd the <font>Rupert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Weather side of the Quarter-Deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Captain <font>Philip Toms</font> , late of the <font>Norfolk</font> , call'd 
in,
and sworn, and his Deposition read, setting forth, that he
was second Lieutenant of the <font>Norfolk</font> on the 11th of
<font>February</font> 1743, that about eleven the Signal was made to
engage; that about half past twelve the Admiral and 
<font>Marlbro'</font> began to fire upon the Enemy; that all the Captains
a-stern of the <font>Marlbro'</font> were in Sight of the Signal to
engage, and of the Engagement; that the Fireship bore down
near the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and the <font>Royal Oak</font> , that 
she
was not cover'd or conducted by any of the other Ships,
and that those three Ships might have cover'd her, but
neither of them did, and she blew up without Effect.
   Then the Court desired him to relate what he knew
concerning the <font>Rupert</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Witness.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All I know of her is, that the three Ships     
a-stern
of the <font>Marlbro'</font> made an Angle to windward of the
Line, the <font>Dorsetshire</font> was the leewardmost, the <font>Essex</font>
to windward of her, the <font>Rupert</font> to leeward of the
<font>Essex</font> ; I did not see them till after two, when the
<pagebreak id="70" />
<font>Marlboro'</font> was out of Action; I did not see any thing
more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the             
<font>Royal Oak</font> engaged,
how did the <font>Rupert</font> bear from her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Marlborough</font> when her Masts fell?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Rupert</font> , or any of the other     
Ships a-stern, 
assist her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they all then made the Angle, and were in the
Position I mentioned.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they firing then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw them firing once, but can't tell whether it was
then or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Fireship go down? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see her blow up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, but I saw her Combustibles in the Air.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any of those Ships go down with her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see any of them go down with her, but they
went down after her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long after her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Admiral was wearing then, and they all bore down
with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw the <font>Royal Oak</font> to leeward of the other
Ships, was the <font>Rupert</font> disabled, or what was the Reason she
did not bear down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say what might be the Reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there Wind enough? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the <font>Royal Oak</font> was engaging the second Ship
a-stern of the <font>Spanish</font> Admiral, where were the other <font>Spanish</font>
Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A long Way a-stern, and to Windward of every
Ship of Admiral <font>Mathews's</font> Division.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure of that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it is plain they were to Windward, because
I was to Leeward of the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Essex</font> , <font>Rupert</font> and 
<font>Royal Oak</font> , and I saw those Ships to Windward of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>A.</font> </comment> At what time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At two, and half past two, and at three: Admiral
<font>Lestock's</font> Division engaged them to windward of our Line at
three, and when Mr. <font>Lestock's</font> Division neared them, they
edged away towards their Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr. <font>Lestock's</font> Division to windward of the
Admiral's? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
