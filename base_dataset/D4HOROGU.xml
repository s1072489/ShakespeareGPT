</dialogue> <head>A DIALOGUE BETWIXT MR. <font>STATE ROGUE</font> ,
A PARLIAMENT-MAN, AND HIS OLD
ACQUAINTANCE MR. <font>JOHN UNDERTAKER</font> .</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>State Rogue.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What moody, musing <font>Jack</font> , winding up
thy Politicks? Come prethee what
project on Foot now? For I know thou
art a Man of Projects.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Undertaker.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O my dear <font>State Rogue</font> ! why 'faith 
I'm
just now going to your House at <font>Westminster</font> , that Famous
Nursery of your Name and Family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What to the Parliament House? Prethee what Business
hast thou there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, to tell you the Truth, I'm going to try what I
can do in order to stem that Tide of Blood that runs with such
a mighty Torrent from the Veins of my distressed dear
Country-men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What some Project of Peace on foot, <font>Jack</font> ?    
'Tis so
upon my Life, and the Grand <font>Lewis</font> has made thee Mediator.
Well, thou'rt a rare Fellow; a most excellent Undertaker. I
see thou hast not thy Name for nothing, no more than I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No 'faith, he has not employ'd me; nor am I
going about his Business, but my own, and my Countries.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As what prethee?
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why look you, I intend to propose it to the House,
the carrying on a vigorous War against <font>France</font> , or carrying on
the War against <font>France</font> with vigour; take it which way you
will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very pretty Proposal. Why this has been proposed,
and resolved on, Seven years agon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why ay this is true; but you see, and we all see, 
that
here is nothing come of it. Therefore I intend to undertake
the Business my self, my dear <font>State Rogue</font> : And first, I'll know
of our wise Senate how many Millions <font>per An.</font> they will give
me to do it; and how many Years they are willing to allow
me to humble this great and mighty Monarch of <font>France</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, and what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then, for Six Millions <font>per An.</font> and Seven  
Years
to effect it, I'll undertake the Business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What alone, and without an Army?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay, alone; and without an Army. Give me
but Money enough, and let me alone for Undertaking?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As how prethee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why thus, do you mark me? Look you, as soon as
I have got the Money, away go I into <font>Flanders</font> , live great,
spend the Money, no matter how; look on peaceably, and
be a Witness of the King of <font>France's</font> taking several of our strong
Towns; and when the <font>French</font> Army have done the Business,
they cut out for that Campaign, and are gon to their Winter
Quarters, away come I home again; tell the Parliament what
noble Feats I have done, ask them for another Six Millions,
return to <font>Flanders</font> again the next Season, and do just as I did
before; and so go on till the Seven years are expired: And if
this won't reduce <font>France</font> , and save the Lives and Reputation
of our brave <font>English</font> Boys, the Devil is in't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha, by my troth thou makest me laugh; a
most incomparable Project! O rare Mr. <font>Undertaker</font> ! But
thou'rt not in earnest sure <font>Jack</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in earnest? Yes, in good gerning earnest. Why
prethee <font>State Rogue</font> where is the Difficulty? Is there any        
Difficulty
in my going into <font>Flanders</font> , and back again? Is there any
Difficulty in my standing by, whilst the <font>French</font> take our Towns?  
Is
<pagebreak id="3" />
there any Difficulty in my asking the Parliament Money?
And can there be any Difficulty in my taking the Money, when
they frankly give it me? Where, in the Name of <font>Pharaoh</font> , then
lies the Difficulty of carrying on my Project? Now, Mr. <font>State
Rogue</font> , what occasion have you for laughing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha; Oh I shall die; ha, ha, ha;
Oh I shall kill my self with laughing. Why the Devil's in
thee sure to talk at this rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now can't I, for the Soul of me, understand where
lies this merry Conceit; nor what in the Name of Fate it is
that thou laughest at. I ask thee where's the Difficulty in my
Undertaking, and thou fallest a Laughing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha; why no, my noble <font>Undertaker</font> ,     
here's no
great Difficulty in thy going into <font>Flanders</font> , and back again,    
<font>&amp;c.</font>
But the Difficulty remains Man still of conquering <font>France</font> . And
the Difficulty is, That the Parliament should be such a Pack
of Fools, and Asses, as to give thee such a Mass of Treasure as
thou hast projected, to the impoverishing and sinking the
Nation, to carry on a Project that has neither Head nor Tail;
to carry on a vigorous War with <font>France</font> , and here's no War
commenced, nor like to be, according to thy Project.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shaw, shaw, you talk like an Apothecary. Why is
it not the same Thing for the Parliament to give me the
Millions for looking on, and seeing our Towns taken, as to give 
it to a <font>Dutch</font> Man, who takes with him a mighty Army, and
does no more with it than I do alone? Nay, don't I deserve
it infinitely better? For do I hazard any one but my self, and
that not much you see? Do I harrass a Hundred thousand
Men off their Legs, one Year after another, to as little
purpose as to set our Dogs to bark against the Moon? Do I let
Men die like Dogs in Ditches, and starve them for want of
Bread? Do I lead on an Army to Face the Enemy, cry holoo,
set them on, and then run away, and leave them to be 
sacrificed? Where's the Wonderment then in giving me these mighty
Sums, who am an honest <font>English</font> Man, for doing alone better
Service than the <font>Dutch</font> Man, and all his Army? Why don't
I maintain the Honour and Reputation of our Country, and
Country-men, infinitely better than he? For I'm resolved
<pagebreak id="4" />
never to put it to the hazard of a Battle, or being shamefully
beaten, when I know we must be beaten so often as we fight.
What think you, Mr. <font>State Rogue</font> , I think the Case is plain
and clear: And yet if the Parliament gives me these
formidable Sums presently, they are a Pack of Fools, and Asses.
But to give it to this <font>Dutch</font> Man, who has no more Right or
Title to it than I have, they are a wise Senate. Prethee
shew me the Wisdom for the one, and the Folly for the other,
and now you had best laugh again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Life I begin to think thou'rt in earnest
indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why have I not Reason to be so? I don't see but
the Project may take. I have as much Money as he 'tis true,
but still I save the Men. And if the Parliament is so prodigal
of their Countries Money, as to throw it away to no purpose,
may it not as well, nay better, be given to an honest <font>English</font>
Man, as well as to a <font>Dutch</font> Man? Besides, I could find ways
to spend the Money at home, and so let it circulate, and not
impoverish the Nation. And is not this better than the <font>Dutch</font>
Man's sending it abroad to be circumcised, and so sent home
to us again to set us all together by th'Ears?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come <font>Jack</font> , prethee leave off this            
Boffoonery, and
be serious. What, in the Name of <font>Pharaoh</font> , should make thee
imagine that the Parliament should give thee such vast Sums
of Money for no Service; only for looking on, and seeing the
<font>French</font> conquer, and take our Towns?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what, in the Name of <font>Jupiter</font> , should     
make thee
approve of their actually giving it to a <font>Dutch</font> Man, for the
very same Non-service?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prethee has not this <font>Dutch</font> Man (as thou callest
him) a formidable Army at his Command, to oppose the
Growth and Greatness of the Power of <font>France</font> , to hinder
them from making any further Progress in their Conquests,
and to carry on the War with vigour against them?

<pagebreak id="5" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay, <font>Jack</font> ; and let the Nation Squeek and  
Groan
on; so long as we Laugh, the Care is taken. Prethee who
may they thank for their Squeeking and Groaning but
themselves? Was not almost the whole Nation mad for a <font>Dutch</font>
King, and a War with <font>France</font> ? And now they have them,
they are sick of them; but so long as we the Representatives
are Gainers by it; so long as the <font>Dutch</font> Stadtholder is kind to
<pagebreak id="6" />
us, and feeds us plentifully with Money, let them be sick,
and dye, and be damn'd; we matter it not, for we are
resolved to give him Money still. Look you, <font>Jack</font> , you know
one good Turn deserves another: And so long as our K.
<font>William</font> is kind to us, why should not we be kind to him?
Especially when we can do it at so cheap a Rate, as the picking
one Pocket to fill another: 'Tis but robbing <font>Peter</font> to pay
<font>Paul</font> : And so long as the <font>Dutch</font> King feeds us <font>English</font> Men
with good <font>English</font> Gold, he shall never want it old Boy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O most incomparable Patriots! <font>English</font> Men,
<font>English</font> Devils rather, Pick pockets, Betrayers of your Country,
Hang-men of your Fellow Subjects and Country-men, the
Peoples Scourge and Plague; have we entrusted you with our
All to do us Justice, and to redress our Grievances, and ye
make it your Business to undo us, to rob us, to enslave us?
Ye have already beggar'd the Nation; and what is the
Consequence of Beggary but Slavery? And thus ye go on in your
Villany, and laugh at us. 'Tis but robbing <font>Peter</font> , ye cry, to
pay <font>Paul</font> : But when <font>Peter</font> has no more Money, how, in the
Devil's Name, will ye pay <font>Paul</font> ? And 'tis almost come to that
already. But I suppose when <font>Peter</font> has no more Money, he
is to be stript, sold, and sent a Slave to <font>Amboyna</font> , or some of
the <font>Dutch</font> Plantations, to make room for them to Lord it here.
Ye Crocadiles! Ye brood of Vipers! O if it was but Lawful,
with what pleasure I could curse ye! O <font>England</font> ! unhappy
<font>England</font> ! betray'd by thy own Children! What is there never
an <font>English Massianello</font> that has the Courage to run through the
Streets of <font>London</font> , and cry out to the People, We are betray'd?
No true <font>English</font> Man that dare stand up for Liberty and
Property?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why how now, <font>Jack</font> , thou'rt Angry.
<comment type="compiler">UNDERTAKER'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think thou art a rare Fellow at Projects: But   
this
wont do by any means. This will never take in the House;
for what shall we get by it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Get by it, what do you mean? If we don't get, at
least we shall save.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As what prethee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why we shall save many a sound Drubbing, we shall
save our Bones whole in our Skins, we shall save spilling our
Blood, we shall save Three Millions of Money yearly; and I
think this saving is a kind of getting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Poh; all this is nothing, thou mistakest me. I say,
what shall we the Representatives in Parliament get? What is
it to us who Loseth, so long as we are Gainers? For 'tis not
the Nations Business that we are concerned for now, but our
own proper Interest. Will the <font>French</font> King bribe us, as does
K. <font>William</font> ? Will he make us his Pentioners, and will he be
more generous to us than K. <font>William</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He will upon my Life; provided ye prove as great
Rogues to King <font>William</font> , as ye did to his Father. Betray him
as ye did his Father, kick him out of the Kingdom, and then
<pagebreak id="8" />
swear he has abdicated, and then vote your selves all Kings:
And I'm sure all honest thinking Men will believe ye as good
Kings as the <font>Dutch</font> Stadtholder. Do this, I say, and the King
of <font>France</font> will give ye any Thing: Nay, I dare engage ye
Three Millions <font>per Ann.</font> shall all be at your Service.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why 'faith, <font>Jack</font> , set this Project on foot,  
and I
fancy it may take. Make us but sure of larger Bribes from
the <font>French</font> King, and I'll engage for my Brother Rogues he
shall have the Money. Why prethee Self-interest is our God,
and Religion: And as we have for this betray'd our King
and Country <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: County</comment> ; where is the Difficulty, for a 
greater Interest,
of playing the same Trick over again, and leaving the Prince
of <font>Orange</font> in the Lurch, and becoming Friends to <font>France</font> ?
Look you, <font>Jack</font> , that you may not doubt of Success in this
Affair; be assured 'tis our Principle, to sacrifice Father,
Brother, King, any Thing for Interest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear <font>State Rogue</font> , I'm satisfied it is so.    
Well, I'll to
the House, and propose the Project there; you assure me it
will take? And then for <font>France</font> , and the Business is done.
But hark you, <font>State Rogue</font> , you'll make your Interest in the
House, and I will secure you out of the Three Millions: Let
me see, -- Let me see, -- Five hundred Guineas for a
Bribe. Be sure you lay before your Brother Rogues a Mass
of Money, a Million at least of the Three shall be distributed
amongst them, as a yearly Pention, to encourage them in
their Roguery, and make them a Pack of thorough paced
Villains; for those you know are the Men of Honour, the
Men of Worship, in little <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fear not, <font>Jack</font> ; if thou canst manage the     
Project
right with Grand <font>Lewis</font> , and secure us the Money, the
Business will most assuredly be done: <omission type="sentence" /> 
<comment type="compiler">THE REST OF STATE ROGUE'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fear not, it shall be done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But stay, now I think on't, what art thou,        
<font>Jack</font> , to
get by this Project, in case it succeed? We you know are to
give out of the Peoples Money Three Millions <font>per Ann.</font> that
the <font>French</font> King will be quiet, and keep within his Lines; and
for this doing, the great Monarch is to give us the
Representatives in Parliament, One Million back again. Good: This
is just as we do with the Prince of <font>O.</font> He puts the Question,
<pagebreak id="10" />
Will we pick the Pockets of our Fellow Subjects every Year,
and give him out of them Six Millions <font>per An.</font> to carry on a
vigorous War with <font>France</font> ? And our Answer was, Give us
500000 <font>l.</font> for every such Sum, and the Business shall be done,
as you see effectually it is. Now if <font>France</font> will be contented
with half the Sum, and redouble upon us what <font>Will. O.</font> gave
us, I see no difficulty in the Business: For this way we shall
get more, and oppress the People less. But then what will
my honest <font>Undertaker</font> get by the Project?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. U.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Honour to do my Country Service, the
Reputation of a true honest <font>English</font> Man, and Lover of his
Country, nothing else. And this I value more than all your sordid
Gold, that ye have unjustly and barbarously squeezed from the
Sweat and Blood of your Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then, my true honest <font>English</font> Man, farewel:
And may'st thou grow fat with Honour and Honesty, whilst
we Knaves wallow in Gold, and rowl in Plenty. And so I
leave thee to think and wish for better Times: Ha, ha, ha.
