<nonSpeech> <foreign>In primis</foreign> , this examinate saith and
confesseth, that she hath knowledge and can
doo the most detestable Arte of
Witchecraft, and that she learned this her
knowledge in the same, of one mother Humfrye
of <font>Maplested</font> , who told her that she must kneele down
vpon her knees, and make a Circle on the ground, and
pray vnto Sathan the cheefe of the Deuills, the forme
of which praier that she then taught her, this
examinate hath now forgotten, and that then the Spirits
would come vnto her, the which she put in practise
about twenty yeeres since, in the feelde of <font>Iohn
Wiseman</font> of <font>Stysted</font> Gentleman, called Cowfenne feelde,
and there making a Circle as she was taught, and
kneeling on her knees, said the praier now forgotten,
and inuocating vpon Sathan: Two Sprites did
appeere vnto her within the said Circle, in the similitude
and likenes of two black frogges, and there
demaunded of her what she would haue, beeing readye to doo
for her what she would desire, so y=t= she would promise
to giue them her soule for their trauaile, for otherwise:
they would doo nothing for her. Wher-upon she did
promise them her soule, and then they concluded with
her so to doo for her, what she would require, and gaue
the~selues seuerall names, that is to say, the one Jack,
and y=e= other Jyll, by the which names she did alwaies
after call them. And then taking them vp, she caried
<pagebreak id="A3V" />
them home in her lap and put them in a Box and gaue
them white bread and milke.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And within one moneth after she sent them to milke
Hurrelles Beastes, which they did, and they would
bring milke for their owne eating and not for her.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further, she saith that her sprites neuer
changed their colour since they first came vnto her, and that
they would familiarly talke with her, when she had
any thing to say or doo with them in her owne
language.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And like wise she confesseth that she sent her saide
spirits to hurt the wife of John Sparrow the elder,
of <font>Stysted</font> , which they did, and also that where
Maister John Glascock of <font>Stysted</font> , aforesaide: had a great
stack of Logges in his yarde, she by her said Spirits
did ouerthrowe them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further, saith that she hath hurt diuers persons
within this sixteene or twenty yeeres, but how many
she now knoweth not.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Furthermore, she confesseth that she sent her sprites

to hurt Maister Kitchin Minister of the saide towne,
and also vnto one George Coe of the saide towne,
shoomaker, to hurt him likewise: but they could not, and
the cause why they could not, as the saide sprites tolde
her, was because they had at their comming a strong
faith in God, and had inuocated and called vpon him,
that they could doo them no harme.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further she saith, that Margaret Cunny her
Daughter, did fall out with Father Hurrill, and gaue
<pagebreak id="A4R" />

sent her spirits to her.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Also she dooth vtterlye <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: vtterie</comment> denye that     
she sent her saide
spirits to Finches wife, Deuenishes wife, and Renold
Ferror or any of them to hurt them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And beeing further examined, she confesseth that
although her said spirits at some time can haue no
power to hurt men, yet they may haue power to hurt their
Cattell.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Joane Cunny, liuing very lewdly, hauing two
lewde Daughters, no better then naughty packs, had
two Bastard Children: beeing both boyes, these two

she going to <font>Braintye</font> Market, came to one Harry

busie and a brewing, tolde her she had no leysure to giue
her any. Then Joane Cunnye went away 
discontented: and at night Finches wife was greeuously taken
in her head, and the next day in her side, and so
continued in most horrible paine for the space of a week, and
then dyed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mother Cunnye confessed that she sent her spirite
Jill to torment her.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The same boy confessed that he was commaunded
by his Grandmother to fetch a burden of wood, which
he gathered, but another boye stole it from him, and
he came home without: and tolde his Grandam: and

Huddlestones ground beeing high Sheriffe of the Sheere,
and to take with him Jack the sprite, and so he did,

setling his fiery eyes vpon her
eyes, spake and pronounced
vnto her these woords
following, namelye:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Joan Prentice
giue me thy soule, </dialogue><nonSpeech>to whome
this Examinate being greatly
amazed, answered and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> In
the name of god what art thou
</dialogue><nonSpeech>The Ferrit answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am
satan, feare me not my comming vnto thee is to doo thee
no hurt but to obtaine thy soule, which I must and wil
haue before I departe from thee </dialogue><nonSpeech>to whome the saide
examinate answered and said, that he demaunded that
of her which is none of hers to giue, saying: that her
soule appertained onely vnto Jesus Christ, by whose
precious blood shedding, it was bought and
purchased. To whome the saide Ferret replyed and saide,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I
must then haue some of thy blood, </dialogue><nonSpeech>which she willingly
graunting, offered him the forefinger of her left hand,
the which the Ferrit tooke into his mouth, and
setting his former feete vpon that hand, suckt blood
therout, in so much that her finger did smart exceedingye:
and the saide examinate demaunding againe of the
Ferrit what his name was: It answered Bidd. and
then presently the said Ferrit vanished out of her sight
sodainly.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
   <nonSpeech>Item, the saide examinate saith further, that about
one moneth after, the saide Ferrit came againe vnto
her in the night time as she was sitting vpon a little
stoole, preparing her selfe to bed-ward, as is aboue
saide:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ioan wilt thou goe to bed, </dialogue><nonSpeech>to whome she
answered</nonSpeech><dialogue> yea that I will by Gods grace, </dialogue><nonSpeech>then presently
the Ferret leapt vp vpon her lap, and from thence vp
to her bosome, and laying his former feete vpon her
lefte shoulder, sucked blood out of her lefte cheeke, and
then he saide vnto her,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ioan if thou will haue me doo
any thing for thee, I am and wilbe alwaies ready at
thy commaundement, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and ther-upon she beeing a
little before fallen out with William Adams his wife of
<font>Hinningham Sibble</font> aforesaide: willed the Ferret to
spoile her drinke which was then in brewing, which
he did accordingly.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Item, the saide examinate furthermore saith and

appeered vnto her alwaies at the time when she was going
to bed, and the last time he appeered vnto her was
about seauen weekes last past, at which time she going

sucked blood out of her lefte cheeke, and that doone: he
demaunded of her what she had for him to doo? To who~
she answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> goe vnto Maister Glascocks house, and
nippe one of his Children a little, named Sara, but
hurt it not, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and the next night he resorted vnto her
againe, and told her that he had doon as she willed him:
namely, that he had nipt Sara Glascock, and that she
should dye therof, to whome she answered and saide,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
thou villaine what hast thou doon, I bid thee to nip it
but a little and not to hurt it, and hast thou killed the
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
childe? </dialogue><nonSpeech>which speech beeing vttered, the Ferrit
vanished away suddenly, and neuer came to her sithence.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Item, she affirmeth, that the occasion why she did
will her Ferret to nippe the saide childe, was for that
she beeing the daye before at the house of the saide
Maister Glascok, to begge his almes, answere was
made to her by one of his maiden seruantes, that both
her Maister and Mistres were from home, and
therfore desired her to be contented for that time, and
therupon the examinate departed greatlye discontented,
and that night sent her Ferret to nip the childe as is
aboue saide.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Item, she saith and affirmeth, that at what time
soeuer she would haue her Ferret doo any thing for her,
she vsed these woordes,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Bidd, Bidd, Bidd, come Bidd,
come bidd, come bidd, come suck, come suck, come suck,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and that presently he would appeere as is aforesaide:

perfourmed any mischeefe she willed or wished him to doo for
her vnto or against any of her neighbours.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lastly the said examinate saith, and confesseth, that
one Elizabeth Whale, the wife of Michaell Whale of
Henningham Sibble aforesaide labourer, and 
Elizabeth Mott, the wife of Iohn Mot of the saide Towne
Cobler, are as well acquainted with her Bidd as her
selfe is, but knoweth not what hurt they or any of the~
haue doone to any of their neighbours.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>When their inditements were read, and their
examinations also, they stoode vpon their tearmes,
to prolong life: yet to make the matters more
apparant, sundry witnesses were produced to giue euide~ce
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
against them, and firste the Iudge of the circuite very
wisely with a great foresight, called in the two
Basterd Children beforementioned, and comanded them
greatlye for telling the trueth of that which he should
aske them, concerning their Grandam and their
mothers, which they did, and hauing saide what they
could, together with the depositions of sundrye other
witnesses, they hauing confessed sufficient matter to
proue the inditements. The Iury found these bad 
women guiltie and that they had slaine Men, women,
and Children, And committed very wicked and
horrible actions, diuers and sundrye times, and ther-upon,
the Iudge proceeded, and pronounced the sentence of
death against them, as worthely they had deserued.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>After they had receiued their iudgments, they were
conuayed from the Barre backe againe to Prison,
where they had not stayed aboue two howers, but the
officers prepared them-selues to conduct them to the
place of execution: to which place they led them, and
being come thether, one Maister Ward a learned
deuine, beeing desired by the Iustices, did exhorte these
wicked women to repentance, And perswaded them
that they would shewe vnto the people the trueth of
their wickednes, and to call vpon God for mercy with
penitent hartes. And to aske pardon at his hands for
the same: some fewe prayers they saide after the
precher, but little els: more then this, that they had
deserued to dye, in committing those wicked sinnes: and so
tooke their deathes patiently.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Note</font> , that Mother Vpney being inwardlye pricked
and hauing some inward feeling in conscience cryed
out saying: that she had greeuously sinned, that the
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
deuill had deceiued her, the deuill had deceiued her, and
that she had twice giuen her soule to the Deuill, yet by
the meanes of Gods spirite woorking in her, and the
paines which Maister ward tooke with her, she
seemed very sorry for y=e= same, and died very
penitent, asking God &amp; the world
forgiuenes, euen to y=e= last gaspe,
for her wicked and
detestable life.</nonSpeech>
