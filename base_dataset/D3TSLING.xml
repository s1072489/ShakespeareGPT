<comment type="compiler">INTRODUCTION AND READING OF THE CHARGE OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="A2R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou here standest charged for          
High-Treason; This Court
requires that thou give a positive answer, whether guilty or not     
guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Slingsby.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I desire to have Counsel assigned me.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is matter of Fact laid to your charge,    
which amounts to
Treason, and there is no Law allowed in matters of Fact.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>There is also matter of Law; and I desire   
to be tryed by a Jury, which
is according to the Law of the Land.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are all here your Jury as well as your       
Judges; we are the
number of two or three Juries, and your Jury is well known, for they 
are
chosen by the Parliament; you are to plead to your Indictment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I desire to know whether there can be any   
conviction, unless it be by
confession?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had looked upon the Act of Parliament,   
that would have
told you; it speaks of examination of witnesses, it speaks of your   
confession,
and answer, and of your Default; and if you do not plead to it, will 
be very
penal to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>If it be by the Laws of the Land, that the  
Trial should be by a Jury;
I desire I may have that priviledge.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Acts of Parliament make Justice and Law, they   
are both; they
think fit to change the custom of Trials that have been in former    
times, and
all persons must submit to it: And the Parliament hath thought fit   
to make this
Court both Jury and Judges; and therefore I require that you answer,
whether Guilty or not Guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I desire that the Act of Parliament may be  
read.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are before your Jury and Judges;            
Parliaments have great care
of the Rights of the people, and have appointed this Court, and His  
Highness
hath appointed you to be tried by us, you ought therefore to plead   
to your
Indictment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>The Law gives liberty in case of Juries to  
the Party accused, to make
his Exceptions against the Jury, which he cannot do here, where you  
are both Judge
and Jury.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you have any particular Exception to any     
man, you may make
it; you were Sir of the Parliament, when this Act was made
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I was a Prisoner at the same time.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Although a Prisoner, yet you are bound by Act   
of Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Phelps, Clerk</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have heard your Charge read, and    
Plea demanded;
the Court again requires of you, that you give a positive Answer,    
whether
Guilty or not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am (my Lord) of an opinion, (though you   
may account it a Paradox)
that I cannot trespass against your Laws, because I did not submit   
to them</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All the People of <font>England</font> must submit to    
the Laws of <font>England</font> , to
the Authorities of <font>England</font> , all must submit to my Lord          
Protector and Acts of
<pagebreak id="A2V" />
Parliament: We sit here by Authority of his Highness, by a           
Commission under
the great Seal of <font>England</font> , and by Authority of Parliament, and  
you must
submit to our Authority.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>The Laws have been so uncertain with me,    
that I could not well know
them, and when I was a Prisoner I could not take notice of them, I   
could have no
benefit by your Laws, because that is no Law to me which doth not    
give me interest
and property to what I have; It is the benefit of Laws, that they do 
distinguish
between</font> <foreign>meum</foreign> <font>and</font> <foreign>tuum</foreign> ; <font>but when you take all from   
me, in my case it is not so</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr Attor. Gen. <font>Prideaux.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He may enjoy as much benefit by 
the Laws as any,
if he have not forfeited it, and I desire he may be put to answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Court again require you to plead to you     
Indictment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Not Guilty.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Phelps.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Plea then is, that you are not Guilty.   
</dialogue><nonSpeech>To which, Sir <font>H. S.</font>
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Wat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never visited him but by Col <font>Smiths</font>       
Commission. Sir <font>H Slingsby</font>

burned it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Henry</font> , was it you that filled up

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If <font>Sir H.</font> hath any thing to object, he  
may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I see that I am trepan'd by these two fellows;   
They have said that
serously against me which was spoken in mirth between us; I never    
sought to them,
but they to me, the Commission was procured by no intercourse with   
any persons
beyond the Seas, but a blank which I had for four years together.    
Nor had I any
correspondence beyond Sea to carry on any design here.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lieutenant George Thomson</font> sworn.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>Being asked what Officer he was, he answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a Lieutenant  
to Major
<font>Waterhouse</font> , I was desired to go and see <font>Sir H Slingsby</font> 16   
<font>April</font> , who told me
That he had great confidence in me, I said to him, why? He told me he
thought I had good thoughts of the King; his Son told me he heard    
the King
was to come in, and to bring in a considerable Army, but knew not    
when. Next
day I went again to Sir <font>H.</font> and asked him if he would walk on the 
Leads,
which he did, and there I told him I had been pondering on the words 
he last
spoke to me, who then hugging me said, I have a great deal of        
confidence in
you, there is a design in agitation to bring in the King with a      
considerable
Army, but he did not know how soon it would be, but told me I should 
have
notice of it, and said that the King had promised pardon to all      
Officers but the
Lord Protector and Lord <font>Bradshaw</font> .
<pagebreak id="A4V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir H Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I confess such like discourses; but</font> -- 
Waterhouse <font>spoke to me that I would speak to</font> Thomson <font>to try    
whether he would
be assistant, but I told him I would not, least he should not accept 
it, and then turn
him out of his place</font> . Waterhouse <font>pressed me to go to</font> Thomson, 
<font>and M</font> 
Waterhouse <font>invited us to his house to Dinner, after Dinner he      
spoke to</font> Thomson <font>to go
with me on the Leads to shew me the Guns, we walked about, and came  
down again,
then said</font> Waterhouse <font>to me, did not you speak to</font> Thomson? <font>I  
said not: you had a
good oportunity, said he. At last</font> Thomson <font>came to me, and I had  
some discourse
with him about it</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>H. S.</font> have you any thing else to say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir H. Sl.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>No, my Lord.</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. Mr Serjeant <font>Maynard</font> summed up the Charge, Plea and    
Evidence,
and eloquently set forth the fulness and clearness of the Evidence

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Hewet</font> the Prisoner sitting covered whilest his Impeachment 
was reading, the
Lord President commanded his Hat to be taken off; which the Doctor   
observing
took it off himself. Then Mr. <font>Phelps</font> Clerk to the High Court     
address'd to the
Prisoner to this effect:</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Phelps.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Hewet</font> D. D. Thou standest here      
charged of High Treason:
this Court requires you to give your positive Answer, whether guilty 
or not
guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr Hewet.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, If I have already misbehaved my self     
here, my error is
the more pardonable, because I have not had any Counsel; and I dare  
not presume
to have any knowledge in any faculty, especially in the Law: I never 
did change my
Cassock into a Jump; I am better acquainted with a Pulpit than a     
Bar; better read in
St.</font> Austin <font>than my Lord</font> Coke, <font>and in the</font> Fathers, <font>than</font> 
Rastal's Reports, <font>or</font> Plowden's
Commentaries. <font>In all my life I never studied any Law-case till     
now; that Necessity
that hath no Law hath made me thus far to become a Lawyer, as to     
think to plead (not
for my Livelyhood, but) for my Life. God forgive them that have      
occasioned this
unusual and unaccustomed study, that hath put me into such a Pulpit  
as I never saw
before. And therefore (my Lord) in as much as I have often heard     
that there are
such niceties in the Law that a man may be lost in the severity of   
it for a word spoken
in meer simplicity, I shall crave that there may be nothing taken,   
in prejudice to my
innocency, from words spoken in simplicity: And I hope you will      
please to grant me
that.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dr. <font>Hewet</font> , I am sorry, truly, very    
sorry, to see such an one as you in
that place; but you are impeached of High Treason: All favour will   
be shewn
you according to the rules of Justice. I think you desire Counsel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dr.</font> Hewet.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>No (my Lord) it is first, that I, knowing   
nothing of the Law, may
have nothing (simply spoken) prejudice me: and that you will allow   
me counsel.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Court is Counsel for you, your business  
is to plead to the
Indictment; you are required by the Court to answer whether guilty   
or not
guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, you sit there as Judge, I beseech you to    
let me know by what
Commission you sit there.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dr. <font>Hewet</font> , we sit here by a Commission    
under the Great Seal of
<font>England</font> , in pursuance of an Act of Parliament; that's our       
Commission.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pray give me the favour to have the Commission read, 
my Lord.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> D. <font>H.</font> We know our owne Authority, it is    
not usual to read Commissions
to Prisoners; the Laws of <font>England</font> and Acts of Parliament are to  
be submitted to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am not to own every person that will sit to judge  
me, therefore I desire to
know by what Commission you sit, and who are the Judges, and then I  
shall say
more.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those that are to judge you are very well      
known, you consented your
self to the Judges, we are all chosen by Act of Parliament, the      
Parliament hath
consented to it; we are chosen Judges, and are your Judges by Act of
Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My L. I must know the persons, whether they be all   
here; I see but very few.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here be very many, and we have been all called 
this morning, as the
course is, and we sit now as your Judges.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Under favour, my Lord, as I remember, the Commission 
by the Act is
directed to 150. and there are the Lords Commissioners of the Great  
Seal, with the
Lords of his Highness Treasury, and all the Judges, and divers other 
persons are
named in the Act of Parl. I do not see so many faces as are          
mentioned in that Act.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dr. <font>Hewet</font> , I must tell you the            
<font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> is any seventeen, or more of
them; if we are here seventeen, or more, we are a <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font>   
by that Commission:
We are here I believe forty or fifty.
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, with submission, the case is true, in case  
the Commissioners were
but seventeen, and they all present, then they might hear and        
determine; but if one
were absent, they cannot my Lord as I conceive.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a person of parts, and therefore we    
may delight to hear you,
but we must keep our selves to the business of the Court: You are    
required by the
Court to answer the Impeachment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, if you sit by the Act, sit according to the 
Act, and then I shall
submit. It was resolved by all the Judges of the Kings Bench in the  
13. of</font> Eliz. <font>in
the Earl of</font> Leicester's <font>Case, see</font> Plowden <font>fol. &amp;c.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Doctor did profess his ignorance in   
the Laws, yet pretends
more knowledge than the Court: The Court are here, and know themselves
lawfully authorized to try you. Dr. <font>Hewet</font> , if you please to     
proceed to give your
Answer whether guilty or not, you will find the Justice of the Court 
to be
according to the Laws of <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This learned Gent. I know his face, though not his   
name; he speaks
according to worth, but I cannot answer him according to Law, and    
therefore shall plead
ignorance of the Law, but desire to be tryed according to Law; and I 
have given you a 
Law-president, if you will go against it, I shall say no more.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Gent. hath it by Tradition, not by his 
owne knowledge; but
the Case he mentions cannot parallel this: The Act of Parliament     
saith, an
hundred and fifty, or any seventeen; here are three seventeens.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Ellis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think the Commission is directed to   
your Lordships, or any
seventeen: <font>Which Commissioners, or any seventeen</font> , &amp;c.

several <font> <foreign>Quorums</foreign> </font> for <font>England, Scotland</font> and              
<font>Ireland</font> : 17 for <font>England</font> , 13 for <font>Scotland</font> , &amp;c.
That Case out of <font>Plowden</font> , differs clearly from this: For, if a  
Commission
be directed, and there be no <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> , then the             
Commissioners must all certifie.
We humbly conceive that if your Lordships be here seventeen, or      
more, you are
fully authorized to proceed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In many Cases you have a <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font>   
of persons, such and such men:
It's true, here is no <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> of persons, but a             
<font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> of the number; and if
there be a <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> of seventeen it is warrantable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This learned Gent. he is better able to speak what   
is Law than I; but
under favour, and with submission, I do not think he may judge of    
the Laws, or the
other (that spoke his private conception) to interpret the meaning   
of the Parliament. 
And (my Lord) if your Lordship please, I shall make this my humble   
appeal to the
learned Judges of the Law; That if they will say in this respect     
that this is a lawful
Judicature, I shall proceed.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have heard the words of the Act of         
Parliament read, Authority
is given to the Commissioners, or any seventeen or more of them:     
<font>Which said 
Commissioners respectively</font> ; that is, for <font>England</font> seventeen,   
or more of them; and you
have heard the judgement of the Court upon that. That which you      
speak of in
relation to my Lord of <font>Leicester's</font> Case is true; if a Commission 
be directed to
Commissioners, and no <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> appointed, then all must      
certifie: But by the Act
of Parliament, and the Commission made in pursuance of it, the       
<font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font> is
seventeen: But here are three <font> <foreign>Quorums</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, in asmuch as all the Commissioners are      
named in that Act, and that
Commission is according to the Act, they are all commissionated to   
sit, &amp; unless all sit
the rest cannot try and examine, &amp;c. And I shall refer it to the     
Judges of the Laws.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We did not call our selves to be your Judges,  
by being named your
Judges by Act of Parliament, we have power to declare to you what    
the Law is
by that Act of Parliament, I have declared it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, if the</font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> <font>had been named, then  
it were somewhat: but it being
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
directed to, 17 or more, when more or 17 are Commissionated all must 
sit; I refer it
againe to the Judges of the Laws</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dr. Hewet</font> , what you say now, or what you  
say hereafter besides this,
you have time to speak to, as to matter of Law, after matter of fact 
hath been
tryed; if you plead to matter of fact, what you say to the Court as  
to matter of Law,
we shal be ready to heare it, apply your selfe to the Court in       
matter of fact. The
Court asks you whether guilty or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I must first know whether the Court be a    
lawful Judicature before
I give imy defence.</font> <comment type="compiler"> <font>imy</font> IN SOURCE TEXT.</comment> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dr. Hewet</font> , you have offered very much     
touching the jurisdiction of the
Court, in conclusion you must acquiesce; I must put you up to plead, 
you know the
danger if you doe not plead being required; you stand mute and doe   
not plead, it
is as equally dangerous to you as if you had confessed the crimes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am so highly sensible of the priviledges of an     
Englishman, that both for the
satisfaction of my own conscience, and all persons, that I would not 
willingly give up the
liberties and priviledges of any English freeman to any body that    
demands it; I am very
loth that there should be any just imputation laid upon me, that I   
should seek a disturbance
in point of selfe-interest to divide my selfe from the Communion of  
those that are my
fellow-freemen; and I should, as I have always abhor'd to be both a  
Schismatick from the
Church, and singular from the State. My Lord, I am so concerned for  
the priviledges
of an English freeman, and publick interest, that I should be loth   
to doe any thing towards
the giving them up, that might make my heart ake. I shall desire it  
may be determined by
the Judges.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speak of common friendship; what is      
common friendship, but to be
a friend to the publick Government? if you have been a friend to the
Government and peace of this Nation, you need not fear to plead to   
the Indictment: And
therefore I require you to plead to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. Hewet.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>When ever you shall come to a particular         
Examination of the business,
it will not appear that I have been an Enemy; I desire that whereas  
there are many
niceties in the Laws, I humbly crave the engagement of your Honours, 
that there may
not be any advantage taken.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God forbid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I think I have not spoken any thing         
unreasonably, or against Law,
and therefore humbly crave my former request.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you please, the Dr. knows that there must 
be a Judgment in
which we must acquiesce: This is that Judicature that calls you      
before them; you
sit by the highest Authority of <font>England</font> , an Act of Parliament   
in the first place, a
Commission under the great Seal in the second place, and a           
Commission of his
Highness, against whom, of which the Doctor is one; I desire he may  
give an
Answer to the Impeachment, that being done, we shall have liberty on 
both sides to
speak to what is Justice, and Law, and Fact; if you are not guilty,  
be you assured that
this Court will not take your blood upon them, you have a very fair  
Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This learned person speaks very fairly, It shall be   
far from me to question
any Act of a lawful Parliament; but under favour, as yet it doth not 
appear to me
that you have by that Act by which you sit, power to hear and        
determine concerning the
matters of which I am charged; I referre it, and appeal again and    
again to the learned 
Judges of the Laws, even his Highness Judges.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dr. H.</font> The Court hath had much patience  
in hearing of you thus long,
you having not so much as owned their Authority; if you will not own 
us, we
will own you; therefore I require the Clerk to enter it, that we     
have required
you to plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Phelps Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Hewet</font> , you here stand charged  
of High Treason against his
Highness the Lord Protector, and the Common-wealth; the charge hath  
been read
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
to you, the Court have demanded whether guilty or not guilty, they   
again 
demand of you whether guilty or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>D. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I shall be very loth to do any thing to save 
my life, and forfeit a good
conscience: And I shall not for my private interest give up the      
Privileges of those that
are equal Freemen with my self: I am look'd upon in a double         
Capacity, as a Clergy man,
and as a Common-wealths-man; I should be very loth to be scandalous  
in either: And
pray be pleased to do that justice to your selves as to vindicate    
the legality of your
Judicature, and then I'le proceed.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, you was pleased to tell the Doctor, 
that you will own him
when he doth not own you, but, my Lord, his flying in your faces,    
and taxing you
this is not to be endured; I wish he would have that consideration   
of himself, that
if he doth not own your Authority, you expect to be owned, and by it 
he will be
supposed to be guilty of all those Crimes that are laid to his       
charge, and by not
pleading he doth confess them; that will be an high scandal to Mr.   
Doctor; Therefore
to vindicate your self, I desire you to answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This learned Gent. hath urged it with a great deal   
of civility and respect to
me, which I must own and thankfully acknowledge; but (my Lord)       
withal, I dare not
for the saving of my self give up others, so many thousands of       
others, by my Precedent,
that might likewise be involved in the same condition that I am in;  
therefore (my Lord) let
it appear that it is a lawful Judicature, and I have done.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech Mr. Doctor to consider his case,   
he is not brought as a
Champion for the people of <font>England</font> , as he stands charged he     
appears to you to be
contrary affected; I humbly beg that he would be pleased to plead,   
that so his
innocency may be clear'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I said before that I am no Lawyer, I        
understand nothing of it,
neither desire to be Judge in my own cause; but I do not desire      
likewise to be judged by
every person that would sit to judge me, neither would I give up     
that right that belongs to
an English man to every one that demands it, therefore I desire you  
to grant this
Petition, that you will make appear that you are a lawful            
Judicature. I would rather
die ten thousand times then I will be guilty of giving up my         
fellow-freemens liberties
and priviledges.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, some of his own Coat have           
acknowledged the like
Authority before him; but if Mr. Doctor be peremptory in this that   
he will not own your
Authority, and plead to his charge, I must do my duty, that is,      
humbly to pray the
Court, that if he refuse to answer, I must pray their Judgment, and  
acquaint him
with the words of the Act; </dialogue><nonSpeech>which accordingly was read.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So that,  
my Lord, in
default of Answer, if Mr. Doctor will not plead to this, my Lord I   
must thereupon
pray that you will proceed according to the Act, as in cases of High 
Treason
which is very penal. I have no more to say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I suppose these learned Gent. who are so    
learned in the Laws will be
cautious in what they do against Law, and I hope they will remember  
what
condemnation and execution befell</font> Trecilla <font>in the 11 of</font> Rich.  
2. <font>that there did misadvise the
King to do such and such things, that is much like to this Case of   
mine: And withal I
hope they will remember what befell the Judges in the Case of</font>      
Shipmoney <font>in the time of
the late King, and therefore I hope they will be cautious themselves 
in doing any thing
that is contrary to Law</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dr. H.</font> , you have heard the Clause of the 
Act of Parliament read to you,
whereby you may understand, either we must proceed upon your Answer, 
or else to
Judgment upon your refusal; if upon your answer you clear your       
innocency, then
those freemen that you speak of may faithfully embrace you; but if   
you will not
answer, we must proceed to Judgment; I am sorry for your Robe sake,  
but if you
will not answer, you cannot acquit your self, you thereby confess    
it: therefore
let me advise you for your Robe sake to follow the best Counsel,     
that is, to put your
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
self upon that which Prisoners must do: Answer to it, guilty or not  
guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I hope it is not the sense of the whole     
Court that they should proceed
against me, either to sentence or any other way, till first they     
clear themselves to me.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray who is the Judge? you must clear your   
self to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If there be any here that are of another       
opinion, let him declare
himself: <font>Dr. H.</font> you lose your self mightily in saying this one   
thing so often, and we
lose our time; I require you again to plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I cannot speak of that too often that is so 
dear and precious to me and
every person.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can say no more but pray your justice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doctor <font>Hewet</font> , I am called upon by the   
Court, because of your refusal to
answer, but I pity you very much, and therefore desire once more the 
patience
and favour of the Court, that they would give you leave to answer;   
therefore Mr.
Doctor, that we may not record your standing mute and refusing to    
answer, I shall
once more in favour to you require you to answer. Clerk, stay your   
hand a while.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, both the Court and all these persons will   
thus clear me to the whole
world, that I have referred my self and appealed to his Highness     
Judges of the Law to
resolve whether this be a lawful Judicature; this Appeal is denied,  
therefore I must proceed
to some other thing seeing you all deny me that.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Phelpes Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>J. Hewet D. D.</font> you stand here       
charged on behalf of his
Highness the Lord Protector, of Treason against him and this         
Common-wealth, you have
heard the Charge, the Court hath several times demanded your answer, 
and you
refuse; they the third time require your answer whether guilty or    
not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pray my Lord is there any Indictment found against   
me by a Grand Jury, by
which I am to be tryed? for by the fifth and sixth of</font> Edward <font>the 
sixt, all Treasons are to
be inquired into and presented by twelve men; the Commission by      
which you sit doth not
declare any other way: I beseech you is there any other Indictment</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have a very great Grand Jury, forty        
persons, and we have power upon
a special Act of Parliament to give order for a Charge to be brought 
in against you,
and we have according to that power and Authority given order for    
this Charge to
be brought in against you, and you are to answer to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, with submission you are not a competent     
Jury.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, now it is the second part to 
the same tune; I know
there are many others upon the same string when this is resolved;    
Sir, This is the
Grand Jury, the Petty Jury, and your Judge; they require you to give 
your Answer,
whether guilty or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>D. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, this is likewise denyed me, I now humbly     
crave a copy of my Charge,
time to answer to it, and Counsel assigned me.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the copy of your Charge it was never     
granted to any Prisoner
indicted for High Treason; For Counsel, you are now upon matter of   
Fact,
whether guilty or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have a word to inform him, I would not    
press any thing
against him which in my Judgment I thought not legal, you have given 
him your
resolution as to the Jurisdiction, there is nothing now to say but   
guilty or not
guilty; he must bring himself to be a party or else nothing can be   
asked.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I think the Prisoner cannot be charged and tryed on  
one and the same day, no
more than a man can be endicted and tryed the same day, as in</font>      
Calway's <font>Reports: and
this was declared to be Law in the Case of the</font> Portugal            
<font>Embassador's Brother</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are not upon your Triall, you must plead 
and joyn issue, and then
we will consider whether we will try you now or no; Yet there is     
many a man hath
been brought to prison the same day, found the same day, and tryed   
the same day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I desire a copy of my charge, if not that, I desire  
time to speake, and
Councell assigned me, which hath been the course of former times;    
for Counsell it hath been
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
usually allowed, as in the case of</font> Humphry Stafford <font>in the time  
of</font> Henry <font>the 7. and
in the case of</font> Lilburn. <font>Baron</font> Nicholas, <font>and Serje.</font> Maynard 
<font>were of Counsell for
Major</font> Rolph, <font>who indeavoured to poyson the late King: and for    
matter of Law, it ought
to be allowed, as in my Lord</font> Cook -- <font>and</font> Dyer <font>sixth book of  
his Reports, 14</font> fol. <font>is
of the same opinion</font> : Arundell <font>had Counsel assigned him for      
murder, in matter of
Law</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sol. <font>Ellis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For matter of fact it was never allowed; but 
if he plead, and if any
matter of Law doe arise, that's doubtfull to the Court, then the     
Court if they
doubt of it, assigne Counsell; but the prisoner must plead first to  
the
matter of fact. For a man to be accused the same day, and tryed the  
same day, is no
new thing: For Counsell, if any thing arise in matter of Law then it 
may be
considered: The <font>Portugal</font> Embass. Brother came, and was accused   
and tryed the same day.
We shall humbly pray that he may plead guilty or not guilty; if any  
matter of
Law arise your Lordships may doe him justice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, with submission, this learned Gent. hath    
understood me but in part;
my request was for Counsell for matter of Law in generall, as well   
as particular for
matter of fact. I humbly conceive that there are severall Acts of    
Parliament that doe
free me from this charge, and particularly the great Charter of</font>    
England; <font>for which I
humbly crave I may have Counsell assigned me</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are now in generals, you speak of several  
Acts of Parliament, and you
would have Counsel to plead, Counsel was never allowed in this case  
upon such a
general desire; Many that stand about you may have a prejudice to    
you, and think
you are loth to plead; I have called upon you often: if we should    
once record the
refusall, it would be very penall. I would advise you to plead to    
the Indictment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>D. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, since you have denyed me Counsell, I shall   
desire to speake something
in my own behalfe.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a very ill President to the justice   
of <font>England</font> ; I suppose that you
will allow him all favour, but the justice of <font>England</font> must be    
prefer'd against all 
persons whatsoever: The jurisdiction is setled to the satisfaction   
of the Dr. 
himselfe; if he will bring himselfe a party and aske any thing of    
you, that must be by
pleading, till then he can aske nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, the Judicature is not yet clear'd to me,    
for the legality of it,
and if you please to give a little patience I shall give you the     
reasons why.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall desire it may be no more thus.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall say no more to you, we must make our       
Authority appear to you
either by trying of you, or judging of you; will you be try'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, the Charge depends upon an Act of           
Parliament which was made
about two years since, the Members of which Parliament were chosen   
by the people, yet
notwithstanding one hundred and fifty of them were not permitted to  
sit --</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord we must not suffer this, pray if he  
will not be otherwise satisfied
I must require your strict justice. Your words they are seditious:   
this shews the
spirit of the man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I hope you will have patience to heare me for        
vindication of my selfe,
and satisfaction of my own conscience and all persons whatever; and  
withall, for the
clearing of your selves that you doe not bring blood upon your       
selves by taking that
power that is not justifiable --</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly my Lord this is insufferable; Mr.      
Doctor hath had as much respect
as ever any had. I have attended many, I never saw the like in my    
time; you have
had the patience to heare him oppose your selves, your Authority,    
your persons,
and to strike at the root of all. Mr. Doctor I would have you to     
carry your selfe
with more respect. This shews that much of what is charged against   
him is true: If
you will scorn the Court say it positively.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I humbly submit my selfe to the Laws of the 
Land; I shall not dispute
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
Acts of Parliament, but I conceive (if you will please to give me a  
little patience) an
house of Commons is not of Authority enough </font> -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Doctor pray remember that Text, <font>He that  
seemeth to be Religious and
bridleth not his tongue, his Religion is vain</font> . Will you plead or  
not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, whilst I speak for the Laws of the Land     
this is not an evill speech.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if you please, I did receive your   
comands to prepare this charge
against this Doctor; in obedience to you I have done it, not         
willingly against your
person Mr. Doctor; I have some others to proceed against, if you     
will please that
Mr. Doctor may dispatch one way or other. I must pray your final     
sentence if you
doe not plead immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, what I petitioned for before I doe again,   
that seeing you will not please
to give me leave to speak either as to the priviledges of English    
men, nor as to the Act,
I desire time to speak to the Charge, and Counsell.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have heard that I must require your        
answer; you must plead guilty 
or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hath your Lordship assigned me Counsel in matter of  
fact when matters of
Law arise?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall then take consideration of it, now is 
not a time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I am in a great straight, I pray God assist 
me; and I here appeale to
Almighty God and to all the world, that I doe against my soul and    
conscience nothing
that shall be to the prejudice of the priviledges of the Laws of</font>   
England; <font>if there shall
be any thing in these proceedings that shall be to the disadvantage  
of others, my soul be
clear of it, the guilt be upon others; seeing I am necessitated upon 
this, and cannot have
Counsell assigned me for the judicature, for the legality of it, I   
referring my selfe to

Law, I desire it may be read.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is not granted to any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, Will you take away that liberty     
that we shall not know by what
Commission we are tryed, and who are our Judges? I desire I may not

president.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is visible who are your Judges, they are     
named by Act of 
Parliament: We are your Judges.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, if the Act specifie any such thing

done: I desire it may be read, that I may have a legal and just

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have all the privileges that may be;  
but you must first plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I demand this, to hear the          
Commission read.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Pray let him know what is done, to 
warn him, lest he
fall into the same condemnation. There was one but a little before   
you that
demanded the same thing, and the Court hath ruled it otherwise, and  
he hath
received his Sentence. I tell you of it that you may beware, and     
know how to carry
your self. If Mr. <font>Mordant</font> will be pleased to answer whether or   
no guilty of those
Crimes, then he shall have a fair Trial, and full Examination: If    
otherwise, the
same Sentence must be required as before; that is, upon refusall,    
the Judgement
pronounced for High Treason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I humbly crave the Act may be read.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Act is publick; the Court are not to    
give you an account of
their authority, or the way of their proceedings; they require your  
Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, shall I not know by what Law I am   
tryed, nor by what Act,
nor by what Commission?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seem to be a young Gentleman; I wish rather 
you would plead
Not guilty, or make an ingenuous Confession.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, This is the first time that I have  
been before any Court in my
life, I desire that my reason may be convinced; either assigne me    
Counsel to argue it
with this learned Councel, and if they convince my Counsel I shall   
submit: or, if this
Councel will say, the Law doth debar me the hearing of the           
Commission and the Act
read to me, I shall refer it to the Judges of the Law, and by their  
opinions I will
stand or fall.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord President, You have offered that    
Gent. very seasonable
advice, I wish he may be capable of it: And, in these debates, I     
wish he doth not
lose those advantages that are really intended for him. For the      
Court, it is by Act
of Parl. and no Judicature in <font>Engl.</font> can require any account of   
their proceedings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr.</font> Mord.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, Pray give me leave to ask this      
question, Whether there be any
president for this?</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By way of advise I do acquaint you that      
there is no Judicature in 
<font>England</font> superiour <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: superionr</comment> to this, but the    
Parliament immediately; You are here Impeached
of a very high Crime, High Treason, it may be a strain of youth, the 
first step to
mercy is confession.
<pagebreak id="C2R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I have heard that the Judges of the   
Land are the best and
proper Expositors of the Law, and if they declare that this is the   
sense of the Act, I'le 
submit to the Court; if the Court will allow me Counsel I shall      
submit if my Counsel be
convinced; I desire to hear the Commission read.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, this Gent. was a fellow-prisoner    
with one that went before
him, he walks after the same steps, I wish he may not run into the   
same Error;
these things were urged by Dr. <font>Hewet</font> , and the Court hath ruled  
that their
Authority is sufficient, and therefore my Lord be pleased that this  
Gent. may plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am overborn both for Jury and Counsel, I     
desire that my reason may
be convinced, if this Counsel will give it under their hands that    
this is Law by the Act
of 1656. if you will say under your hands that this is Law that I    
must be excluded of
Jury and Counsel, and that I must not know the Commission by which I 
am tryed, I will
proceed.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am afraid you have received ill advise from   
others, possibly you know
what is become of that Prisoner that spake of Counsel; we cannot     
assign you
Counsel as to matter of Fact; the Law and Act of Parliament have     
made us your
Judges, and therefore you are to plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I desire that that Act may be read to 
know whether I am to
be excluded of Jury and Counsel; I referre it to this Counsel.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I doubt the Gent. is in jest, we are here to 
attend by command of his
Highness the L. Protector; these Gent. are all sworn by Act of       
Parliament: it is a
little slighting of the Court, to appeal from the Court to the       
Counsel; but (my
Lord) I beseech you he may forbear to say he is overborn. You shall  
have Justice
done if you will plead, if not there was a President but now; if you 
please to put
your self upon the Trial, you shall have a fair Trial.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, convince me by this Act that I am to  
lose the right of Jury;
I have not heard any reason why I must lose it.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do tell you the Court hath given Judgment  
just now in the like
case.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I ask a President for this.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you a President, Sir <font>H. Slingsby</font>  
and Dr. <font>Hewet</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Is it a good President? if any give an ill     
president, it is reason I should
debate it my self.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I humbly conceive that this Court is your    
Court, and you ought
to plead it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I desire I may be heard; the words    
are, that the respective
Commissioners, or the major part of them, are to meet, &amp;c. I humbly  
conceive without the
whole I cannot be tryed.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All this that you ask of us now we have    
declared this morning
already to one who was before you at the Bar; the <font> <foreign>Quorum</foreign> </font>   
of this Commission is
seventeen or any more of them: we must require you again to plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I desire a little patience, the       
number of the Commissioners is
seventeen, I conceive that must be very much strained in reason that 
they must try,
because it relates to the respective Commissioners; several persons  
were allowed Counsel,
I humbly desire Counsel.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is when there is matter of Law, you   
have alledged nothing,
you are now upon matter of Fact.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, my Indictment is matter of Law, and   
upon that I may safely
demand Counsel, I desire to have Counsel as to my Indictment.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your reason and my reason and all reason   
must submit to the Law:
you are now upon matter of Fact, the single question is, guilty or   
not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My advise to you is, that you would put your 
self upon your
Tryal.
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am not convinced at all, but forced upon it, 
and it is a hard thing; it is
reason that my reason should be convinced, if this Act doth say in   
any place that I must
lose those priviledges, or if the Judges will declare it to be so, I 
will submit to it; if
the Judges will declare that I must be tryed thus, God's will be     
done, I desire to stand
and fall by the Laws.</font>
<comment type="compiler">SOL. ELLIS'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I do not shun to be tryed by the Act of        
Parliament, but referre my selfe to
the Judges, that those priviledges of the Act may not be taken from  
me,</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Parliament hath thought fit to go this   
way, and it is not to be
disputed, they that live in this nation are not to dispute it: if    
that Gent. will please
to recollect himself, and not (my Lord) thus expostulate and dispute 
with the
Court of Justice, if he please to put himself upon a Tryal, if he    
thinks himself
innocent, I think it is best; and if he refuse it, his sentence is   
from himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I do not (my Lord) dispute the power of the    
Court, but I desire my
reason may be convinced, and that I may have Counsel.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are clearly of opinion, we have not power   
in this case to appoint
any other Jury, not to summon a Jury, we our selves have taken an    
oath; you would
do well to plead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr.Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I have but little to say, and that is, 
that as that Gent. said,
it was referred to the Court what Jury I shall have, I desire (my    
Lord) to know
whether the Court doth intend to try me by a Jury.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. Ellis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They do not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Is the Court Judge and Jury?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will deal ingenuously with the Court,  
I think that is best.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Seeing I am here overuled, though not          
convinced in my reason, I shall
demur to the Court, and plead not Guilty. I desire a Copy of my      
indictment, and time
to plead.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was never done; for any Indictment of High   
Treason was never
delivered to any Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I urge my Lord</font> Cooke <font>for Authority, for a  
copy of my Indictment</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Phelphs</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Mordant Esquire</font> , you stand here    
charged of High Treason;
to this charge you plead not guilty, is this your Plea?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Yes.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I beg (my Lord) that my ignorance of the Laws  
may not prejudice
<pagebreak id="C3R" />
me, not understanding or knowing any thing of the Law; and this      
granted me, I shall
address to my justification.</font>

Mr. <font>Mordant</font> with
you, touching the bringing in of <font>Charles Stuart</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been in Mr. <font>Mordants</font> company   
several times, and
what I can say will not be much; Mr. <font>Mordant</font> did once tell me    
there was such a
design as the bringing in of the King, and he did ask me if I did    
not know of such
a thing; I told him no; he was pleased to tell me somewhat of it: I  
asked him
if he was engaged in it; he told me he was not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he tell you concerning his being     
entrusted by the King
therein?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me the King wrote to him, to      
speak to his friends that
they would be ready to assist him when he should come into           
<font>England</font> with force,
which he told me was with 7000 men; this was the chief of all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he not say that he had Commissions from   
the King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did not tell me so, but I have heard   
him say others had
had Commissions, two other Gent. in <font>Surrey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he not encourage you thereto? what        
Arguments did he use?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Stapley,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He spoke to me of it several times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After what manner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Onely in commendation of the thing; I heard 
him say that if there
were a necessity, <font>Surry</font> folks would come into <font>Sussex</font> to      
assist them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was present at any of these discourses?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was none but him and my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>At. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what place, and at what time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Near his own house at several times; I have 
told you the main of
the discourses.
<pagebreak id="C3V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Stapley, about what time was this</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. Stapley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Above a year since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Stapley, at what place was the             
encouragement made</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Stap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know what he means by Encouragement,  
he onely told me
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I desire to know when I told you that I had    
received a Letter to
encourage my friends from beyond Sea, and who was by.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Stap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no body by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About what time did he tell you of this Letter?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was by?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Stap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No body my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. Ellis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you it was the King that     
wrote to him, and therefore
it was just to assist him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Stap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think I heard him say so, I cannot take my   
Oath of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you what considerable persons were  
concerned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Stap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard him speak of some persons that    
were ingaged in this
design, Sir <font>Fran. Vincent</font> , and one <font>Brown</font> ; he said that Sir 
<font>Will. Waller</font> spake to him
to speak to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Stap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Above a year since, it was since the Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Mordant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I do not know Sir</font> W. Waller.
