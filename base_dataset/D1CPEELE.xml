   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Both:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Content Gammer that will we doo.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old wom:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Once vppon a time there was a
King or a Lord, or a Duke that had a faire
daughter, the fairest that euer was; as white as snowe,
and as redd as bloud: and once vppon a time his
daughter was stollen away, and hee sent all his
men to seeke out his daughter, and hee sent so
long, that he sent all his men out of his Land.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fan:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well sed, on with your tale Gammer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old woman:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord I quite forgot, there
was a Coniurer, and this Coniurer could doo
any thing, and hee turned himselfe into a great
Dragon, and carried the Kinges Daughter away
in his mouth to a Castle that hee made of stone,
and there he kept hir I know not how long, till
at last all the Kinges men went out so long, that
hir two Brothers went to seeke hir. O I forget:
she (he I would say) turned a proper yong man
to a Beare in the night, and a man in the day, and
keeps by a crosse that parts three seuerall waies,
&amp; he made this Lady run mad: gods me bones
who comes here? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter the two Brothers.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Frol:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soft Gammer, here some come to tell
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
your tale for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fant:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let them alone, let vs heare what they
will say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>1. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Vpon these chalkie Cliffs of <font>Albion</font>
We are ariued now with tedious toile,
And compassing the wide world round about
To seeke our sister, to seeke faire <font>Delya</font> forth,
Yet cannot we so much as heare of hir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>2. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O fortune cruell, cruell &amp; vnkind,
Vnkind in that we cannot find our sister;
Our sister haples in hir cruell chance:
Soft who haue we here.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Senex at the Crosse stooping to gather.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>1. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now father God be your speed,
What doo you gather there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hips and Hawes, and stickes and
strawes, and thinges that I gather on the ground
my sonne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>1. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hips and Hawes, and stickes and
strawes, why is that all your foode father?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea sonne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>2. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Father, here is an Almes pennie
for mee, and if I speede in that I goe for, I will
giue thee as good a Gowne of gray as euer thou
diddest weare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>1. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And Father here is another almes
pennie for me, and if I speede in my iourney, I
will giue thee a Palmers staffe of yuorie, and a
scallop shell of beaten gold.
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was shee fayre?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>2. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I the fairest for white, and the
purest for redd, as the blood of the Deare, or the
driuen snow: 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old m:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then harke well and marke well, my old spell:
Be not afraid of euery stranger,
Start not aside at euery danger:
Things that seeme are not the same,
Blow a blast at euery flame:
For when one flame of fire goes out, 
Then comes your wishes well about:
If any aske who told you this good,
Say the white Beare of Englands wood.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>1. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brother heard you not what the
old man said: <comment type="compiler">HE REPEATS THE VERSE.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>2. Brother:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well if this doo vs any good,
Wel fare the white Bear of Englands wood. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>ex.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Old ma:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now sit thee here &amp; tel a heauy tale.
Sad in thy moode, and sober in thy cheere,
Here sit thee now and to thy selfe relate,
The hard mishap of thy most wretched state.
In <font>Thessalie</font> I liu'd in sweete content,
Vntill that Fortune wrought my ouerthrow;
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
For there I wedded was vnto a dame,
That liu'd in honor, vertue, loue, and fame:
But <font>Sacrapant</font> that cursed sorcerer,
Being besotted with my beauteous loue:
My deerest loue, my true betrothed wife,
Did seeke the meanes to rid me of my life,
But worse than this, he with his chanting spels,
Did turne me straight vnto an vgly Beare;
And when the sunne doth settle in the west,
Then I begin to don my vgly hide:
And all the day I sit, as now you see,
And speake in riddles all inspirde with rage,
Seeming an olde and miserable man:
And yet I am in April of my age.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Venelia <font>his Lady mad; and goes in againe</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
See where <font>Venelya</font> my betrothed loue,
Runs madding all inrag'd about the woods;
All by his curssed and inchanting spels.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Lampriscus <font>with a pot of Honney</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
But here comes <font>Lampriscus</font> my discontented
neighbour. How now neighbour, you looke
towarde the ground aswell as I, you muse on
something.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lamp:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neighbour on nothing, but on the
matter I so often mooued to you: if you do any
thing for charity, helpe me; if for neighborhood
or brotherhood, helpe me: neuer was one so
combered as is poore <font>Lampryscus</font> : and to
begin, I pray receiue this potte of Honny to mend
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
your fare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thankes neighbor, set it downe,
Honny is alwaies welcome to the Beare.
And now neighbour let me heere the cause of
your comming.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lampriscus:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am (as you knowe
neighbour) a man vnmaried, and liued so vnquietly
with my two wiues, that I keepe euery yeare
holy the day wherin I buried the~ both; the first
was on saint <font>Andrewes</font> day; the other on saint
<font>Lukes</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And now neighbour, you of this
country say, your custome is out: but on with
your tale neighbour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lamp:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my first wife, whose tongue
wearied me aliue, and sounded in my eares like the
clapper of a great Bell, whose talke was a
continuall torment to all that dwelt by her, or liued
nigh her, you haue heard me say I had a
handsome daughter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True neighbour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lampr:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shee it is that afflictes me with her
continuall clamoures, and hangs on me like a
Burre: poore shee is, and proude shee is, as
poore as a sheepe new shorne, and as proude
of her hopes, as a Peacock of her taile well
growne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well said <font>Lampryscus</font> , you speake
it like an Englishman.
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lampr:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As curst as a waspe, and as frowarde
as a childe new taken from the mothers teate,
shee is to my age, as smoake to the eyes, or as
vinegar to the teeth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Holily praised neighbour, as much
for the next.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lampr:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my other wife I had a daughter,
so hard fauoured, so foule and ill faced, that I
thinke a groue full of golden trees; and the
leaues of Rubies and Dyamonds, would not
bee a dowrie aunswerable to her
deformitie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well neighbour, nowe you haue
spoke, heere me speake; send them to the Well
for the water of life: there shall they finde their
fortunes vnlooked for; Neighbour farewell.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lampr:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Farewell and a thousand, and now
goeth poore <font>Lampryscus</font> to put in execution
this excellent counsell. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Frol:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why this goes rounde without a
fidling stick; but doo you heare Gammer, was this
the man that was a Beare in the night, and a
man in the day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old woman:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I this is hee; and this man that
came to him was a beggar, and dwelt vppon a
greene. But soft, who comes here? O these are
the haruest men; ten to one they sing a song of
mowing.
<pagebreak id="B4V" />

Song double repeated.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Fant:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gammer, what is he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old woman:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O this is one that is going to the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huan:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now by <font>Mars</font> and <font>Mercury, Iupiter</font>

Pallas</font> and <font>Proserpina</font> , and by the honor of my
house <font>Polimackeroeplacydus</font> , it is a wonder to see
what this loue will make silly fellowes
aduenture, euen in the wane of their wits, and infansie
of their discretion. Alas my friend what fortune
calles thee foorth to seeke thy fortune among
brasen gates, inchanted towers, fire and
Brimstone, thunder and lightning. Beautie I tell thee
is peerelesse, and she precious whom thou
affectest: do off these desires good countriman,
good friend runne away from thy selfe, and so
soone as thou canst, forget her; whom none
must inherit but he that can monsters tame,
labourers atchiue, riddles absolue, loose
inchantments, murther magicke, and kill coniuring: and
that is the great and mighty <font>Huanebango</font> .

Coniurer if he were ten Coniurers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huan:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue abandoned the Court and
honourable company, to doo my deuoyre against
this sore Sorcerer and mighty Magitian: if this

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huan:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If shee bee mine, as I assure my selfe
the heauens will doo somewhat to reward my
worthines; shee shall bee allied to none of the
meanest gods; but bee inuested in the most
famous stocke of <font>Huanebango
Polimackeroeplacidus</font> , my Grandfather: my father

where the wise man the Coniurer dwells?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huan:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where that earthly Goddesse
keepeth hir abode; the commander of my thougts,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old man:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faire inough, and farre inough

or passe for a pudding, I tell you father hee has
kept such a begging of mee for a peece of this
Cake, whoo he comes vppon me with a
superfantiall substance, and the foyson of the earth,
that I know not what he meanes: If hee came
to me thus, and said, my friend <font>Booby</font> or so, why
I could spare him a peece with all my heart; but
when he tells me how God hath enriched mee
aboue other fellowes with a Cake: why hee
makes me blinde and deafe at once: Yet father
heere is a peece of Cake for you as harde as the
world goes.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sacrapant:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The day is cleare, the Welkin
bright and gray,
The Larke is merrie, and records hir notes;
Each thing reioyseth vnderneath the Skie,
But onely I whom heauen hath in hate:
Wretched and miserable <font>Sacrapant</font> ,
In <font>Thessalie</font> was I borne and brought vp,
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
My mother <font>Meroe</font> hight a famous Witch,
And by hir cunning I of hir did learne,
To change and alter shapes of mortall men,
There did I turne my selfe into a Dragon,
And stole away the Daughter to the King;
Faire <font>Delya</font> , the Mistres of my heart:
And brought hir hither to reuiue the man,
That seemeth yong and pleasant to behold,
And yet is aged, crooked, weake and numbe.
Thus by inchaunting spells I doo deceiue,

crooked man; though to each mans eye he
seemed young and fresh, for maister; this Coniurer
tooke the shape of the olde man that kept the
