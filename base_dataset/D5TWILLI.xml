   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Prisoner address'd himself to the Court;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen,
I must confess, this is a very heavy and severe Charge; but,
I hope, it is not all Fact that is alledged against me. -- I shall
not take up much time, but leave it to the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The President said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you may depend upon it the Court 
will do you Justice. -- </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Prisoner answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure 
they will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Capt. <font>Timothy Neucella</font> , late Lieutenant of the             
<font>Marlborough</font> ,
was called in, in support of the Charge. Being sworn, his
Deposition was read, setting forth, That he was 2d 
Lieutenant of the <font>Marlborough</font> , on the 11th of <font>February</font> ,    
1743,                                                               
which Ship was stationed as the second a-stern of Admiral
<font>Mathews</font> : That in the Morning, Admiral <font>Mathews</font> made 
the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head -- That Capt. 
<font>Williams</font> then commanded the <font>Royal-Oak</font> ; and that she was in
View of the Signal; and that the Combined Fleet was then 
about two or three Miles distant from the Center of his 
Majesty's Fleet -- That about eleven the Signal was made to
engage; and about one, the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlborough</font> bore
down and engaged the <font>Real</font> , and her Second a-stern; and 
that the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal-Oak</font> did not bear down so near as
the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlborough</font> did, nor near enough to be 
within Point-Blank; and that from the Beginning of the 
Engagement, till five in the Afternoon, the <font>Rupert</font> and            
<font>Royal-Oak</font>                                                       
were to Windward of the Line; that the <font>Royal-Oak</font> was
further to Leeward, in the beginning, than any of the other
Ships; and that there were no Ships for the <font>Rupert</font> and 
<font>Royal-Oak</font> properly to engage. -- That a great many Guns were
fired by the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal-Oak</font> , at too great a Distance;
that the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlborough</font> , were hard press'd by the 
Enemy; the <font>Marlborough</font> had her Main and Mizen Masts
shot away; that the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal-Oak</font> were in Sight of
the <font>Marlborough's</font> Distress, and capable of yielding her 
Assistance; but neither of them bore down to assist her. That
about four the <font>Ann-Galley</font> Fireship bore down, and was not
covered by any of the other Ships; and that the <font>Rupert</font> and 
<font>Royal-Oak</font> might have done that Service, if their Commanders
had thought proper.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the            
<font>Royal-Oak</font> in the Line,
when the <font>Namur</font> began to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell; I did not see her then; when I saw her,
she made a small Angle with us.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the lower Gun-Deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to Leeward of the three other  
Ships 
a-stern? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Time did you see her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Once before she came down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw her fire some Guns; but I think not within the 
Reach of Point-Blank, she was at too great a Distance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the first Part of the Engagement, was there any
Ship for the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to engage with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The five sternmost Ships were not come up: they did
not come up till two or three Hours after the Beginning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ship could she then engage with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 2d or 3d Ship a-stern of the <font>Spanish</font> Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ships were a-stern of the <font>Spanish</font> Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Six. Five at a great Distance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Number were in a Line with the <font>Spanish</font> 
Admiral? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Only one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw the <font>Royal-Oak</font> fire, what Ship did she
fire at? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 2d or 3d Ship from the <font>Spanish</font> Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it in the latter Part of the Engagement?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, two Hours after we began; she might fire before
that; and I believe she did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she in a Line with the Admiral, when you first
saw her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was a little upon our Weather Quarter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she in a Line with the Admiral, at his first 
engaging? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> ever in a Line with you?       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in a Line with the Admiral at first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When we first brought to, the Admiral was as near in
a Line as could be; he was rather upon our Weather-Bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw the <font>Royal-Oak</font> , was it in her power 
to 
engage closely?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She must have gone to Leeward of the other Ships if
she had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could the <font>Royal-Oak</font> have engaged any Ships closely 
without going to Leeward of the <font>Marlborough</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had bore down in a Line with us at the first, 
he
might afterwards have engaged properly with the other <font>Spanish</font>
Ships that were coming up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engaged, was it in her power to
have engaged in a Line with you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe she might.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in a proper Line with the Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, as exactly as could be.
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it in the Power of the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to give the 
<font>Marlborough</font> any Assistance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had crouded a-head, she might have lain upon
our Quarter, and given us Assistance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> from you, when you first 
lost your Masts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw her a little after we lost our Masts; and she  
was
then a Mile and half from us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could you see what Sail she had set?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could, but did not observe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Number of Shot from the <font>Royal-Oak</font> 
fall short? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know she was not within Point-Blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I judge only by the Distance of the Ships, and she did
not appear to be near enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Distance was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> from the      
Ship she 
might have engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she had made proper Sail, and shot a-head those   
Ships
between her and us, she might have given us the proper 
Assistance by engaging the <font>Hercules</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Distance was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> from you, when 
you saw her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Mile and half, or two Miles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Wind then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there enough for a Ship to answer her Helm?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she never edge down after you first saw her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see that she did, till after the Admiral   
wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she appear to be at Windward or to Leeward of the 
three Ships between you and her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think she appeared to Leeward of the three; she was 
a Mile and half from us, and a-stern with all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much upon your Quarter? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Points.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Points was the Admiral upon your Bow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Point.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which of the four Ships a-stern then appeared to be 
most in a Line with the Admiral?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Royal-Oak</font> was the Leewardmost of all, she was
almost in the Line.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> never nearer you than a Mile   
and half?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe not till they all bore away -- but I 
cannot be exact as to the Distance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> how she engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not see her engaged till after the Wearing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> in the whole?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Hours and a half from the first I saw her.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never see her out of your Stern Ports?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, before we lost our Masts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to the second a-stern 
of the 
<font>Spanish</font> Admiral then. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half a Mile, or something less.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ship did she fire at?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was at the <font>Hercules</font> ; but I could   
not see
plainly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not the     
<font>Royal-Oak</font> go to 
Leeward of you before the Wearing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not to my Knowledge, but I can't say she was not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Prisoner said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a remarkable thing, because
you gave us three Cheers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Witness said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I do remember it now Captain
<font>Williams</font> mentions it, that he was then to Leeward of us just
after our Masts were gone: It was before we wore; but I
had forgot it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it before the Wearing? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Court asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had the <font>Real</font> bore   
away then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you positive it was after the <font>Real</font> bore away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think she was bore away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Prisoner said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> there is a Gentleman just come to 
Town, that was a Lieutenant in the <font>Marlborough</font> ; and if 
Capt. <font>Neucella</font> does not remember it, perhaps he may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Court said he should be called presently.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then the Judge Advocate told the Court, that 
Lieutenant <font>Hale</font> , of the <font>Marlborough</font> , was just come home,   
and if
the Court pleased, he might be called. And he came into
Court accordingly.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>Lieutenant <font>Hale</font> came into Court, and was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>The Court asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the middle Gun-Deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The court desired him to relate what he knew relating to
the <font>Royal-Oak</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Witness said</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know very little of her at the beginning.
Soon after the Admiral ordered us to bear down; I went down
to my Quarters, when our Masts were gone I went upon
Deck, then I saw the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to Leeward of the rest of our
Ships a-stern of the <font>Marlborough</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this after your Masts were gone? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that all you know? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distance was she from you then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was upon our Weather Quarter, about half a Mile
from us then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was the Enemies Ships?
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within Point-blank of those Ships a-stern of us, that 
were coming up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which of 'em did she fire at? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Head  
most.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within Point-blank? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did she engage her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, they were firing before I came upon   
Deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did she engage from the Time you saw her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three Quarters of an Hour, after the Time I saw her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What made her leave off? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was engaging when I left the Ship, and went on 
Board of the Admiral, I did not observe what she was doing
after that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you first observed the <font>Royal-Oak</font> , how many 
Ships were between you and her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were Three between us, there were some of 'em
further off than the <font>Royal-Oak</font> : The <font>Essex</font> was further off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to Leeward of all those Ships?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, she was to Leeward of all the Four Sail.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then there was hardly Room for the other Ships, if she
was within half a Mile of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The others were further to Windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> , when you saw her, as far to  
Leeward 
as the Admiral, when she began to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think she was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever observe any Signals, besides that for the
Line of Battle, and that to engage, after your Masts were 
gone?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a Signal in the Morning for the 
Vice-Admiral to make more Sail; and after our Masts were gone, the
Signal for Battle was haul'd down, and a white Flag was 
hoisted at the Fore-Topmast head, and a Gun was fired.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was when I went to seek for the Frigates to       
assist us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Time of the Day was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was about Sun-sett; it was after we wore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> to Leeward of your 
Ship? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember her being cheer'd by you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: I was not on Board then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw her; what Position was the Enemy 
from her? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some of 'em were a-stern upon her Quarter, and two 
Shot abreast of her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> then to the Enemy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those which she fired at, she was within Gun-shot of: 
I saw their Shot go over her.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Royal-Oak</font> had gone nearer, when you saw   
her,
must not she have broke the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: She must have been to Leeward of us; and to
Leeward of the Line.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the Admiral from you then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon our Weather-bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much upon your Weather-bow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Points.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what distance? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did the <font>Royal-Oak</font> , engage within 
Point-blank, before the Admiral wore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was gone before the Admiral wore: she was then     
engaging.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was you cheer'd at first by the             
<font>Royal-Oak</font> ,                 
before the Engagement began?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An Hour and half, or Two Hours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engaging?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am very sure Three Quarters of an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she near enough to do sufficient Execution?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was within Point-blank, I saw the Shot from the 
Enemy go over her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What distance was she from the Ship she engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember how many Cables length: I believe
Three Quarters of a Mile; I saw the Shot go over her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why do you think she was within Point-blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I saw the Shot go over her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any Shot from the Enemy fall short of her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: I never did see any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you engaging then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Real</font> was then upon our Bow, and we could not
bring our Guns to bear upon her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Namur</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To Windward of us, engaging the <font>Real</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the <font>Hercules</font> doing then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Hercules was firing at us, and we at her: but

not bring our Guns to bear upon the <font>Real</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you receive much Damage from the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe most of the Damage we received, was from the 
<font>Hercules</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Juan Baptista</font> , Pilot of the <font>Marlborough</font> , was     
called 
in. His Deposition read, setting forth, that he was 
Pilot of the <font>Marlborough</font> , the Ship stationed next a-stern of 
the Admiral, on the <font>11th</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR NUMBER 11 IN SOURCE    
TEXT</comment> of <font>February</font> , 1743. That
about Nine or Ten the Signals was made, for the Line of
Battle, a-head: That the <font>Rupert</font> , was in sight of the 
Signal, that about Half an Hour past Ten, the Signal was
made to engage, and that about One, the <font>Namur</font> and 
<pagebreak id="12" /> 
<font>Marlborough</font> bore down, and engaged the <font>Real</font> , and her
Second a-stern. That at the beginning, and during the
whole Engagement, the <font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal-Oak</font> were out 
of Point-Blank. That the <font>Marlborough</font> was disabled,
having her Main and Mizen Masts shot away; and that 
the <font>Essex</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal-Oak</font> were capable of giving
her Assistance, but did not. That the <font>Anne-Galley</font> Fireship 
bore down between 3 and 4; and that the <font>Essex</font> , 
<font>Rupert</font> , and <font>Royal-Oak</font> might have covered her. That if
any of the four Ships a-stern of the <font>Marlborough</font> had bore
down to succour her, they might have done it, and 
might have stopped the sternmost of the <font>Spanish</font> Ships
from getting a-head, till the Vice-Admiral, and his 
Division, could have got up.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see   
the <font>Royal-Oak</font> 
engage the Enemy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After we had done engaging, I saw a Ship more to
Leeward, than any of the others a-stern, and believe it was 
the <font>Royal-Oak</font> hailed us, cheered us, and came to Leeward 
of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> then within Point-Blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Shot fell short of her at first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> within Point-Blank before you  
lost
your Masts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell whether she was within Point-Blank.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> at the nearest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within half a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> fire after you lost your 
Masts? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Royal-Oak</font> had bore down, and engaged the  
four
Ships of the Enemy that were coming up closely, would not 
she have been to Leeward of the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, because those Ships were to Leeward of the      
<font>Real</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she near enough to do Execution?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, in the latter Part of the Action, after we had
done engaging.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she make all the Sail she could from her first 
coming into the Fleet? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was in the Line.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could the <font>Royal-Oak</font> have bore down sooner than she
did? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, all the ships a-stern of us might.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ship could she have engaged then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Hercules</font> , or the headmost of the four Ships 
that 
were coming up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distance was the headmost of the <font>Spanish</font>    
Ships
from the <font>Royal-Oak</font> then? 
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say she was not far from them; if she had
bore away she might have attacked them, or the Ship a-stern
the <font>Spanish</font> Admiral that plagued us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What distance was the headmost of the four <font>Spanish</font>
Ships coming up from you at the beginning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At a great distance, 2 Miles and half a-stern, and   
to
Leeward upon our Lee-Quarter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distance was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She was sternmost of the four that were a-stern of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> within Gun-shot of the Enemy
then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could she have gone within Gun-shot without going to
Leeward of the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if she had bore down with us she might.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distance was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> from you, when she
engaged? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell exactly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ship was nearest you, when you lost your Masts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The two middle Ships were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you, when you lost your Masts, look at the 
Admiral? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was he then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Till we lost our Masts, he was to the South-East upon
our Weather-Bow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe any Signal the Admiral had out then,
besides that for the Line of Battle, and to engage? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could the <font>Royal-Oak</font> have given you any Succour, if
she had bore down properly. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could she have bore down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was Wind enough for them all to come up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> in her Station at the beginning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If all the four Ships had bore down, would the       
<font>Spanish</font>
Ships coming up have weathered them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I believe not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long were you engaged before you saw the 
<font>Royal-Oak</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw her just after we had lost our Masts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she fire before that? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Ships she could have fired at?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. After our Masts were gone I could not see any
Ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the <font>Royal-Oak</font> escape within Point-Blank of the
Enemy?
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Their Shot could reach one another very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Lieutenant <font>Hide</font> , of the <font>Marlborough</font> , was called in
and sworn, and asked by the Court.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the upper Deck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then his Deposition was read, setting forth, That,
between 9 and 10, the Signal was made for the Line of
Battle a-head; that about 1, the Admiral and 
<font>Marlborough</font> bore down and engaged; soon after the 
<font>Marlborough</font> was disabled, the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Norfolk</font> were then
engaged with the Enemy; that the <font>Rupert</font> and the 
<font>Royal-Oak</font> , might have assisted the <font>Marlborough</font> , but did not;
that the <font>Ann-Galley</font> Fireship bore down, and that the
<font>Rupert</font> and <font>Royal-Oak</font> might have cover'd her, but did
not.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the            
<font>Royal-Oak</font> within Point-Blank?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell all the Ships a-stern of us were to 
Windward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it ever in the <font>Royal-Oak's</font> power to have     
engaged
the Enemy. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> when you began to engage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were all to Windward. I did not mind her 
particularly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many of our Ships were a-stern of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Dorsetshire</font> , <font>Essex</font> , <font>Rupert</font> , and   
<font>Royal-Oak</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Might any of them have bore down and engaged as well
as you? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say there was Wind enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could not they then have bore down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they might.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engaged with the 
Enemy? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> firing when you saw her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Q.</font> </comment> I never saw her fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> from the               
<font>Marlborough</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Humphry</font> St. <font>Hill</font> , Mate of the <font>Marlborough</font> , was   
called in,
and sworn, the Court asked:</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was you quartered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Braces forwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then his Deposition was read, setting forth, That on the 
11th of <font>February</font> 1743, he was Mate of the 
<font>Marlborough</font> : That in the Morning a Signal was made for the
Line of Battle a-head: That Captain <font>Williams</font> commanded
<pagebreak id="15" /> 
the <font>Royal-Oak</font> , and Captain <font>Ambrose</font> the 
<font>Rupert</font> ; that the Combined Fleet was about three or four
Miles Distance from our Centre, when the said Signal
was made; that about 11 the Signal was made to engage,
and about 1 the <font>Namur</font> and <font>Marlborough</font> bore down
and engaged the <font>Real</font> and <font>Hercules</font> ; that the <font>Rupert</font> and
<font>Royal-Oak</font> bore down, but not so near as they ought to
have done, as there was Wind enough.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Court asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ship could    
the <font>Royal-Oak</font>  
have engaged, if she had bore down in your Wake?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The second, the headmost of the 5 Sail a-stern of the
<font>Spanish</font> Admiral.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she within Gun-shot at first? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I     
think not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the <font>Royal-Oak</font> had bore down in your Wake, could 
she have assisted you against the <font>Hercules</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you receive any Damage from the <font>Hercules</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, a good deal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Therefore, if the <font>Royal-Oak</font> had bore down, she   
might
have assisted? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> engage? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Distance? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After your Masts were gone, could she have gone 
nearer without breaking the Line?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe not; the four Ships a-stern would have     
fetch'd
into the <font>Marlborough's</font> Wake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she in a Line with you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Admiral haul off first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Admiral said to our Captain, Do you bear down,
and I will follow you. -- The Admiral fired a Quarter-Deck
Shot, and after half an Hour the Admiral hauled his Wind,
and broke the Line.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distance was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> from you at the  
first 
beginning? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two or three Miles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the headmost of the <font>Spanish</font> Ships    
from you
then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two or three Miles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> the Leewardmost of the four    
Ships
a-stern of you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever observe any Signal made by the Admiral
after the <font>Marlborough's</font> Masts were gone, besides the Signal to
engage? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think the <font>Royal-Oak</font> was within Point-Blank
when she fired? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I saw her Smoke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe how long she engaged? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you saw her Smoke, was she at the proper

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I cannot say, but I think not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> or the <font>Rupert</font> at   
the greatest

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any thing of any Cheers from the
<font>Royal-Oak</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you lost your Masts, which of the four Ships 
a-stern was nearest you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Dorsetshire</font> .

fire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was after two, and after our masts were gone;
when the Masts went away, I saw two Ships a-stern fire at 
the Ships coming up, and I looked out to see which, and 
believe it was the <font>Royal-Oak</font> and <font>Rupert</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Time did you see the <font>Royal-Oak</font> last?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never after that Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Prisoner asked.) </font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the

<font>Essex</font> , or <font>Rupert</font> firing at the Time you say I could have come
down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About two I saw the <font>Dorsetshire</font> , and believe    
you were 
firing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I had gone down, should not I have gone through
their Fire? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say.
