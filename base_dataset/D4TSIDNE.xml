   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray call Mr. <font>West</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Who         
appeared.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray one word, my Lord, before Mr.        
<font>West</font> be
sworn, I have heard, my Lord, Mr. <font>West</font> hath confessed many
Treasons, and I desire to know whether he is pardoned, or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, how can he be a Witness then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Swear him: for I know no Legal Objection    
against
him. He was a good Witness in my Lord <font>Russel's</font> Tryal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if another did not except against  
him, 'tis
nothing to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>North.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray give an account to the Court of what you
know of a general Insurrection intended in <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What he knows concerning me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will take care of that, that no Evidence be 
given
but what ought to be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it ordinary that he should say any thing,   
unless it be
to me and my Indictment?
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Sidney</font> , you remember in all the       
Tryals about the
late Popish Plot, how there was first a general account given of
the Plot in <font>Coleman's</font> Tryal, and so in <font>Plunket's</font> , and       
others: I
don't doubt but you remember it. And Sir <font>William Jones</font> , 
against whose Judgment, I believe, you won't object, was Attorney
at that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>North.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>West</font> , What do you know of the general
Insurrection lately designed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have had the honor to know Collonel
<font>Sidney</font> several years; but I don't remember that I ever saw him
from the time I came acquainted with any part of the
Conspiracy, till the Discovery that was at the Council.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>North.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray give an account of what you know of the
Plot in general.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, in <font>October</font> last Captain           
<font>Walcot</font> came to
me, and told me that my Lord <font>Shaftesbury</font> had designed an
Insurrection in <font>November</font> ; I used some Arguments to disswade him
from it. But a little afterwards he came and told me the thing
was wholly disappointed, and then it went off, and my Lord
<font>Shaftesbury</font> went for <font>Holland</font> . Collonel <font>Romsey</font>           
afterwards about
Christmass said there were some Lords and Gentlemen intended to
make an Insurrection, the persons were the Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> ,
my Lord of <font>Essex</font> , my Lord <font>Howard</font> , my Lord <font>Russel</font> , the 
Prisoner
at the Bar, and Mr. <font>Hambden Junior</font> . After some time he told
me they had altered their measures, and were resolved not to
venture upon an Insurrection in <font>England</font> , till they had a
concurrency in <font>Scotland</font> . Afterwards I was not privy to any      
thing else,
but what I had the Report of from Mr. <font>Nelthorp</font> and Mr.           
<font>Ferguson</font> .
Mr. <font>Nelthorp</font> told me the Prisoner had said --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I am very unwilling to interrupt the
Gentleman --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must not interrupt the Witness. 
Go on,
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Nelthorp</font> told me, the Prisoner at the  
Bar had
sent <font>Aaron Smith</font> into <font>Scotland</font> , and given him a sum of mony
to bear his Charges, and sent Letters to some Scotch Gentlemen
to invite them to Town. The Letter bore a Cant of settling
some business in <font>Carolina</font> ; but the business was coming up about
the Insurrection. After this Mr. <font>Smith</font> returned, and some Scotch
Gentlemen with him; and soon after Mr. <font>Ferguson</font> gave an
account of that Affair, and said, the Scotch proposed, if they might
have thirty thousand pounds in ready money, they would
undertake to make an Insurrection in <font>Scotland</font> without the        
concurrence
of <font>England</font> . He said this Proposal was agreed to, and money
would be soon ready; and he said, that <font>Sheppard</font> would return the
money. That the Arms were ready bought, and my Lord of
<font>Argile</font> would go into <font>Scotland</font> , and head the Scots. He told me
<pagebreak id="15" />
when things were thus settled, some difference arose about raising
the money; and at last he told me, my Lord <font>Gray</font> did offer to raise
ten thousand pounds out of his own Estate, if the rest would pay
their proportion. Then the Scots came down to less, but that
would not be complyed with. The places for the Rising were
<font>Bristoll, Taunton, York, Chester, Exeter, London</font> . That there had
been some Debates whether they should begin at <font>London</font> , or the
other places; and at last it was resolved, they should begin at
<font>London</font> with the rest of the places.
   My Lord, this was the Account I had of the matter in general of
Mr. <font>Ferguson</font> ; but he said they were disappointed. Afterwards he
told me the Prisoner at the Bar and Major <font>Wildman</font> were very
instrumental in working of it off, because they could not agree upon
the Declaration to be made upon the Insurrection. The English
were for a Common-wealth; but the Scotch Gentlemen answered, 
Fairly it might come to it in time, but the Noblemen there would
not agree to it at present. As to the Prisoner in particular I know
nothing, and did never speak with him till since the
Discovery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Collonel <font>Romsey</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Sworn.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>North.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, will you give the Court an account of
what you know of any Insurrection intended, and how they
designed to carry it on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, the latter end of <font>October</font> , or 
beginning
of <font>November</font> , I was desired by my Lord <font>Shaftesbury</font> to go to  
Mr.
<font>Sheppards</font> to know of the Gentlemen that were met there, what
was done about the Rising intended at <font>Taunton</font> ; and I had their
answer, that Mr. <font>Trenchard</font> had fail'd them, and that it must cease
for that time. That was all at that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What else do you know of any Insurrection
afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After that we had several meetings at Mr.   
<font>West's</font>
Chamber, where we had divided the City into twenty parts, and
seven parts Mr. <font>Goodenough</font> had brought an account of; the other
thirteen he said nothing of; for he had not spoke with those that
were to tell him how many men they would afford. There was
there Captain <font>Walcot</font> , Mr. <font>West</font> , the two <font>Goodenoughs</font> ,  
Mr. <font>Borne</font> ,
Mr. <font>Wade</font> , and my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Result of those Debates?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To see what number of men they could        
produce in
the City for the Insurrection.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there a Rising designed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And did these people meet?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no time set.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was the meeting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were several meetings in <font>March</font> ,  
and <font>April</font> ,
and <font>May</font> .
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the meeting at <font>Sheppards</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, a great while. It ceased, I think, six 
weeks
or three months?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did you meet with at Mr. <font>Sheppards</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was the Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> , my     
Lord <font>Gray</font> ,
my Lord <font>Russel</font> , Sir <font>Thomas Armstrong</font> , Mr. <font>Ferguson</font> ,   
and Mr. 
<font>Sheppard</font> . 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did you expect should head this Army?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was never said any thing of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who were to manage the Rising?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We that met there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you no expectation of great men?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>West</font> told me, and Mr.               
<font>Goodenough</font> , that there
was a Council, which were the Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> , my Lord
<font>Essex</font> , my Lord <font>Howard</font> , Collonel <font>Sidney</font> , Mr.           
<font>Hambden</font> , and my
Lord <font>Russel</font> , there was Six.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he tell you of them six?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me they were managing a Business with
<font>Scotland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Justice.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Business, pray speak plain, tell  
all you
know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the Insurrection.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say so then, we know nothing of the Business   
you were
about.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr. <font>West</font> had that Discourse    
with my
Lord <font>Howard</font> I never had; he is more fit to speak to that than me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak your own knowledge, and no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the death of my Lord <font>Shaftesbury</font> ,  
who were
the Managers, and were to carry it on?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told you Mr. <font>West</font> and Mr.              
<font>Goodenough</font> did tell
me the Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> , my Lord <font>Essex</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told you so before. Do you know there  
was
an Insurrection then intended?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, because we met towards the management  
of it,
the company that met at Mr. <font>West's</font> Chamber, and other places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What discourse had you with Mr.           
<font>Ferguson</font> about it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Romsey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not about those Gentlemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>North.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The next thing we shall shew, shall be that the
Scotch men came to Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I must ever put you in mind, whether
it be ordinary to examine men upon Indictments of Treason
concerning me that I never saw, nor heard of in my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you, all this Evidence does not affect  
you, and I tell
the Jury so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But it prepossesses the Jury.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr,</font> Keiling <font>called and sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you in general, what you know of the
Rising to have been last Spring?
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Keiling.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, It was some time last Summer Mr. 
<font>Goodenough</font> came to me, and brought me <font>three</font> Papers numbred on
the back-side; I asked him to what end he delivered them me?
he told me, One was for my self, and I was to deliver the other
Two to whom I could Trust in the two Divisions. I asked him, 
What was the Design? he said, To Raise Men; sayes I, Do you
design a general Insurrection? He said, if he did not, if the King
was taken off this would do well; for then People would know
how to have recourse to a formidable Body. And I have heard
him say, That Collonel <font>Sidney</font> , whom I don't know, had a
considerable part in the management of that Affair.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We Charge him with Conspiring, and there   
must
be Confederates in the Case. Now then we come to the
Prisoner, We will call my Lord <font>Howard</font> , that was one of the
Persons that did Consult.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Lord</font> Howard <font>Sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray acquaint my Lord and the Jury of your
knowledge of what Transactions there have been with the
Prisoner about this Affair of the general Rising.
<comment type="compiler">LORD HOWARD'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was he to do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no particular Deed for him, more 
than to carry a Letter. The Duke of <font>Monmouth</font> undertook to bring
my Lord <font>Melvin</font> hither, because he had a particular dependance
upon him, and I think some Relation to his Lady: But to Sir <font>John</font>
<pagebreak id="20" />
<font>Cockram</font> there was a Letter to be sent under the disguise of      
carrying
on some business of the Plantation in <font>Carolina</font> . This Letter I
suppose was Writ by my Lord <font>Russel</font> (though I know it not) for he
was personally known to my Lord <font>Russel</font> , and I don't know that he
was known to any of us. About three Weeks after this, then he
was dispatched I suppose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what purpose were these Gentlemen to   
come
up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These were to acquaint us how they found
<font>Scotland</font> tempered, and what Opportunites or Advantages there was
or might be of putting them into a Commotion, and how Men
might be Raised, and how they would fall under <font>Argyle</font> , and also 
to
keep Time and Place with us. After this, I was with <font>Col. Sidney</font> ,
when he was going into <font>London</font> , and he did take out several
<font>Guinnies</font> , I can't tell how much 'twas, I suppose they might be  
about
<font>Sixty</font> , and put them into his pocket (and set me down at my
Lodging) which he said were to give <font>Aaron Smith</font> ; whether he gave
it or no, I don't know; and after that he was sent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who told you so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Col. <font>Sidney</font> , For I was inquiring of   
him; and he
said, he had not heard of him in three Weeks, or but once when
he was about <font>New Castle</font> . After this, I had occasions that       
called me
into the Country, and there I was. Some time after that, I went
to the <font>Bath</font> : And this is all the Account I can give.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soli. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know that <font>Aaron Smith</font> did go?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know nothing but by hear-say. Col.       
<font>Sidney</font> told
me, he was gone, and was upon the Road, and he heard from him
about <font>New Castle</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you understand by the discourse      
after he was
gone, that he went in pursuance of that Debate?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, That was the whole end of his    
going.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wythens.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you say, that Gentleman       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (speaking of
Col. <font>Sidney</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> undertook to send him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you ask him any Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have no Questions to ask him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Silence -- You know the Proverb. The next
step is to shew you my Lord, that these persons came up
immediately after <font>Aaron Smith</font> went down thither; and according   
to that which
was said to be the Shadow and Pretence of their coming hither,
they pretended they came about <font>Carolina</font> business. Sir <font>Andrew   
Foster</font>
and Mr. <font>Blathwaite</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Andrew Foster</font> Sworn.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, give an account what <font>Scotch</font>  
Gentlemen
came up lately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Andrew Foster.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, About the end of the Spring, 
or
beginning of Summer, as I remember, these Gentlemen Sir <font>John
Cockram</font> , and Commissary <font>Monro</font> , and the two <font>Cambbels</font>      
Father and
Son, came up hither. I did not see the Father at all, but I saw
<pagebreak id="21" />
the Son the day of the Lord <font>Russels</font> Tryal; but the other two, I
think I saw a little before the Discovery of the Plot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they pretend they came about?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Andrew Foster.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They pretended they came to make a
Purchase in <font>Carolina</font> , and I saw their Commission from the       
Persons
said to be concern'd in that Design.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who do you speak of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Andrew Foster.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir John Cockram</font> and Commissary  
<font>Monro</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As soon as the Rumour came of the         
<font>Plot</font> , What
became of those Gentlemen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Andrew Foster.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir John Cockram</font> absconded, but  
Commissary 
<font>Monro</font> never absconded, and the <font>Cambels</font> I heard were seized,
changing their Lodging from place to place.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Atterbury</font> Sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Atterbury</font> , Will you give my      
<font>Lord</font> and the <font>Jury</font>
an Account what you know of these <font>Scotch men</font> , their absconding
and lying hid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My <font>Lord</font> , Upon the latter end of     
<font>June</font> , or the
beginning of <font>July</font> ; the beginning of <font>July</font> it was, I was sent 
for into
<font>London</font> upon a discovery of some <font>Scotch</font> Gentlemen that lay    
about
<font>Black-Fryers</font> ; and when I came down there, there was the
Common <font>Sergeant</font> and some others, had been before me, and found
them making an escape into a <font>Boat</font> . 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who were they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir Hugh Cambel</font> , and Sir <font>John     
Cockram</font> , and one
that was committed to the <font>Gate-House</font> by the Counsel as soon as
brought thither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall end here, my Lord: How long had  
they
been in Town?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They had been in Town some little time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have done with this piece of our       
Evidence. Now
to shew that while this Emissary was in <font>Scotland</font> , at the same
time the <font>Colonel</font> (which will be another Overt Act of the Treason)
was VVriting a Treasonable <font>Pamphlet</font> . I will call you the
VVitnesses. It is all of his own writings. <font>Sir Philip Lloyd.</font>  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir Philip Lloyd</font> , Pray will you look 
upon those
Papers, and give my Lord and the Jury an account where you found  
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Philip Lloyd.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had a Warrant my Lord, from the     
<font>Secretary</font>
by the King and Council, to seize Mr. <font>Algernon Sidney's</font> Papers;
and pursuant to it, I did go to his House, and such as I found there
I put up. I found a great many upon the Table, amongst which were
these, I suppose it is where he usually writes, I put them in a
<font>Pillowbear</font> I borrowed in the House, and that in a <font>Trunk</font> ; I  
desired Coll.
<font>Sidney</font> would put his Seal upon them, that there should be no
mistake; he refused, so I took my Seal, and Sealed up the            
<font>Trunk</font> , and
it was carried before me to Mr. Secretary <font>Jenkins</font> Office. VVhen
the <font>Committee</font> sate, I was commanded to undo the <font>Trunk</font> , and  
I did
<pagebreak id="22" />
so, and found my own Seal upon it. And I took the Papers out of
the <font>Bagg</font> I put them into before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was <font>Col. Sidney</font> present when you seized 
these Papers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Phil. Lloyd.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are these some of those Papers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Phil. Lloyd.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I verily believe it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the next place, I think we have some    
Papers
of his particular Affairs which will prove his hand. Call Mr.
<font>Sheppard</font> , Mr. <font>Cooke</font> and Mr. <font>Cary</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>North.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Phil. Lloyd</font> , When were they Seized?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Phil. Lloyd.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Towards the latter end of <font>June</font> my   
Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jury-Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which <font>June</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Phil. Lloyd.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Last <font>June</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sheppard</font> Sworn.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray will you look upon those Writings     
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (shewing
the Libel) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you acquainted with <font>Col. Sidney's</font> hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sheppard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, My Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that his hand Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sheppard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir I believe so. I believe all these  
Sheets to
be his hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How come you to be acquainted with his hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sheppard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have seen him write the indorsement upon
several Bills of Exchange.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cary</font> Sworn.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire you would please to      
consider this,
That Similitude of hands can be no evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Reserve your self till anon, and make all the
advantagious Remarks you can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you had any dealing with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw him write to my knowledge more than
once in my life, but I have seen his Indorsement upon Bills, and
'tis very like that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe it is his hand as far as you 
can guess?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, It is like what came to me for his 
Hand-writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you believe it to be his Hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cary.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cooke</font> Sworn, and the Papers shewn him.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you Mr. <font>Cooke</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cooke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I did never see <font>Col. Sidney</font>      
Write, but I have
seen several Notes that have come to me with Indorsement of his
Name, and we have paid them, and 'tis like to this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you were never called to account for 
mispayment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cooke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray it may be read. We will read as     
much as
is necessary to prove the Inditement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray it may be all read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Attorney</font> must have what part he     
desires read,
<pagebreak id="23" />
and you shall have what part you will have read afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire all may be read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Begin there. <font>Secondly</font> , There was no   
Absurdity in
this, because it was their own Case.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Sheets were shewn to Col. <font>Sidney</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Colonel <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know what to make of it, I can  
read
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, no doubt of it, better than any man here.  
Fix on
any part you have a mind to have read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Colonel <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know what to say to it, to read 
it in
pieces thus.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive you have disposed them under        
certain heads: To
what heads will you have read?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Colonel <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, let him give an account of it   
that
did it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we will not delay Colonel        
<font>Sidney</font> from
entring on his defence, only we have this piece of Evidence to give
further. One of his Complices was my Lord <font>Russel</font> , we will give in
Evidence his Conviction. We will only ask my Lord <font>Howard</font> ,
Was your Lordship sworn as a Witness at the Tryal of my Lord
<font>Russel</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether or no, when you met, were there   
in those
debates any reflections upon the King, that he had broken his duty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not that I remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why would you rise?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you mean upon the misgovernment, not       
personally
upon the King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay.
<pagebreak id="27" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and principally and chiefly that, which we
thought was the general disgust of the Nation, the imposing upon the
City at that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Wythins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was complained of at that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, We took it all along to be the   
chief
grievance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any more Witnesses?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Only the Record.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know there is no time mispent to make   
things clear.
If the Jury have a mind to have the words read again --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If they have a mind, let it.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Trinder</font> was Sworn, and testified it to be a true Copy 
of
the Record, and said he examined it at <font>Fishmongers-Hall</font> with
Mr. <font>Tanner</font> .</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech>Then the Record of the Conviction of the Lord <font>Russel</font> was
read.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What will you go to next, <font>Mr. Attorney</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have done, unless the Jury desire to   
have the
words of the Libel read again. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (But they did not.) </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire to know upon what Statute 
I am 
Indicted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I will give as plain an Answer,  
You are
Indicted upon the old Statute of 25 <font>E.</font> 3.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I desire to know upon what branch of   
that
Statute?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I will acquaint you, 'Tis upon the   
first branch
of that Statute, for Conspiring and Compassing the Death of the 
King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I conceive, what does not come within  
that, does
not touch me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Make what Inferences you please Colonel,  
we will
answer you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know what the Witnesses have    
sworn against
me upon that point?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on, You have heard the Witnesses as    
well as
we.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He says, You are Indicted upon the Statute 
of 25 <font>E.</font>
3. which Statute makes it High Treason to Conspire the Death
of the King, and the Overt-Act is sufficiently set forth in the
Indictment; now the Question is, whether 'tis proved?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They have proved a Paper found in my Study of
<font>Caligula</font> and <font>Nero</font> , that is Compassing the Death of the      
King, is it? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I shall tell the Jury. The point in Law   
you are to
take from the Court, Gentlemen: Whether there be Fact sufficient,
that is your duty to consider.

<comment type="compiler">LONG SPEECH OF COL. SIDNEY OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is a point of Fact, Whether there be two
Witnesses? I tell you beforehand, one Witness is not sufficient.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then there is my Lord <font>Howard</font> , and  
never 
another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, do not make those inferences; I will tell 
the Jury,
if there be not two Witnesses as the Law requires in this Case, they
ought to acquit you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You confound me, I cannot stir. You talk of a
Conspiracy; What is a Conspiracy to kill the King? Is there any more
Witnesses than one for Levying of War?
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Pray do not deceive your self; You must not   
think the
Court and you intend to enter into a Dialogue. Answer to the Fact;
if there be not sufficient Fact, the Jury will acquit you. Make what
Answer you can to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I say, There being but one Witness, I  
am not to
Answer to it at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you rely upon that, we will direct the Jury 
presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then for Levying War, what does any one say?
My Lord <font>Howard</font> , let him if he please, reconcile what he hath said
now, with what he said at my Lord <font>Russel's</font> Trial. There he said, 
he
said all he could; and now he has got I do not know how many things
that were never spoken of there. I appeal to the Court whether he
did then speak one word of that, that he now says of Mr. <font>Hambden</font> .
He sets forth his Evidence very Rhetorically, but it does not
become a Witness, for he is only to tell what is done and said;
but he does not tell what was done and said. He says they
took upon them to consider, but does not say what one man said, or
what one man resolved, much less what I did. My Lord, If these things
are not to be distinguished, but shall be jumbled all up together, I
confess I do not know what to say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take what liberty you please. If you will make 
no
Defence, then we will direct the Jury presently. We will direct them 
in
the Law, and recollect matter of Fact as well as we can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then my Lord, I desire the Law may be
reserved to me, I desire I may have Council to that point of there   
being but
one Witness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is point of Fact. If you can give any     
testimony to
disparage the Witness, do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have a great deal to that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on to it then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then, my Lord, was there a War Levyed? Or   
was it
prevented? Why then, if it be prevented, 'tis not Levyed; if it be
not Levyed, 'tis not within the Statute; so this is nothing to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Court will have patience to hear you; but  
at the same
time I think 'tis my duty to advertise you, That this is but
mispending of your time. If you can Answer the Fact, or if you have  
any
mind to put any disparagement upon the Witnesses, that they are not
Persons to be believed, do it, but do not ask us Questions this way or
t'other.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know what the Book was in answer to. 
We are not to speak of any Book that Sir <font>Robert Filmar</font> wrote,
but you are to make your Defence, touching a Book that was
found in your Study, and spend not your time, and the Courts time, 
in that which serves to no other Purpose, than to gratify a
luxuriant way of Talking that you have. We have nothing to do
with his Book, you had as good tell me again, That there was a
parcel of people rambling about, pretending to my L. <font>Russel's</font> 
Ghost, and so we may answer all the Comedies in <font>England</font> .
Answer to the matter you are indicted for. Do you owne that
Paper?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on then, it does not become us to be    
impatient
to hear you, but we ought to advertise you, that you spend not
your time to no purpose, and do your self an Injury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say first, 'Tis not proved upon me: and   
secondly,
'Tis not a Crime if it be proved --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You began very materially in one thing: it 
is
material for you to apply your self to take off the Credibility of my
<pagebreak id="34" />
Lord <font>Howard</font> that is a Witness; call your Witnesses to that       
purpose,
or if you have any other point to take away the Credibility of
any other Witness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have seven or eight points of Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hear not one yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, my Lord, Conspiring to levy war is not
Treason, and <font>I</font> desire to have Counsel upon that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. J. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis not a Question. You had as good ask me, 
whether the first Chapter in <font>Littleton</font> be Law?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, <font>I</font> have neither made war, nor      
conspir'd to
levy war.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are still in a mistake, you shall not   
think that
we intend to dialogue with you, to let you know how far the
proof hath been given or not given, but when we come to direct
the Jury, then we shall observe how far the Law requires there
should be two witnesses. But whether there be such a proof, that
must be left to the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Wythens.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you agree the Conspiracy, I will   
tell you
my mind of it; I cannot give you my Opinion in Law, till the
Fact be stated.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Law alwayes arises upon a point of Fact;
there can be no doubt in point of Law, till there be a settlement
in point of Fact.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Holloway.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord has put you in a right way:  
The
Conspiracy is proved but by one Witness, if you have any thing
to take off his Credibility 'tis to the purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, my Lord, I do as little intend to    
mis-spend
my own Spirit, and your Time, as ever any man that came
before you. Now, my Lord, if you will make a Concatenation of
one thing, a Supposition upon Supposition, I would take all this
asunder, and shew, if none of these things are any thing in
themselves, there can be nothing joyned together. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take your own Method, Mr. <font>Sidney</font> ; but 
I say, if
you are a man of low Spirits and weak Body, 'tis a Duty
incumbent upon the Court, to exhort you not to spend your time
upon things that are not material.   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I think 'tis very material that a
whimsical imagination of a Conspiracy, should not pass for a real
Conspiracy of the Death of the King; besides, if these Papers were
found in my House, 'tis a Crime created since my Imprisonment,
and that cannot come in, for they were found since. My Lord, 
if these Papers are right, it mentions 200. and odd Sheets, and
these show neither Beginning nor Ending, and will you my
Lord, indict a man for Treason for scraps of Paper, found in his
House relating to an ancient Paper, intended as innocently as any
thing in the world, and piece and patch this to my Lord <font>Howards</font>
Discourse, to make this a Contrivance to kill the King: Then
my Lord, I think 'tis a Right of Mankind, and 'tis exercised by all
<pagebreak id="35" />
studious men, that they write in their own Closets what they
please for their own Memory, and no man can be answerable for
it, unless they publish it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray don't go away with that right of mankind, 
that
it is lawful for me to write what I will in my own Closet,
unless I publish it; I have been told, Curse not the King, not in
thy thoughts, not in thy Bed-Chamber, the Birds of the air will
carry it. I took it to be the duty of mankind, to observe that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have lived under the Inquisition --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God be thanked; we are governed by Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have lived under the Inquisition, and    
there is no
man in <font>Spain</font> can be tryed for Heresie --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Withins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Draw no Presidents from the          
Inquisition, here,
I beseech you Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must not endure men to talk, that by the    
right of
nature, every man may contrive mischief in his own Chamber,
and he is not to be punished, till he thinks fit to be called to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if you will take Scripture by     
pieces, you
will make all the Penmen of the Scripture blasphemous; you
may accuse <font>David</font> , of saying, There is no God; and accuse the 
Evangelists, of saying, Christ was a Blasphemer and a Seducer; and
the Apostles, That they were drunk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you, Mr. <font>Sidney</font> , if there be any     
part of it, that
explains the sense of it, you shall have it read; indeed we are
trifled with a little. 'Tis true, in Scripture 'tis said, there is no
God, and you must not take that alone, but you must say, the
fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. Now here is a
thing imputed to you in the Libel; if you can say, there is any
part that is in excuse of it, call for it. As for the purpose, 
whosoever does publish, that the King may be put in chains or
deposed, is a Traytor; but whosoever says, that none but Traytors
would put the King in Chains or depose him, is an honest man;
therefore apply <font> <foreign>ad idem</foreign> </font> , but don't let us make Excursions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If they will produce the whole, my Lord,    
then I
can see whether one part contradicts another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, if you have any Witnesses call them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Earl of <font>Anglesey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, in God's Name, stay till to morrow in  
things
that are pertinent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know of my Lord <font>Anglesey</font> ,  
what my
Lord <font>Howard</font> said to him concerning the Plot that was broken out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Anglesey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Concerning this Plot you are now questioned 
for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Plot for which my Lord <font>Russel</font> and I 
was in 
Prison.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Anglesey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Question I am asked, is, what my Lord
<font>Howard</font> said before the Tryal of my Lord <font>Russel</font> , concerning  
the
Plot; I suppose, this goes as a branch of that he was accused for.
I was then in the Country, when the Business was on foot, and
<pagebreak id="36" />
used to come to Town a day or two in the Week, living near in
<font>Hertfordshire</font> , and I understanding the Affliction my Lord of 
<font>Bedford</font> was in, I went to give my Lord a Visit, we having been
acquaintance of above fifty years standing, and bred together in
<font>Maudlin Colledge</font> in <font>Oxford</font> . When I came to my Lord of       
<font>Bedford</font> ,
and had administred that comfort that was fit for one Christian to
give another in that distress, I was ready to leave him, and my
Lord <font>Howard</font> came in. It was upon the Friday before my Lord
<font>Howard</font> was taken, he was taken (as I take it) upon Sunday or
Munday, my Lord <font>Howard</font> fell into the same Christian Office that
I had been just discharging, to compassionate my Lords
affliction, to use Arguments to comfort and support him under it, and
told him, he was not to be troubled, for he had a discreet, a
wife and a vertuous Son, and he could not be in any such Plot,
(I think that was the word he used at first, though he gave another
name to it afterward) and his Lordship might therefore well expect
a good Issue of that business, and he might believe his Son secure,
for he believed he was neither guilty, nor so much as to be
suspected. My Lord proceeded further, and did say, that he knew of
no such barbarous Design ( <font>I</font> think he called it so in the second
place) and could not charge my Lord <font>Russel</font> with it, nor any
body else. This was the effect of what my Lord <font>Howard</font> said at that
time, and <font>I</font> have nothing to say of my own knowledge more
than this; but to observe that <font>I</font> was present when the Jury did
put my Lord <font>Howard</font> particularly to it: what have you to say to
what my Lord <font>Anglesey</font> testifies against you? My Lord, <font>I</font> think
did in three several places, give a short account of himself, and
said it was very true, and gave them some further account why he
said it, and said, he should be very glad it might have been
advantagious to my Lord <font>Russel</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord of <font>Clare</font> , <font>I</font> desire to     
know of my Lord of
<font>Clare</font> , what my Lord <font>Howard</font> said concerning this Plot and me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Clare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, a little after Colonel <font>Sidney</font>  
was taken,
speaking of the Times, he said, that if ever he was questioned
again, he would never plead, the quickest dispatch was the best,
he was sure they would have his Life, though he was never so
innocent, and discoursing of the late Primate of <font>Armaghs</font> 
Prophesie; for my part, says he, <font>I</font> think the Persecution is      
begun, and <font>I </font>
believe it will be very sharp, but <font>I</font> hope it will be short, and  
<font>I</font>
said, <font>I</font> hoped so too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What answer did your Lordship give to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Clare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> have told you what <font>I</font> know, my     
Lord is too full
of discourse for me to answer all he says; but for Colonel           
<font>Sidney</font> ,
he did with great asseverations assert, that he was as innocent
as any man breathing, and used great Encomiums in his praise, 
and then he seemed to bemone his misfortune, which <font>I</font> thought
real, for never was any man more ingaged to another, than he
was to Colonel <font>Sidney</font> , <font>I</font> believe. Then <font>I</font> told, they     
talked of
<pagebreak id="37" />
Papers that were found, <font>I</font> am sure, says he, they can make
nothing of any Papers of his.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhen was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Clare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was at my house the beginning of       
<font>July</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long before my Lord <font>Howard</font> was     
taken?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Clare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About a week before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> would ask you, my Lord, upon your    
honour,
would not any man have said as much, that had been in the Plot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Clare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> can't tell, <font>I</font> know of no Plot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Philip Howard</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. J. Wythins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat do you ask him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat you heard my Lord <font>Howard</font> say     
concerning
this pretended Plot, or my being in it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Phil. Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, when the Plot first brake    
out, <font>I</font>
used to meet my Lord <font>Howard</font> very often at my Brothers house,
and coming one day from <font>Whitehall</font> , he asked me, what News?
I told him, my Lord, says <font>I</font> , there are abundance of people that
have confessed the horrid Design of murthering the King, and the
Duke. How, says he, is such a thing possible? says <font>I</font> , 'tis so;
they have all confessed it. Says he, do you know any of their
names? yes, says I, I have heard their Names. What are their
Names? says he, why, says I, Colonel <font>Romsey</font> , and Mr. <font>West</font> ,
and one <font>Walcott</font> and others, that are in the Proclamation (I can't
tell whether <font>Walcott</font> was in hold) says he, 'tis impossible such a
thing can be; says he, there are in all Countreys, people that
wish ill to the Government, and says he, I believe there are some
here; but says he, for any man of Honour, Interest or Estate, to
go about it, is wholly impossible. Says I, my Lord, so it is, and
I believe it. Says I, my Lord, do you know any of these
people? No, says he, none of them; only one day, says he, passing
through the <font>Exchange</font> , a man saluted me, with a Blemish upon
his Eye, and he embraced me, and wished me all happiness;
says he, I could not call to mind who this man was: but
afterwards, I recollected my self, that I met him at my Lord
<font>Shaftesburies</font> , and heard afterwards, and concluded his name to  
be --
his at whose house the King was to be assassinated --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rombald</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, <font>Rombald</font> . My Lord, May <font>I</font> ask,   
if my Lord
<font>Howard</font> be here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is there behind you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he will hear me. My Lord says <font>I</font> ,  
what does
your Lordship think of this business? says he, <font>I</font> am in a maze;   
says
<font>I</font> , if you will be ruled by me, you have a good opportunity to
Address to the King, and all the discontented Lords, as they
are called; and to shew your Detestation and Abhorrence of this
thing; for, says <font>I</font> , this will be a good means to reconcile all  
things.
Says he, you have put one of the best Notions in my Head that ever
was put. Says <font>I</font> , You are a very good Pen man, draw up the first
<pagebreak id="38" />
Address (and <font>I</font> believe, <font>I</font> was the first that mentioned an    
Address,
you have had many an one since, God send them good success)
says he, <font>I</font> am sorry my Lord of <font>Essex</font> is out of Town, he should
present it. But says <font>I</font> , Here is my Lord <font>Russel</font> , my Lord of 
<font>Bedford</font> ,
my Lord of <font>Clare</font> , all of you that are disaffected, and so
accompted, go about this business, and make the Nation happy, and King
happy. Says he, will you stay till <font>I</font> come back? Ay, says <font>I</font> , 
if you
will come in any time; but he never came back while <font>I</font> was there.
The next day, <font>I</font> think, my Lord <font>Russel</font> was taken, and <font>I</font>   
came and
found him at my Brother's House again (for there he was day and
night) says he, Cozen, what News? Says <font>I</font> , my Lord <font>Russel</font> is 
sent
to the <font>Tower</font> . We are all undone then, says he. Pray, says he, go
to my Lord Privy-Seal, and see if you can find <font>I</font> am to be taken  
up,
says he, <font>I</font> doubt 'tis a Sham-Plot, if it was a true Plot, <font>I</font>  
should fear
nothing; says <font>I</font> , what do you put me to go to my Lord Privy-Seal
for? He is one of the King's Cabinet Counsel, do you think he
will tell me? <font>I</font> won't go; but says <font>I</font> , if you are not        
Guilty, why
would you have me go to inquire? why, says he, because <font>I</font> fear
'tis not a true Plot, but a Plot made upon us, and therefore, says
he, there is no man free. My Lord, <font>I</font> can say no more as to that
time, (and there is no man that sits here, that wishes the King
better than <font>I</font> do.) The next thing <font>I</font> come to, is this, <font>I</font>  
came the third
day, and he was mighty sad and melancholy, that was when Col.
<font>Sidney</font> was taken: says I, why are you melancholy, because Col.
<font>Sidney</font> is taken? Says <font>I</font> , Col. <font>Sidney</font> was a man talked   
of before, why,
you were not troubled for my Lord <font>Russel</font> , that is of your Blood,
says he, <font>I</font> have that particular Obligation from Col.             
<font>Sidney</font> , that no
one man had from another. <font>I</font> have one thing to say farther, <font>I</font> 
pray
<font>I</font> may be rightly understood in what <font>I</font> have said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, you would have us undertake for all the  
people
that hear you? <font>I</font> think you have spoken very materially, and      
<font>I</font> will
observe it by and by to the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray call Doctor <font>Burnet</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. VValcott.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you ask Doctor <font>Burnet</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> have only to ask Dr. <font>Burnet</font> ,     
whether after the
News of this pretended Plot, my Lord <font>Howard</font> came to him? And
what he said to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Burnet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, the day after this Plot brake out   
my Lord
<font>Howard</font> came to see me, and upon some discourse of the Plot, with
Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, he protested he knew
nothing of any Plot, and believed nothing of it, and said, that he
looked upon it as a ridiculous thing.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>My Lord</font> Pagett <font>was sent for at the Prisoners request,
being in the Hall</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, <font>I</font> desire <font>Joseph Ducas</font> may  
be called, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (who
appeared, being a French-man.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> desire to know, whether he was not in 
my House
when my Lord <font>Howard</font> came thither, a little after <font>I</font> was made a 
Prisoner, and what he said upon it?
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ducas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, my Lord <font>Howard</font> came the day    
after the
Colonel <font>Sidney</font> was taken, and he asked me, Where was the Col.
<font>Sidney</font> ? and I said, he was taken by an Order of the King; and
he said, oh Lord! what is that for? I said, they have taken
Papers; he said, Is some Papers left? yes, Have they taken
something more? No, well you must take all the things out of the
house, and carry them to some you can trust: I dare trust no body,
says he; I will lend my Coach and Coach-man I said, if the Col.
<font>Sidney</font> will save his Goods; he save them, if not, 'tis no matter.
A little after the Lord <font>Howard</font> came in the House of Col.         
<font>Sidney</font> ,
about eleven a Clock at Night. When he was in, <font>I</font> told him, what
is this? They talk of a Plot to Kill the King and the Duke, and I
told him, they spake of one general Insurrection: and <font>I</font> told him
more, that <font>I</font> understood that Col. <font>Sidney</font> was sent into       
<font>Scotland</font> :
when my Lord <font>Howard</font> understood that, he said, God knows, <font>I</font>
know nothing of this, and <font>I</font> am sure if the Col. <font>Sidney</font> was 
concerned in the matter, he would tell me something, but <font>I</font> know
nothing. VVell my Lord, <font>I</font> told him, <font>I</font> believe you are not    
safe in
this house, there is more danger here than in another place.
Says he, <font>I</font> have been a Prisoner, and <font>I</font> had rather do any     
thing in
the World than be a Prisoner again.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then my Lord <font>Pagett</font> came into the Court.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Col. <font>Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray my Lord be pleased to tell the Court,  
if my
Lord <font>Howard</font> has said any thing to you concerning this late
pretended Plot, or my being any party in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Pagett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, <font>I</font> was <font>Subpoena'd</font> to come  
hither, and
did not know upon what accompt. <font>I</font> am obliged to say, my Lord
<font>Howard</font> was with me presently after the breaking out of this Plot,
and before his appearing in that part which he now Acts, he came
to me; and <font>I</font> told him, That <font>I</font> was glad to see him abroad, and
that he was not concerned in this disorder. He said, he had Joy
from several concerning it, and he took it as an injury to him, for
that it looked as if he were Guilty. He said, he knew nothing of
himself nor any body else. And though he was free in discourse, and
free to go into any Company indifferently; yet he said, he had not
seen any body that could say any thing of him, or give him
occasion to say any thing of any body else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Edward Howard</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ed. Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Sidney</font> , what have you to say   
to me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire you would ask Mr. <font>Edward 
Howard</font> the same thing, what Discourse he had with my Lord 
<font>Howard</font> about this Plot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Howard</font> , Mr. <font>Sidney</font> desires you to 
tell what
Discourse you had with my Lord <font>Howard</font> about this Plot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. E. Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have been for some time
very intimate with my Lord, not only upon the account of our
Alliance, but upon a strict intimacy and correspondence
<pagebreak id="40" />
of friendship, and I think, I was as much his as he
could expect from that Alliance. I did move him during this
time, to serve the King upon the most honourable account I could,
but that proved ineffectual: I pass that, and come to the business
here. Assoon as the Plot brake out, my Lord having a great
intimacy with me, expressed a great detestation, and surprizing in
himself to hear of it, wherein my Lord <font>Howard</font> assured me under
very great Asseverations, that he could neither accuse himself,
nor no man living. He told me moreover, That there were
certain persons of quality whom he was very much concerned for,
that they should be so much reflected upon or troubled, and he
condoled very much their condition both before and after they
were taken. My Lord, I believe in my Conscience, he did this
without any Mental Reservation, or Equivocation, for he had no
reason to do it with me. I add moreover, if I have any sense of my
Lords Disposition, I think if he had known any such thing, he
would not have stood his being taken, or made his Application
to the King in this manner, I am afraid not so suitable to his
quality.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No reflections upon any body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Howard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I reflect upon no body, I understand
where I am, and have a respect for the place; but since your
Lordship has given me this occasion, I must needs say, That that
Reproof that was accidentally given me at the Tryal of my Lord
<font>Russel</font> , by reason of a weak Memory, made me omit some
particulars I will speak now, which are these, and I think they are
material: My Lord upon the discourse of this Plot did further assure
me, that it was certainly a Sham, even to his knowledge; how, my
Lord, says I, do you mean a Sham? Why, says he, such an one,
Cozen, as is too black for any Minister of publick Employment to
have devised, but, says he, it was forged by People in the dark,
such as Jesuites and Papists, and, sayes he, this is my Conscience;
says I, my Lord, if you are sure of this thing, then pray, my
Lord, do that honourable thing that becomes your quality, that
is, give the King satisfaction as becomes you; pray make an
Address under your hand to the King, whereby you express your
Detestation and Abhorrence of this thing: says he, I thank you
for your Counsel, to what Minister, says he, shall I apply my self?
I pitched upon my Lord <font>Hallifax</font> , and I told him of my Lords
desire, and I remember my Lord <font>Howard</font> named the Duke of
<font>Monmouth</font> , my Lord of <font>Bedford</font> , the Earl of <font>Clare</font> , and  
he said he was
sure they would do it; that he was sure of their Innocence, and would
be glad of the occasion: and I went to my L. <font>Hallifax</font> , and told 
him
that my Lord was willing to set it under his hand, his detestation
of this Plot, and that there was no such thing to his knowledge.
My Lord <font>Hallifax</font> very worthily received me, says he, I will
<pagebreak id="41" />
introduce it; but my Lord <font>Russel</font> being taken, this was laid
aside, and my Lord gave this reason. For, says he, there
will be so many People taken, they will be hindred. I must
needs add from my Conscience, and from my Heart before
God and Man, that if my Lord had spoken before the King,
sitting upon his Throne, abateing for the solemnity of the
presence I could not have more believed him, from that
assurance he had in me. And I am sure from what I have said,
if I had the Honour to be of this Gentleman's Jury I would not 
believe him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That must not be suffered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You ought to be bound to your good
behaviour for that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Jury are bound by their Oaths to go
according to their Evidence, they are not to go by men's conjectures.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Howard,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May I go my Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Howard</font> desires he may stay,   
we shall
make use of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I spake of a Mortgage that I had  
of my 
Lord <font>Howard</font> , I don't know whether it is needful to be proved;
but it is so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Howard,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then my Lord here is the other point, He   
is under
the fear, that he dare not but say what he thinks will conduce
towards the gaining his Pardon; and that he hath expressed, that he
could not have his Pardon, but he must first do this drudgery of
swearing. I need not say, that his Son should say, That he was
sorry his Father could not get his Pardon unless he did swear against
some others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mr. <font>Blake</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (who appeared) </nonSpeech><dialogue> My 
Lord, I desire
he may be asked, whether my Lord <font>Howard</font> did not tell him that
he could not get his Pardon yet, and he could ascribe it to nothing,
but that the drudgery of swearing must be over first.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then my Lord Chief Justice asked the Question.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Blake,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I am very sorry I should be called   
to give a
publick account of a private Conversation, how it comes about I
don't know. My Lord sent for me about six Weeks ago, to come
and see him. I went and we talked of News, I told him I heard
no body had their Pardon; but he that first discovered the Plot,
he told me no; but he had his Warrant for it. And, says he, I
have their Word and Honour for it; but says he I will do nothing
in it till I have further order, and says he, I hear nothing of it,  
and
I can ascribe it to no other reason; but I must not have my pardon
till the drudgery of swearing is over. These words my Lord said,
I believe my Lord won't deny it.
<pagebreak id="42" />

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then Mr.</font> Sidney <font>called Mr.</font> Hunt <font>and</font> Burroughs,
<font>but they did not appear</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a hard case they don't appear, One of 
them was
to prove that my Lord <font>Howard</font> said he could not have his Pardon
till he had done some other Jobs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't help it, If you had come for        
assistance from
the Court I would willingly have done what I could.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then</font> Col. Sidney <font>mentioned the Duke of</font> Buckingham, <font>but
he was informed he was not subpoena'd</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>Grace Tracy</font> and <font>Elizabeth       
Penwick</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (who
appeared) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you only, what my Lord <font>Howard</font> said to you at my
House concerning the Plot, and my being in it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tracy,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir he said, that he knew nothing of a Plot he 
protested, and he was sure <font>Col. Sidney</font> knew nothing of it. And   
he said
If you knew any thing of it, he must needs know of it, for he,
knew as much of your concerns as any one in the World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he take God to Witness upon it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tracy,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he desire my Plate at my House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tracy,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell that, he said the Goods might be    
sent to his
House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Penwick.</font> What did my Lord <font>Howard</font>   
say in your
hearing concerning the pretended Plot, or my Plate carrying
away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Penwick,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When he came he asked for your Honour; and they
said your Honour was taken away by a man to the Tower for the
Plot, and then he took God to Witness he knew nothing of it, and
believed your Honour did not neither. He said he was in the Tower
two years ago, and your Honour, he believed, saved his Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Col. Sidney,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he desire the Plate?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Penwick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, And said it should be sent to his House to
be secured. He said it was only Malice.
