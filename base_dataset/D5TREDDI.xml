   <nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give an Account what you know
of this Matter, and speak the Truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An't please you, my Lord, on
<font>Saturday</font> the 1st of <font>May</font> . --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak slow and deliberately, that the
Court and the Jury may hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An't please you, my Lord, on
<font>Saturday</font> , the 1st of <font>May</font> last, I and my Father were going
<pagebreak id="407" />
up <font>Staines</font> River, to catch a Dish of Fish in <font>Staines</font> Moor,
in the Parish of <font>Staines</font> , with a Casting-net; we fish'd all
the Way up till we came to this Ground?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In whose Possession was the
Ground?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was Mr. <font>Samuel Sylvester's</font> 
Meadow; we were turning back again, an't please you
my Lord, in order to go Home; my Father he carried the
Net upon his Arm, and the String was fastened to his
Arm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, as you were coming back
from fishing, what happened then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By that Time we had got half way
in the Meadow, we saw <font>Joseph Redding</font> and Mr. <font>Annesley</font>
running, and <font>Joseph Redding</font> out run Mr. <font>Annesley</font> , and
came up to my Father first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they came up what was
the first Thing they did?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Redding</font> took my Father by the
Collar, and demanded the Net, and he refused to deliver
the Net.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see him take him by the Collar?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What became of the Net afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Eggleston.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Father threw it into the 
River.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far were you from the
River then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was about two Yards from the
River. After the Net was thrown into the River, 
<font>Annesley</font> came up with his Gun, and swore, God damn
your Blood, deliver your Net, or you are a dead Man;
and he fir'd off before he received any Answer from
my Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Manner did <font>Annesley</font>
hold his Gun?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In this Manner, (pointing the Gun
strait forward) holding it about Breast high, stooping a
little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was the Gun to
your Father when he fir'd it?
<pagebreak id="408" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was close to my Father's Side,
he put the Gun between <font>Redding</font> and my Father, and
shot directly into his left Side, here, (holding his Hand
to his Hip) he had a Plate Button there which was bruised
to Pieces; then my Father said, you Rogue, what have
you done, I am a dead Man, and dropp'd immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did <font>Annesley</font> say before
he fir'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He swore if he did not deliver
the Net he was a dead Man, and then fir'd immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you do after you
heard your Father say he was a dead Man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I took a Knife out of my Pocket
to cut the String of the Net: And <font>Annesley</font> said, you
Rogue, I will knock out your Brains too, and held
up the butt End of his Gun; upon that I jump'd 
into the Stream, and cut the String, and drew the Net
over to the other Side of the River: then says 
<font>Annesley</font> , the Rogue has got the Net, let us go to the 
other Side after him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did you see when you
came on the other Side of the River?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw <font>John Bettesworth</font> , <font>John    
Fisher</font>
and <font>John Bowles</font> , and when <font>Annesley</font> and <font>Redding</font> saw
these three Men they ran away directly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near were <font>Bettesworth</font> ,
<font>Fisher</font> and <font>Bowles</font> to you, before <font>Annesley</font> and <font>Redding</font>
ran away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As soon as I got on the other
Side of the River, they saw these three Men coming,
and then they ran away; and <font>Bettesworth</font> , <font>Fisher</font> , and
<font>Bowles</font> came through the River to the Side where my
Father lay dead; they came from one Side to the 
other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you do then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They bid me get a Surgeon;
so I went to one <font>Charles Cole</font> , a Surgeon at <font>Staines</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you came to <font>Staines</font> , did
you meet with <font>Cole</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: And I told him my Father
was shot, and I believed he was dead or dying, but he
<pagebreak id="409" />
never came near my Father; then I went to <font>Russel</font> the
Constable, and he took some Townsmen with him,
and went to old Mr. <font>Redding's</font> House, at <font>Yeovely</font> Farm,
to search for the Man that kill'd my Father; we beset
the House all round, and found <font>James Annesley</font> hid up
in a Corner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long were you there 
before he was found?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was there about a quarter of an
Hour, or a little more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you present then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: I was there all the Time;
then, an't please you my Lord, they pull'd him
down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was he hid?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was hid in a Place which is
five or six Foot from the Ground, where they put
old Iron and any Sort of Lumber, 'tis a boarded Place
or Room over the Wash-house; a Place where the 
Women makes Medicines for sore Eyes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there a Chimney in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he standing up or lying
down, or how was he when he was found?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know, for I did not see
him till he was pull'd down; he was carried in a
Chair into the Yard, and sat there about a quarter
of an Hour, and then was put into the Cart that brought
up my Father, and was carried to the Round House
at <font>Staines</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is all you know, is
it not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An't please you, my Lords, I can
tell you a great deal more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who pull'd him down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this Wound the Occasion
of your Father's Death?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on, you say you have 
other Things to say.
<pagebreak id="410" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He lay in the Round-House all
Night, the next Day <font>Annesley</font> the Prisoner and I,
went in a Cart to a Justice at <font>Hounslow</font> , and there
as one <font>Mac Kercher</font> there, who said to me --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Mac Kercher</font> said is no Evidence 
against the Prisoners.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will let this alone a
little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you prove he was any ways employ'd
as an Agent by the Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe we can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Foreman of the Jury.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, please to ask
him whether there was no Quarrel, Bustle, or 
Strugling, between <font>Annesley</font> , <font>Redding</font> , and <font>Egglestone</font> , 
before
the Gun went off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no Quarrel or Jostling,
my Father never gave him an ill Word. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did your Father make no Resistance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no Resistance at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there no Jostling, nor any Thing else
pass'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: <font>Redding</font> took my Father
by the Collar, and <font>Annesley</font> came up in the mean
Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What happen'd between your Father and
<font>Redding</font> before <font>Annesley</font> came up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He demanded his Net.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought you said there was some 
jostling?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No other Jostling than laying his
Hand upon my Father's Collar, but my Father never
laid his Hand upon him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near were you when <font>Redding</font>
laid his Hand upon your Father?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About a Yard and an half off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say he shot off the Gun, I ask
you what you mean by shooting off the Gun?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why he fir'd the Gun to shoot my
Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you mean by shooting off
the Gun?
<pagebreak id="411" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He came up directly, as if he was
going to shoot a Dog.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see him draw the Trigger of
the Gun?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Gun cock'd before he came
up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you say that it was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know that I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray was any body present at the
Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no body near but
<font>Bettesworth</font> , <font>Fisher</font> , and <font>Bowles</font> , nor no body came up.

Money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he offer'd to settle 50 <font>l.</font> a
Year on me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I was at <font>Laleham</font> , the next
Day after my Father's Death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We went to a Justice's at 
<font>Brentford</font> , but he not being at home, we put up at the
Red-Lion there, and while we were there, Sir <font>Thomas
Reynel</font> came in and ordered us to go to <font>Laleham</font> ; 
accordingly we went to one Mr. <font>Lee's</font> into a little Room, and
there was <font>Jack Lane</font> , Mrs. <font>Chester</font> , and the Prisoner;
Young <font>John Lane</font> offered me 100 l. a Year, but the
Prisoner said he could not settle 100 l. a Year upon
me, for he had more to do for, but he said he would
settle 50 l. a Year on me: this was said in the 
Presence of the Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he mention what he would give
you 50 <font>l.</font> a Year for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I should not come in as an
Evidence against him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is the Reason you did
not comply with his Offer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told them I would not sell my
Father's Blood at any Rate.
<pagebreak id="412" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (The Council for the Prosecutor having done with this
Witness, he was Cross-examined as follows.</font> </nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Redding</font> stood between <font>Annesley</font> 
and
my Father, and had him hold by the Collar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know <font>William Duffel</font> , and had not you
some Talk with him about the Manner of your Father's 
Death?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never saw him, nor had any
talk with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any Conversation with one <font>John 
Dalton</font> , at <font>Laleham</font> , where you say you was offered that
Money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John Egglestone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came out of the Room to ask
him whether I should take the Money or not; for
he said, I had better take the Money, and not hang
the Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you said nothing at that Time about the

Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Business was you of, when your Father
died?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I work'd with my Father as a Carpenter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you was brought up a Carpenter, how came
<font>Williams</font> to find you out for a Servant?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you liv'd with him?

you at the <font>Oxford-Arms</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did draw something of a Note, but I
tore it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What made you tear the Note?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I did not like his Proceedings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What were the Proceedings you did not like?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know, I did not understand
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, did not you read the Note before you
tore it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not.
<pagebreak id="414" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came the Note to be wrote? Did he say
nothing to you about writing of a Note before he
wrote it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing at all, but he desired me to copy
it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say to you when he desired you to
copy the Note?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing; it lay upon the Table, and I
tore it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you tear it for, if you had not read it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because it was about Things that I did not
know what they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not he desire you to copy the Note?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went for my own Fancy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not send up Word to him you was sure
he would be glad to see you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe I might.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Reason, for which you thought
Mr. <font>Annesley</font> would be glad to see you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, I was willing to see him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never in speaking of your Father's Death,
say that it was done accidentally?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know that I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never say to <font>Keating</font> that you were to
have 200 <font>l.</font> or had a Promise, or that you were to
have Security, and from whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, I never did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you give the same Account with respect to
the holding of the Gun as you do now, before the
Coroner's Inquest, and before the Justice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am sure I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you give two Accounts before the
Coroner's Inquest; part at one time, and went out, and the
<pagebreak id="415" />
Remainder when you came in again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never say that the Butt End of the Gun
was up to his Shoulder, and the muzzled Point
downward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never say any Thing to any body of
the Manner of Mr. <font>Annesley's</font> drawing one of his Feet
back?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you tell which of his Legs he drew back?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I cannot tell which he drew back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never say which?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To No-body?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serjeant <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said you went to the 
<font>Oxford-Arms</font> with <font>Keating</font> , and there was something talk'd
of relating to a Note, was there any Offer made to you
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You talk'd of a Paper that was
tore, do you know the Contents of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eggl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, I do not.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>John Bettesworth</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell us what you know of this
Matter, and where you were when you heard a Gun
fir'd on the first of <font>May</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Thomas Egglestone</font> and his Son were a Fishing;
I was 169 Yards some odd Inches from the River as
near as I could measure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Ground was it in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were in the Ground called Mr.
<font>Silvester's</font> Rents.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are there many Hedges on the
Side of the River where the Deceased was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were a pretty many Willows, but any
body might see through them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you see?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw <font>Joseph Redding</font> and Mr. <font>Annesley</font> come 
over the Hedge.
<pagebreak id="416" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Hedge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Hedge that parted Mr. <font>Sylvester's</font> Ground
from Mr. <font>Redding's</font> Ground, I do not know whether one
of them did not come over the Stile, then they both
ran after <font>Egglestone</font> , and his Son: young <font>Redding</font> came
up first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he lay hold of <font>Egglestone</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether he laid his Hand upon his Collar,
or what, I cannot tell; but the Boy run away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was it laid hold of the Shoulder or Collar
of the Deceased?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Redding</font> , I saw his Hand upon the Shoulder,
or Collar of the Deceased, but I cannot say positively,
whether he had him by the Shoulder or Collar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it after that, that
<font>Annesley</font> came up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Boy was gone but a little way from his
Father, and when Mr. <font>Annesley</font> came up to his Father,
he came back again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was he to his Father
when this Accident happen'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say how near he was to his Father,
I believe two or three Yards off. -- <font>Annesley</font> and
<font>Redding</font> come up almost together, but <font>Annesley</font> came up
after him, the Gun went off after he came up: I saw
the Smoak and heard the Fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As you were 169 Yards off, how
came you to come up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Boy called to us and said his Father was
killed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who came along with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Bowles</font> , and <font>John Fisher</font> , came to the
River just against the Place where Mr. <font>Egglestone</font> lay,
and we could not get over there without being thus
high (putting his Hand to his Middle) but we went
over in a shallower Place a little farther.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were <font>Annesley</font> and <font>Redding</font> there
when you came over?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they run away before that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was <font>Egglestone</font> dead or alive when
you came up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was not dead, but he could not speak. I
<pagebreak id="417" />
desired the Boy to go for a Surgeon, and he went away
directly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who came first to the River?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you all three come up
together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I was coming rather before the Boy cried
out, for I saw the Man drop, I could not see the Boy
for a good while, for he was in the River, and he cut
the Net from his Father's Arm, as he says, I did not
see that; but I saw the Boy come cross the River, and
when I came up I saw that the Net was brought cross
the River.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did <font>Egglestone</font> lie?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bettesworth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He lay upon his Face; I lifted up his
Head, he groan'd pretty much, but he could not
speak: I sent the Boy for a Surgeon, but no Surgeon
came.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you at the Apprehending            
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Appprehending</comment> of 
the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Place was it the Prisoner
was in when he was taken?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a Sort of a wash house, a back-House:
he was in a Place where they throw up Hoops and
Iron, and any Sort of old Lumber? I saw him lie upon
his Face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who took him down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they do with him then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They carried him to the Round-house at
<font>Staines</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you came to the Place where you lay
he had hid himself, did he come down of his own accord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you heard the Gun go off, whose
Hand was it in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Annesley's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know the Position of the Gun
when it went off?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I do not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe any Struggle between
<pagebreak id="418" />
<font>Annesley</font> , <font>Redding</font> , and the Deceased?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No other than their striving to take the Net
away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any Thing that passed in the
Round-House? -- did the Prisoner say any Thing
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, the Prisoner said he desired to be kill'd
out of the way, for being accessary to such an innocent
Man's Death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he tell you besides?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he would have gone Home for more
Men, but <font>Joseph Redding</font> would not let him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he want more Men for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To take away the Net.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Answer did he say <font>Redding</font> made him to
that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was, that he said we can do it well
enough.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (The Prosecutor's Council having done with this
Witness, he was Cross-examined as follows.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see Mr. <font>Annesley</font> and <font>Redding</font> before  
they
came up to the Deceased?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe Mr. <font>Annesley</font> making any use of
his Gun before he came up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him offer to shoot at a Crow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was that before this Accident
happened?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe about Half an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Crow flying or sitting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Flying.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe whether he did Shoot at the
Crow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not then, he did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far were you off then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About as far, I think, as when I saw the Man
kill'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Position of the Gun when you saw
him come up running.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was on this manner, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (holds it as if the Gun
was with the Muzzle hanging a little slanting towards
the Ground.) </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="419" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you saw <font>Annesley</font> and <font>Redding</font> in  
the
other Ground, before they came into that Ground which
belongs to <font>Silvester</font> -- what were they doing there, were
they Standing, Sitting, or what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were Sitting or Lying under the Hedge,
I cannot tell which.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what Purpose do you imagine they were Sitting
or Lying there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say that. I may imagine they
came to take the Net away, I cannot imagine any
Thing else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Boy go into the River?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and it was just after his Father was shot.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>John Fisher</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know the Prisoners at the Bar?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know Mr. <font>Redding</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe this to be the Person who was 
along with Mr. <font>Redding</font> at the Time that Mr. <font>Egglestone</font>
was kill'd? -- Look at Mr. <font>Annesley's</font> Face, and see
whether that is the Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see Mr. <font>Annesley</font> , but I cannot say that he
is the Man; I saw two Men lie under the Hedge a
considerable Time, and saw a Piece in one of their
Hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In which Ground were they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe in Mr. <font>Redding's</font> Ground.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Ground was <font>Egglestone</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was in <font>Silvester's</font> Ground. <font>Bettesworth</font>
called to me, and said there is <font>Redding</font> running after
<font>Egglestone</font> , and <font>Redding</font> laid hold of <font>Egglestone</font> , the
Deceased, and then came up the other with a Piece: I
cannot say whether he touched him or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Manner did <font>Redding</font> lay hold of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say, I was at such a Distance; but
I thought he laid hold of his Shoulder.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Egglestone</font> make away from him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, for he knew he was out of the Bounds
that he ought to have been fishing in; and there was a
sort of a Struggle to take away the Net; and I thought
that <font>Redding</font> and the other Person did both snatch at the
Net, and then the Gun went off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In whose Hand was the Gun?
<pagebreak id="420" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in <font>Redding's</font> Hand, but in the Hand of
the other Person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not you attentive at that Time, to see
in what Manner he carried the Gun?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be this Way, or that Way, I 
cannot say whether he had the Gun against his Shoulder
or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was he to the Deceas'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very nigh, I believe not above the Length
of a Gun?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see <font>John Egglestone</font> by, when
you first came up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was near the River.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear the Boy cry out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he said his Father was killed; -- he
saw me, and called me by my Name, and said my Father
is killed, and I came directly cross the River.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then became of <font>Annesley</font> , and the other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They ran away; we halloo'd after them,
but I did not think the Man was shot, though I saw
the Smoak and Fire of the Gun.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who went over the River first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were all three together almost, I cannot
tell who was over first, but I believe I was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was said to the Boy then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing; only to go and get a Surgeon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who bid him go?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Somebody did, I did not  I believe it was
<font>Bettesworth</font> , and the Boy ran away directly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Surgeon brought there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who came there afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Silvester</font> : he saw the Deceased lying
upon the Ground, but he was not there when the 
Murder was committed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in the House when he was taken?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you with him before the Justice of Peace?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was examined, but I was not present when
the other Witnesses were examined.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distance was there between you and
the Deceased when the Gun went off?
<pagebreak id="421" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Hundred and Sixty-nine Yards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you include the Breadth of the River?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes I do.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (Cross-Examined.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you think that both <font>Redding</font> and          
<font>Annesley</font>
snatch'd at the Net?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think it was possible for you to hear
what passed between them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could not hear one Word.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would ask you, whether young <font>Egglestone</font> , before
he was examined by Sir <font>Thomas Reynell</font> , did not say
to you he believed the Gun did go off by Accident?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he believed it was not done wilfully.
He had Money offered him, in my hearing, by <font>John
Lane</font> ; Mr. <font>Annesley</font> said he could not give him 100 <font>l.</font> a
Year; but he would give him 50 <font>l.</font> for he had others
to do for; then, said the Boy, I will not sell my
Father's Blood; I believe he was in Liquor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you say to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said your Father is dead; the Money will
do you good; do not swear any thing against him, if
you think it was done accidentally; he said the Money
will do me good if I had it; I believe the Gentleman
did not do it wilfully.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you not some Conversation together, after
his Examination before the Justice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I asked him, after he was examined, what
he had done; and how he could swear against him,
when he had said so and so to me; said he, I do not
know any Thing of the Matter;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know Mr. <font>Williams</font> the Clergyman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you make a Declaration of this to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; I said to Mr. <font>Williams</font> , that          
<font>Egglestone</font>
told me he really believed that the Gentleman did not
do it wilfully.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not he say it was wilfully done as
you were going along to the Justice's?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fisher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All the Way he went, he said, he believ'd
he did it wilfully, but after the Prisoner had been talking
with him, he said he believed it was not done wilfully.
<pagebreak id="422" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Samuel Sylvester</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Deceas'd after he
was Dead?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He lay dead on the Ground that I rent, near
the River-side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know how he came by
his Death?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was going up to look after my Ground, and
when I came within 200 Yards or thereabouts of it, I
met 3 Men, who told me old <font>Egglestone</font> was killed; and
said, there he lies; I saw several People there, and so I
went up and saw him lie dead there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know where the Prisoner
<font>Annesley</font> was taken?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was taken in a back Building belonging to
Mr. <font>Redding's</font> House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear him say any thing at that
Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not hear him say any Thing, I believe
he was in a Fit, for he trembled and fell down behind
the Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you at <font>Laleham</font> before the
Justice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes I was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had not the Boy been drinking,
and did he not sleep before he went into the Justice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe he did, for about 3 quarters of an
Hour, which refreshed him.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you not received Money to pay the
Witnesses for attending here on this last Cause the last
Sessions, and from whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I paid some of them, I think it was
by Mr. <font>Giffard's</font> Direction who subpoena'd me up; I
asked him who was to pay me, he said I should be paid
half a Crown a Day for my Time, which was as much
as he thought I could earn at my Business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Business is this <font>Giffard</font> of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is a Stranger to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know who he said he was employed by?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he was concerned for the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know Mr. <font>Williams</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
<pagebreak id="423" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Business does young <font>Egglestone</font> follow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe he draws Beer now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you known him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have known him 5 or 6 Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Business was he bred to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes he would be out at Service, and
sometimes he would be with his Father in the Business of
a Carpenter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where does he draw Beer now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it is at Mr. <font>Williams's</font> , at the   
white-Horse
in <font>Piccadilly</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you had any Conversation with him about
this Affair?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been at his House in <font>Piccadilly</font> since
this Business has been in hand, but never had any talk
with him about this Trial.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not this <font>Williams</font> down before the Justice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see him at <font>Staines</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, about a Week after the Accident
happened.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seen the Boy, <font>Egglestone</font> , there since?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Syl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, has he lived with <font>Williams</font> ever since?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you whether you have not seen him at
<font>Williams's</font> House every time you have been there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sylvest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I believe I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper</font> then said, they would rest the Evidence
here; and he hoped it had fully made out the
Charge against the Prisoners; that the Ground where the
Man was killed being the Property of <font>Sylvester</font> , the
Prisoners were Trespassers by coming into it, and therefore
answerable for the Consequences. That as to Mr. 
<font>Annesley</font> , there was not only implied, but express Malice
proved upon him, for that after he had killed the Father;
he was for beating out the Son's Brains, only because they
would not let him and the other Prisoner run away with
their Net.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Court.</nonSpeech><dialogue>  Mr. <font>Annesley</font> , you are indicted in a very
unhappy Case, what have you to say for yourself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Annesley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I am very unable to make a
proper Defence, having by the Cruelty of those, whose
<pagebreak id="424" />
Duty it was to protect me, been deprived of the
Advantages of an Education I was entituled to by my Birth.
   All I know of the melancholy Accident in Question is,
that on the unfortunate Day mention'd in the Indictment,
I went out with my Gun, in Company with my innocent
Fellow-Prisoner, to shoot Sparrows, as I usually did. As
we were going along, Mr. <font>Redding</font> , who is Game-keeper
to the Lord of the Manor, saw some People a Poaching
within the Royalty, upon which he proposed to go and
seize their Nets; I follow'd him, the deceas'd threw the
Net into the River, and the Boy jump'd in to pull it
across, to prevent which, I stoop'd to lay hold of one of
the Ropes that trailed upon the Ground, and at the 
same Instant, the fatal Instrument I had in my other
Hand, hanging by my Side, went off without my
Knowledge, and to my great Grief as well as Surprize.
My Behaviour immediately after the Accident, was, I
hope inconsistent with a Temper that could murder a
Man I had never seen before, without one Word of
Provocation.
   Whatever may be the Determination of your 
Lordship and the Jury, great as the Misfortunes of my Life
have been, I shall always consider this unfortunate 
Accident as the greatest of them all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Court.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Redding</font> , what have you to say for 
yourself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J. Redding.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I am Game-keeper to Sir
<font>John Dolben</font> , Lord of the Manor of <font>Yeoveney</font> . On the
first of <font>May</font> last, in the Afternoon, Mr. <font>Annesley</font> and I
went out a walking; we saw a Crow, and Mr. <font>Annesley</font>
made an Offer to shoot at her, but I called to him not
to fire, for that she was too far off: Soon after I saw
<font>Egglestone</font> and his Son a Fishing with a Casting-Net,
upon which I said to Mr. <font>Annesley</font> , I would go and
endeavour to take their Net away, as it was my Duty to
do; accordingly I went up to the deceas'd and demanded
the Net, which he refused to deliver to me, and threw it
into the River, one End of the String being about his Arm;
I then laid hold of the String, and pulled, whilst the
Boy endeavoured to draw it cross the River, and
presently I heard the Gun go off (my Back being towards Mr.
<font>Annesley</font> ) and saw the Man fall down. -- I said to Mr.
<font>Annesley</font> , I hoped he had not shot the Man, he said no,
<pagebreak id="425" />
but turning up the Flap of his Coat, we saw he was shot!
upon which Mr. <font>Annesley</font> cried out, what shall I do;
and expressed so much Concern, that I am sure it was
quite an accidental Thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hume Campbell</font> , of Council for the Prisoners, said,
that altho' he knew by the Course of the Court at the
<font>Old Bailey</font> , he was not at Liberty to observe upon the
Prosecutor's Evidence, yet he apprehended, that for the
Ease of the Court, he might just open the Nature of the
Defence, without making any Observations upon it.
   That the Defence which the Prisoners insisted upon
was, that the Gun went off meerly by Accident; that
<font>Redding</font> was Game-keeper to Sir <font>John Dolben</font> , Lord of
the Manor of <font>Yeoveney</font> , and had a proper and legal
Deputation for seizing of Nets and other Engines, for
destroying of Game. That the deceas'd and his Son were
poaching with a casting-Net within the Manor; that Mr.
<font>Annesley</font> went in Aid of the Game-keeper; and therefore
the Prisoners being about a lawful Act, were not so
much as Trespassers, and the Death that was the
accidental Consequence of that Act, would, in Point of Law,
make Mr. <font>Annesley</font> guilty only of Chance Medley.</nonSpeech>

Steward to Sir <font>John Dolben</font> , as Lord of the Manor,
under the Dean and Chapter of <font>Westminster</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know this to be a
Manor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Staples.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have the Grant of the Manor from
the Dean and Chapter in my Pocket.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are there any Copy-holders?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Staples.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have admitted some
Copyholders? I know it to be a Manor, because I have held one
Court there for my Father, and have seen him hold
several.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is there any Mansion-House
belonging to this Manor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Staples.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is a Mansion-House belonging to
it, which I think is the House that Mr. <font>Redding</font> lives in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Court was it you held there?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Edmonds.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I went to the Clerk of the
Peace for the County of <font>Middlesex</font> , and heard him
acknowledge this to be his Hand, and that it was entered
according to the Act of Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Entry of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Edmonds.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said it was entred, and

his right Hand, hanging down near the Pocket a few
Inches from his Body, almost upon a Level) </nonSpeech><dialogue> he had it in
one Hand, as I have the Sword now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he express himself concerned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Red.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was so concerned, that he did not run

ten Pole, before he fell down and beat himself thus

to be Game-keeper?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Red.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because they robbed me daily.

the Son of <font>Thomas Egglestone</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you ever had any Conversation with him
about this Matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: He said that as he and his Father
were Fishing, they saw the Prisoner, <font>Redding</font> , coming
up; that he desired his Father to give him the Net,
and he would run away with it, but his Father would
not let him; that then <font>Redding</font> came up and
demanded the Net; that <font>Thomas Egglestone</font> , said he should not
have it, and then threw the Net into the River, and
<pagebreak id="428" />
in the mean Time, the other Gentleman came up and
shot him; that <font>John Egglestone</font> jump'd into the River,
and cut the Line of the Net to pull it out on the other
Side; and that when the Gun went off and his Father
dropped down, Mr. <font>Redding</font> said to the other Gentleman,
<font>Lord Sir, what have you done</font> ! and then they both run
Home: Mr. <font>Abraham Egglestone</font> , who was present, asked
him if he saw Mr. <font>Annesley</font> pull the Trigger of the
Gun; and <font>John Egglestone</font> answered, that he could not
tell. I asked him if there was any Quarrel or Words
that had passed between them, and he said no. -- I said
it was very surprizing to me, that this Gentleman should
come and shoot his Father and nothing more pass
between them; I then asked him in what manner he held
the Gun; he had a Stick in his Hand, and shewed in
what manner the Gun was held in his Hand, thus, (in
his right Hand, the Arm hanging down near the Pocket,
some Inches from his Body, and near upon a Level;
which was the same manner that old <font>Redding</font> said the
Gun was held) I asked if he thought he did it wilfully,
he said, he could not tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see this <font>John Egglestone</font> before, for
he says he knows nothing of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have known him these Eight Years, and he
has been frequently at my House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Character has he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say much in his behalf; his Father
could not manage him at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Business did he follow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Father was a Carpenter, and he worked
with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did he leave <font>Staines</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soon after this Accident happened.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where has he been ever since?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have seen him at the <font>White Horse</font> in
<font>Piccadilly</font> ; and I heard at <font>Staines</font> , that he was sent for to
<font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was present at this Conversation besides
<font>Egglestone</font> and you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nobody but Mr. <font>Abraham Egglestone</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say he could not say it was
wilfully done, did he say it was accidentally done?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he did not say it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you apprehend he had hold of the
Gun by the Barrel near the Lock?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Duff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understood by <font>Egglestone's</font> manner of holding
the Stick, that he meant that Mr. <font>Annesley</font> had hold of
the Gun about the middle of the Barrel.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On the <font>Sunday</font> , when the Prisoner at the Bar
was carried to <font>Laleham</font> to be Examined, I went there:
<font>John Egglestone</font> came to the Door, and called me out of
the Room where I was, and said he wanted to speak
with me. When I came out, he said he wanted to ask
my Advice concerning this Accident: I said, I wonder
you should ask my Advice, when you have Relations to
advise with; he said, I thought fit to ask you, as you
are my Master. While we were talking, <font>Samuel Sylvester</font>
came out, and said, I was persuading the Boy to sell
his Father's Blood; the Boy said, what do you mean
you Fool you, my Master is persuading me to no such
Thing. I then asked him, whether he thought it was
Accidentally done or not; he said, he believed it was
Accidental, rather than any other thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Character has the Boy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was very irregular, and used to lie out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Trade are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a Butcher.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say he has a bad Character;
do you think he would forswear himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can say nothing to that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any talk of Money
then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, the Boy said he had been offered Money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you say, he said he would not sell his Father's
Blood?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I said <font>Samuel Sylvester</font> came and said I was
persuading him to sell his Father's Blood; and the Boy
said my Master did not persuade me to any such Thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you say to him 
afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told him he had lost his Father, and had no
Friend to take Care of him, and he knew best what he
had to do.
<pagebreak id="430" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you say it was better to take Money,
than Hang the Man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dalt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I said, I thought by what he told me,
that the Man was in no danger of being Hang'd, and
therefore he had better take the Money than endeavour
to Hang a Man, that he thought did not do it designedly.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I drove the Chaise, to the <font>Grey-hound</font> at
<font>Laleham</font> ; I went up to young <font>Egglestone</font> , and asked him
how this unfortunate Thing happen'd; he said he
believed it was accidental, for he did not believe any

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing with respect to the Net?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think he said Mr. <font>Annesley</font> was stooping to

Gun?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desired him to shew me how Mr. <font>Annesley</font>
held the Gun; he took my Whip in his Hand and held
it so, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (which was much the same Position as <font>Redding</font> and
<font>Duffell</font> said he held it in) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it was rather nearer
the handle than the middle of the Whip that he held it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Wound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understood it was somewhere about the Hip.

have shot him there, if he had held the Gun that way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think he could not have shot him there, if
he had held it any other way. My Lord, I had forgot
to mention one Thing. After this, <font>Egglestone</font> spoke to
Mr. <font>Annesley</font> the Prisoner, and shook Hands with him;
and <font>Egglestone</font> said he was very sorry for what had
happened, but said he did not think he did it designedly,
and then drank a Glass of Wine to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they shake Hands, or drink the Wine first?
<pagebreak id="431" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Both at the same Time as near as could be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you whether the Prisoner at the
Bar is not married to your Daughter-in-law?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chester.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Prisoner is married to my
Daughter-in-law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They ask this Question in hopes of its being of
Service to them in another Affair, for it cannot be of
any in this; though I hope he has got a very good
Wife.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>John Patterson</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Paterson</font> . I think you did attend the
Coroner's Inquest, upon this Occasion; please to give an
Account how <font>Egglestone</font> behaved then, and what he said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Paterson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, on the 4th of <font>May</font> , I attended
the Coroner's Jury at <font>Staines</font> ; though, as I had not Time
to enquire into the Fact, and prepare for Mr. <font>Annesley's</font>
Defence, I could do him but little more Service, than
by Cross examining the Witnesses for the Crown, and
making Observations on their Evidence; one of the
Witnesses was <font>John Egglestone</font> , who has been examined
here. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As to any Thing in his Behaviour you may
give Evidence, but not of any Thing that was reduced
into writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Paterson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can only speak as to what he said
before the Coroner, and I admit the Depositions taken
at that Time were reduced into writing by the
Coroner or his Clerk.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (The Reverend Mr. <font>Eusebius Williams</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, do you know <font>John Fisher</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any Talk with him about <font>Egglestone's</font>
being killed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Williams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Fisher</font> told me that <font>Egglestone</font> said   
he did
not believe the Gentleman kill'd his Father designedly;
but that it was an Accident.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (Mr. <font>Bethune</font> call'd.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, this is another Person
that is brought to contradict the Evidence of <font>Egglestone</font> ,
in what he said with respect to the Position of the Gun.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner's Council.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Egglestone</font> said the Gun was     
pointed
downward. Now we shall shew you from the Nature
<pagebreak id="432" />
of the Wound that it is morally impossible it should be
so, for the Wound is slanting upwards.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>James Bethune</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You are I think a Surgeon at <font>Brentford</font> :
did you see the Body of this <font>Egglestone</font> that was kill'd
at <font>Staines</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On <font>Sunday</font> after the Accident, my
Lord, I happened to be at <font>Laleham</font> , and Sir <font>Thomas
Reynel</font> gave me Leave to come in and hear the
Depositions: I was afterwards sent for by Mr. <font>Perkins</font> a
Surgeon at <font>Staines</font> , to attend the opening of the Body
before the Coroner; there were several of the Coroners
Jury in the Room. I found the Wound on the left
Side, about an Inch and an Half below the Ridge of
the Hip bone; the Wound I apprehend to be about
an Inch and an Half wide; I found it went into the
Cavity of the Belly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Wound go upward or downwards into
the Belly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I found it went into the Cavity of
the Belly, I remember'd in what Manner <font>Egglestone</font>
held the Gun when he was before Sir <font>Thomas Reynel</font> ,
to shew how Mr. <font>Annesley</font> held it when he fir'd: I
remember very well he held it to his Shoulder slanting
downward; I attempted to put my Probe into the
Wound in the same Direction as he described the Gun,
but there was no Passage for it in that Position, it would
not go in downwards; then I put it in this Manner cross
the Belly, and it went in without any Obstruction, and
then upwards, and it went in with the same Ease, in
this Manner. I observed several large Blisters, full
of black Serum on the Right Side, opposite the Place
where the Shot went in, the Blisters which were on
the opposite Side, were three or four Inches higher
than where the Wound was, -- the Wound was on the
left Side, and the Blisters on the Right; when I found
this was so plain to me, I desired it might be as plain
to the Jury and every one there, as it was to myself,
because this was a Matter of Fact and not of Judgment,
and I desired the Foreman to come and put the Probe
in and try, he did so and found the Wound as I have
described it: I was the more careful in this, because I
<pagebreak id="433" />
had observed the Evidence that the Boy gave on the
<font>Sunday</font> , and there was some Variation between that and
the Nature of the Wound, therefore I desired them to
take the more Notice of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you think those Blisters on the other
Side were occasioned by?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I apprehend they were occasioned by the
Force of the Powder.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> According to your Account, could
he, holding the Muzzle of the Gun upwards, have
made this Wound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It could not have made it with the Muzzle
downward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe how the Wound was upon the
Bone, and whether there were any Shot remaining in
the Wound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, but I found some Shot in the
Cavity of the Belly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now the Question is, whether the Shot,
coming upon this Bone, might not be thrown upwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, for the Shot went through the Bone,
so that the Gun must have been held obliquely,
pointing upwards; the Shot could not have gone through in
that Direction if the Muzzle of the Gun had 
pointed downwards; this is no Matter of Judgment, but I
have given you Demonstration of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say the Wound went from the left
Side to the Right, and that if the Muzzle of the Gun was
downwards, the Wound would be in the same Manner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly Sir, if the Muzzle of the Gun
is held downward, the Shot cannot go upward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foreman of the Jury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He makes it appear that the
Prisoner could not hold the Gun to his Shoulder, but that it
was held horizontally, and that it was impossible for him
to wound him in the Manner the Boy described, if the
Muzzle of the Gun had been pointed downward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bethune.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg leave to speak a few Words more to
your Lordship. While I was giving in this Evidence
before the Coroner and his Jury, if your Lordship
remembers, I said I had shewed them how the Wound
was, therefore I desired them to consider how consistent
it was with the Evidence that Mr. <font>Egglestone</font> had given:
<pagebreak id="434" />
I believe I proved it to the Coroner's Jury, and others
that were there, that it was impossible it could be done
in that Manner, if the Gun was held as he said, to his
Shoulder; upon that he comes up again, and, says he,
the Gentleman stooped when he did it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Council for the Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This shews how he departed
from what he had said, for he said first that Mr.
<font>Annesley</font> stood upright when he fired, and then that he
stooped in order to make his Evidence correspond with
the Wound.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>John Perkins</font> , Surgeon, sworn) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the Body of <font>Thomas Egglestone</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Perkins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I opened the Body on the 4th of <font>May</font> , and
on Inspection, I found one Wound of about an Inch and
an Half Diameter: I put in my Probe 7 or 8 Inches, by
which and likewise upon Inspection, I found it run
horizontal, a little upon the Ascending: I put my two
Fingers into the Cavity of the Bone, and shewed the
Jury how it was, and observ'd on the contrary Side,
4 or 5 Blisters, which I think to be occasioned by the
Force of the Powder from the other Side; but the Shot
did not go through the Skin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you whether these Blisters were higher
or lower than the Wound?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Perkins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Four or five Inches higher, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think these Blisters were 
occasioned by the Shot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Perkins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I apprehend they were.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (Mr. <font>King</font> , the Coroner called again.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was any Application made to you at any Time
to send Mr. <font>Annesley</font> a Prisoner to <font>Newgate</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I think it was Mr. <font>Giffard</font> , he came
along with another Gentleman, whose Name I think
is <font>Carrington</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, Captain <font>Carrington</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was: I said, I think the
Gentleman is secure enough: (there was a Lord
mentioned. but I cannot remember that he desired it:
Mr. <font>Giffard</font> wisely kept him from saying who it was) I
thought it was too severe to send him to <font>Newgate</font> , and
said that Sir <font>Thomas Reynel</font> was the Justice of Peace who
committed him, and he had taken sufficient Care about it.
<pagebreak id="435" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Paul Keating</font> sworn.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any Thing of <font>Egglestone</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keating.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did you come acquainted with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keating.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the <font>White Horse</font> in <font>Piccadilly</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Countryman are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keating.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came from <font>Ireland</font> , on Board a
Merchantman from <font>Waterford</font> : I was recommended to the Earl of
-- to say what I knew, as a Witness, about the Estate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you to the <font>White Horse</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keating.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was one <font>Lawler</font> that came over in the
same Ship. When I came to Town, I went and
enquired for him at the Earl of --'s, and he sent
me to the <font>White Horse</font> in <font>Piccadilly</font> to live, and there I
came acquainted with <font>Egglestone</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After your Acquaintance, do you remember any
Conversation with him, about what he was to have for
swearing in this Cause?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do, my Lord, remember mighty well; a little
Time after he came to the Inn, he and I got acquainted
together, and went out a walking to see the Town, and
particularly on a <font>Sunday</font> Morning; the <font>Sunday</font> after he
came to <font>Piccadilly</font> : I believe it was the second <font>Sunday</font> in
<font>May</font> ; as we were walking abroad, I asked him how he
came to live there, says he, I am here at the Expence
of the Earl of --.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is not proper: If you can call any Body
to contradict <font>Egglestone</font> you may, but this is reflecting
upon a noble Person's Character.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you how he came to be at that Inn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me that Mr. <font>Williams</font> , who keeps the
<font>White Horse</font> , brought him from <font>Staines</font> , and that he
should be very well provided for, if he would prosecute
this Gentleman, who is now in Custody, for this Murder,
and he desired I might contrive some Way that he might
get the Money secured, and I wrote two or three
Draughts of Notes for 200 <font>l.</font> and he took Copies of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came he to take Copies of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I did not care my Hand should be known.
I have a Copy of one of them in my Pocket. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Reads.) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I Promise to pay to Mr. <font>Thomas Egglestone</font> (that is his
elder Brother) or his Order, at or upon the 10th
<pagebreak id="436" />
Day of <font>June</font> next, the Sum of <font>200l.</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR 200 IN

Carpenter's Work, <font>&amp;c.</font>  Witness my Hand the 10th
Day of <font>May</font> 1742.
   This was to be signed either by <font>Williams</font> or my Lord --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you ever seen the Earl of -- at the <font>White     
Horse</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is there often.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What has the Earl of -- any Thing to do there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Coach and Horses are kept there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Q.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have they stood there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They stand there constantly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Serj. <font>Gapper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was that Note for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Keat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is only a Copy of what I wrote for             
<font>Egglestone</font> ,
for as I told the Court before, I did not care that my
Hand should be seen in any such Thing as Bribery and
Corruption.
