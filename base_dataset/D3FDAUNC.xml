<omission type="sentence" /> will you now leave this glorious

whereon your eternall honour may depend to
tye your selfe here at home to a Person so much
beneath you in birth and fortunes, a <font>Tanners</font>

very soule tels me she is all virtue, nor can I
think but my gifts and promises which I believe
have been greater then any others would tempt
her were her spotlesse virtue to be corrupted,
In sum sayes he, should the General himselfe
but tell me she were vicious, I would make him
feel the point of my sword, which I shall as
readily draw in defence of her honour, as of my
own life; therefore by the inviolable friendship
contracted between us let me beg you to desist,
from further mentioning her birth, or
<pagebreak id="1.1.38" />
blemishing her fame, for my eares are not capable of
hearing any other sound, then that she is faire
and virtuous; </dialogue><nonSpeech>to which I (seeing him so
resolute) replyed, that what I spake, was but the
advice of a true and cordial friend, who prized
his honour as my own, but since I found him so
absolutely determined in his love to <font>Besse
Bridges</font> , (for so was that faire Maid called) I would
not only desist to perswade him from it, but
assist him what I could in it, but withall advising
to make some farther tryal of her, and not point
blanck to marry her, for he might easily be
sensible how great a blemish it would be to his
honour, if she should afterwards be found tainted:
He was so rejoyced to heare these comfortable
words of mine, (for so he termed them) that
clapping his armes about my neck, and kissing
me,</nonSpeech><dialogue> oh now </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayes he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know thou art my friend
indeed, but how is it possible </dialogue><nonSpeech> (sayes he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that I
can make a tryall of her farther, the Fleet being
almost ready to depart, and no excuse can I in
honour make to stay here when they are gone,
you must venture that Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> it may be
before the departure of the Fleet somewhat
may happen, which may give you occasion both

comfort, who am reduced to this miserable
condition, for my inconsiderate rashnesse has not
only burdned me with the black stain and guilt
of murder, and hath laid me open to an
ignominious death, but that which above all grieves
me, forces me to lose the presence of a love
so faire, so sweet, so good, so chast, so virtuous
that the World cannot parallel her, oh <font>Goodlake</font>
tell me not then of comfort; Alas Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
'tis true you have laid your selfe open to all
these inconveniences, but yet the way shun them
or at least remedy them is not this, immoderate
griefe, if you stay here the law as you say will
very speedily pursue you, and what comfort
will it be for you to see me dye with you, could
I dye for you, I should let the World and you
<pagebreak id="1.1.40" />

would sacrifice my life for so good a friend,

why that is my greatest misery that I must be 
forced to do so, and leave my love behind me;
That may be but for a short time </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
remember that others (my selfe) have been made
subject to the same frownes of adverse fortune,
let those arguments of yours which were too
powerfull for me to gainsay the flying from my
deare <font>Mariana</font> , now prevaile with you,
besides </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you have now an occasion offered
to make tryall of your Loves fidelity, and
whether she be worthy those attributes which you
are pleased to give her. And art thou still
doubtfull of her virtue? </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said he, raising
himselfe from the Bed) </nonSpeech><dialogue> thou shall see me make such
tryall of her constancy, as shall make thee
declare her worthy not only of mine, but of the

fancies? how is it possible that we should

have or can have any power to obey any
command whatsoever, except it be to follow you in
death; but why should I talk of death since
there is yet hopes that you may live, and I live
happy in the enjoyment of your friendship;
flatter not your selfe </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> with any such
vain thoughts, for I find death to have even
already seazed me, but let me command you
live, that since I must die I may rest in peace;
since then </dialogue><nonSpeech> (repli'd I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you think my life
necessary to the quiet and rest of your soul, I shall
endeavour to live, if it be but so long as till I
fulfilled your injunctions, which be they what
they will, I here protest by those indissoluble
<pagebreak id="1.1.54" />
bonds of friendship which have been so often
confirmed betwixt us inviolably to perform;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>here I stopped, expecting what he would
enjoyn me, but he first desired me to take out of
his pocket a bundle of Papers wrapt up in a
scroule of parchment, in which sayes he you
will find my last Will and Testament; I

having found it out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what is your further
command concerning this </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Will </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said
he</nonSpeech><dialogue> I confirme my last, therein thou wilt find
that I have divided my whole estate between 
thee my dear friend, and my beloved <font>Bess
Bridges</font> , but with this proviso, that if thou
shalt find her in the least tainted, or to have
falsified the faith wherewith she made her self
mine, that five hundred pound <font>per annum</font>
which I had resolved to estate her in, let me
beg of thee likewise to accept, and in requital
of it to obey these easie commands; First, That
thou wilt restore this Ring to my beloved <font>Besse</font> ,
the last pledge she gave me of her faith, which
if she have kept intire, will rejoyce her heart,
and ease it somewhat of griefe for my death, if
not, 'twill be a strong witnesse against her to
condemn her as the most light, inconstant, and
very woman, in the world; secondly, That if
thou shalt find that she hath either broke her
faith, or forfeited her honour, thou wilt not
fail to take from her my picture, which how
unworthy soever, is too good to be enjoyed
or breathed on by one unchast; and thirdly,
that thou wouldest make what hast possible
<pagebreak id="1.1.55" />
thou canst to the ship, least thou lose the
opportunity of this passage, and leave me to my
fate, farewell; Farewell? </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> O ye
Heavens! and is <font>Spencer</font> then so unkind as to
command me from him? this command doth more
afflict me then when he bid me live; for
without his presence I am but dead in my own
conceit, but to be forced from him when he is
even ready to render his soul to heaven, is worse
then death! either </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> command me not
from you, or command me not to live: If
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Spencer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the peace of my mind were not
concerned in your absence, I should be as
unwilling to be deprived of you, as you seem
willing to die for my sake; but since neither
my dying desires, nor our former ties of
friendship can work upon you to leave me, I
must rest content, and as well as I can, pacifie
my spirits: Nay, now </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you are unjust,
if my earnest love made me speak somewhat
disgustfull, what reason have you to blame me?
I will go, but who shall then close up your
dying eyes? who shall see you interred? what
friend shall weep a tear upon your funerall
hearse? must it be added to the rest of my
torments, that I cannot perform the last duty of
a friend to you? for that </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> trouble not
your selfe, and ad not your afflictions to the
heap of my miseries, you are not the first that
has lost a friend, but the first </dialogue><nonSpeech> (repli'd I) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that

such was the rage of the Gentleman, who

though at present he expressed not his disgust,
yet he awaited his revenge, which my forced

occasions, gave him better opportunity of
effecting, for having traced careless <font>Schiarra</font> into a
private walk, he very rudely conjures him to
draw; <font>Schiarra</font> was so amazed that he could
not a first finde any answer, but that he
believed the Gentleman was mistaken: But the other
with a kinde of Spanish <font>Bravado</font> , answers, that
he should finde his eyes had found out their true
object, and that if he refused to draw, he
would send his coward soul to hell.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied

garb should be at least a Gentleman, but you
must give me leave to admire your judgement,

am confident never injured you, nor to my
knowledge ever saw you before, but let me
but know the reasons induce you to it, and
you shall quickly finde I am no coward; </dialogue><nonSpeech>all the
reason in the world could produce no other
answer from the furious Gentleman, then that he
had offered him am affront, which he was

resolved to revenge, and therefore advised him to
draw, otherwise his sword should force him;</nonSpeech><dialogue>

reverence on thy knees, one whose heavenly
looks would tempt a Hermit, who had spent his

Angels would desert their bliss, and count it a
greater happiness then Heaven to enjoy her;

sword should reach thee. </dialogue><nonSpeech>These words gave me

<omission type="line" /> Do but name him, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said I,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and
assure your self he is seal'd for dead. 'Tis, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Petruchio</font> , eldest son and heir to the <font>Count de
Ligue</font> ; in the mean time do you and your 
friend come to morrow night with some
Musick to her chamber window, and doubt not of
gentle audience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>I returned to my friend with joy, to have
effected thus much, who embracing me, and
calling me the Author of his happiness, told me,
that he had likewise discovered somewhat which
would not displease me.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What is it, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said I,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Prythee? why, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> no sooner was I come
home, but <font>Catharina</font> your sister <font>Isabellas</font>
servant calling me aside, began to tell me very
seriously, that she was sorry she must be
messenger of such ill news, desiring me to arm my self
with a noble patience, and not let passion grow
predommant at the hearing it. I began to muse
what it should be, and feared nothing more then
that thy sister <font>Isabella</font> having discovered my
falshood, had chalked out some path for
revenge; but those fears were soon dissipated, by
the maids telling me, almost with tears in her
eyes, that <font>Isabella</font> had forgot all he loves to
me, and now doted on the <font>Lorenso</font> son to the
Marquis of <font>Sannazzaro</font> , whom she had onely
espied out of a window carrying in a chair to be
dressed of a wound he then seemed to have
newly received. I easily </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Schiarra</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> guessed
<pagebreak id="1.2.36" />
it to be the person whose life my <font>Florelia</font> had
begged, and so was I rejoyced at the news that
I could hardly feign to her to be troubled, which
I thought fit to do. You did well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said I,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to do
so, but you must now think of going to
entertain your Mistris, <omission type="sentence" />

<pagebreak id="1.2.37" />
<omission type="line" /> It is one,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>answered <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> whom you (when for your sake he
saved your brothers life) promised so much to
honor as to keep in memory. If you be he,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>answered <font>Florelia</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess I am obliged to honor
your Nobleness, but you must excuse me if at
these untimely hours I dare admit no
conference, your Musick Sir, I thank you for, and so
much do I love you that I would not endanger
you, for if you should be seen here, your life
would run a hazard, therefore farewel: </dialogue><nonSpeech>here
she was about to shut the window, when
<font>Schiarra</font> with a passionate voice cried out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for Loves
sake, stay <font>Madam</font> , for were there here dangers
as thick as there are Stars above us, nay were
<pagebreak id="1.2.38" />
even death it self, here I would scorn his fury,
and believe that whilest you stay, I am by your
presence made immortal. I am content,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> lest you should condemn me of
discourtesie to stay, but you must then be brief
in telling me what you desire. Oh! Madam,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> confine me not to such hard
terms, and yet why should I crave greater
license since all I wist for is summed in these few
words, Madam, I love you, and desire your
love. And is that all, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> then Sir farewel,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and herewith she made a second proffer to shut
the window, and had done it, had not <font>Schiarra</font>
withheld her by crying;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Madam! let me
conjure by the blood, which yet for your sake
flows in your brother veins, to stay and hear me
further. That charmes me for some time,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> but consider, I pray, both your
danger and mine, and therefore conclude with
speed. Know then Lady, </dialogue><nonSpeech>continued <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
that my zeal could tell you, that you are above
expression fair, that your eyes illuminate the
night, and Eclipse the Stars in their greatest
brightness, that you are the Master-piece of
Nature, in which she strove to wed Art and
Beauty together, but these terms though they 
want nothing of truth, yet are onely fit to be
used by those whose loves lie in their lips, my
deeds shall speak the truth and constancy of my
love. Should all the actions in the world
confirm your love, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered <font>Florelia</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I must still
return you the same answer that I dare not,
cannot love you, for my more honest thoughts
<pagebreak id="1.2.39" />
permit me not to deride your passions with
frustrate species, or flatter them with vain hopes,
but as you have been brief in your desires, I
will be the same in my denial; in confidence
of the truth of which, I desire you to rest
satisfied, and assure your self, that whilest you persist
farther in it, you do but plough the seas, and
write in the sand. You are noble, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered
<font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> thus to rid me of my torment, and
not permit me languishing to burn in those hot
tortures, behold this blade, which once for your
sake did refrain from shedding your dear
brothers blood, shall now make me a victime to
your cruelty, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and here-withall he was about to
have sheathed his sword in his bosom, and had
doen it, had not I who stood hard by perceiving
his intent, ran to him and stayed his arm, which
<font>Florelia</font> perceiving,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what a
fainthearted soldier are you thus to despair at the
first repulse, grant that I could affect you, would
you not account me light should I at the first
assault be won, before I had made any
experience of your faith and loyalty; nor can I
without my fathers consent adventure to love any,
get that, and you may perchance finde 
heartroom in my breast. Me thinks those words,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> return me to a new life, me
thinks the enamoured Stars hangs o're thy lips,
expecting a blessing from them. Be not too hasty
Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Florelia</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for it is yet impossible I should
love you, being already contracted. And yet 'tis
in your power, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to love your servant.
Well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I can hold out no longer, and if
<pagebreak id="1.2.40" />
what Anatomists write, that in the Center of our
hearts, there is a little concave where resides
our best affections, be true, then is your Augury
a divine truth, for all the love lies therein
engaged to the worth of another, not to the
jealousie of him to whom my father hath
contracted me. May I be so happy Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as to receive from your sweet lips the name
of the person whom you are pleased to make so
blessed? Know then Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for I can no
longer conceal it, but let the night yet shroud
me with a blacker cloud, to hide from you the
blushes of my face, that from the first time I
saw you, and observed the nobleness of your
temper, in saving my brothers life, which he
had rashly forfeited to your just revenge, I
become a true devotarist to those vertues which to
me seem'd heavenly: </dialogue><nonSpeech>Here she made a small
stop, expecting that <font>Schiarra</font> should return some
answer, but into such an extasie had his joy
transported him, that he was not so sensible of his
happiness as to return a due thanks for it, when
his silence gave <font>Florelia</font> occasion to continue
thus;</nonSpeech><dialogue> I fear Sir, my to soon yielding to your
desires has abated, or utterly extinguished that
love you but now zealously protested to bear
me, but if it have, I can but blame my own
credulity; </dialogue><nonSpeech>farther she would have proceeded, when
<font>Schiarra</font> recollecting himself, interrupted her by
crying out;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! Madam, do not believe my
silence to proceed from any other cause then
the exuberance of my joy, your words have
ravisht me beyond my hopes, and made my
<pagebreak id="1.2.41" />
heart too narrow to contain that bliss, which now
you have made it entertainer of. Then Sir,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> excuse my jealous mistake, and if
you please walk round about the house, my maid
shall attend to give you entrance. I will flie to
such happiness Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="sentence" />

<omission type="sentence" /> what art thou, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said I,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
that after thou hast made a forfeit of thy life by
over-hearing our secrets, darest thus rashly
tempt thy death, be gone, be gone, and bless
that fate that spare thee. Be gone, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> were
you encompassed with whole Legions, this single
sword would dare to encounter them, and force
a way to my revenge. Your very valiant,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied I,</nonSpeech><dialogue> or else some strange and unknown
desperate frenzy has seiz'd you, retire Sir, or tell
what 'tis hath prompted you to this madness.
You shall finde 'tis not madness but justice,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> which of you two is it that dares attempt
to court my <font>Florelia</font> , mine I call her, since
both her self and father have confirm'd her so.
Dare Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'tis I dare do it, and
will, what darest thou do to oppose it? I dare
<pagebreak id="1.2.42" />
Sir revenge it, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> but first I'le tell that
wrong you do both heaven and me, in striving
to deprive me of my betrothed Spouse, she is
mine, nor can she while I live be any others.
This sword shall clear my passage to her,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and since you must have a
Mistris, I'le send you to choose one amongst the
Infernal deities. Dear friend, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he, turning
to me,</nonSpeech><dialogue> put up your sword, this glorious quarrel
doth concern none but my self; come Sir draw,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (again to <font>Petruchio</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and let our weapons decide
whose she must be. Stay Sir a little, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Petruchio</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you seem a person well qualified, and
let me with your badness of your cause chill that
blood which flows so violently in your veins,
consider that with your blood you strive to
ravish her from me, who both by her self and
father hath been confirmed mine, before whole
quires of Saints and blessed Angels; let not
your lust then blinde you to run head-long to a
sin so horrid and abominable. Oh! Sir, consider,
and hazard not your souls salvation on a quarrel
so unjust, should it be my fate, as in justice it
must be, to kill thee, consider what a masse of
endless woe (hast thou no other sins to charge
thy conscience with) thou pluckst upon thy head,
sure this must cause an earthquake in thy blood.
I am no School-boy, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Schiarra</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to be thus
Catechized, words are to weak to force me
from the love of the Beautous <font>Florelia</font> , if you
will enjoy her you must fight for her, which
with what reason you can do, when you know
that after your sword has gained her from me,
<pagebreak id="1.2.43" />
you must likewise force that will which cannot
love you; come Sir prepare your self, or resolve
Lamb-like to die her sacrifice. Since you are so
resolute, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Petruchio</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> this sword shall
quickly finde your heart, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and therewith
drawing made a sudden thrust at <font>Schiarra</font> , who as
nimbly avoided it, and with the point of his
weapon found a smooth way to his enemies
heart, who without speaking a word fell down
and died, and <font>Schiarra</font> glad that it was done
with so little noise, and I proceeded to finde
our entrance into the house, at the back door of
which we found <font>Florelias</font> maid attending, who
joyfully received <font>Schiarra</font> , and both desired me
to walk to my Palace, the maid assuring me that
my friend need fear no danger;</nonSpeech> <omission type="sentence" />

so noble corps! Oh! that I were so happy to
lye by thee, but since that cannot be, I'le study
how to dye, that though our bodies lie at this
vast distance, our souls may meet and safely
harbor together! and yet, why should I be so cruel
to my self, to whom thou vvast so unkinde as
not to leave me some few commands before thy

that Heaven might repay it <font>Spencer</font> , but with it

accompany my corps to the grave. </dialogue><nonSpeech>I was so extreamly

highly graced in the Court of the mighty King
of <font>Fesse</font> and <font>Morocco</font> ; My Master, which makes
me the more admire, that in requital of his
favours you should thus slaughter his beloved
Subjects, by which you have made a double
forfeit of your life; for the outrage committed
against his Guard at the dead of night, is death
in it self; but those you have slain in the

   <nonSpeech>The Guard readily obeyed the command of

though I am a Moor, a Nation strange to you
<pagebreak id="2.1.122" />
Christians; yet, think that I can be noble; but
in you I have observed such strange
contrarieties, that I cannot tell well how to reconcile
them; for when I consider your mighty actions
and late greatness of your Spirit, when my men
flew before you like dust before the wind, I
cannot but admire at your present passion, and
justly wonder why such a small effuse of blood,
let out by these sleight wounds, or the pale-fear
of grisly death should draw a tear for such a
Noble eye; Thou most worthy of thy Nation
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (replyed <font>Spencer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> do not so much mistake me,
to think that wounds, blood, death, or all tortures
imaginable, could force one drop from hence;
but that I now suffer under, as far exceeds all
torments that ever the wicked art, or wit of
Man invented, as Hell doth Heaven in pains.
This it is, that like the burning Sun extracts
from my declining Soul, this dewy and
effeminate moisture: Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (answered the <font>Bassa</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if I
have yet gained in you an opinion, that I dare
be noble, impart to me your sorrow's, and if
any thing in my power can assist you, though it
be with the hazard of my life, rest assured I will
perform it. Your Nobleness most Illustrious
<font>Bassa</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (answered <font>Spencer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> obliges me to relate
my misfortune, though I must despair of
remedy; yet if you have a heart not wholly
composed of Adamant, it must needs melt it, to
consider my misery; and think then Sir, if you
have ever loved, or if ever you loved one so fair,
so constant, so chast, as my dear Spouse;
whether it would not confound you, and make
<pagebreak id="2.1.123" />
whole Oceans of tears flow from your eyes, to
know that for your sake she was betrayed to a
black and remediless-fate? I confess 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (answered the <font>Bassa</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> 't would perplex a well-biassed
Soul; but how can this be your condition? were
nor all your joy's but lately consummate, by
uniting your Souls, according to your own
manner of marriage, and were you not but
yesterday both honoured in the highest degree,
by the vertuous <font>Mullisheg</font> ? 'Tis  true, worthy
<font>Bassa</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (replyed <font>Spencer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> he honoured us at first
too much, but at length his lust outway'd his
honour, and as if his Soul had been of a darker

that he had given me, and rob me of that
Jewel I prize far above my Life; but the fates
were yet happy unto me, in that I found means 
this night to convey my beauteous Spouse, the
Captain, and Lieutenant, and others aboard

but missing my way fell amongst your Guard,
where wonder not that I performed wonders,
and durst single oppose my self against your

left upon my heart, made me act things
beyond a man. But Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (replyed <font>Ioffer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> since
she is safe aboard, recal your noble spirits, and
let not your own fates thus distract you. Ah!
generous Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Spencer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the sting of all is
yet behind, I at her parting from me, swore by
the honour of a Gentleman, and by all the
vow's and loves had ever past between us, that
if I survived, I would visit her aboard before 
<pagebreak id="2.1.124" />
the morning Star appeared, which she seconded
with a solemn vow, that if I did not she should
certainly esteem me dead, and not Heaven it
self should hinder her from following me to the
Grave, This Great <font>Bassa</font> is it; Fear of her
safety not my own, that drew these tears from a
Souldiers eyes. </dialogue><nonSpeech>'Twas strange what noble pitty
this relation bred in the heart of the thrice

answer to return, nor indeed how to accept his

he resolved not to refuse the Courtesy, but

some solemn Oath, to return at an appointed
hour:</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (replyed <font>Ioffer</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> it will be sufficient,
if you give me your word to return by that
time to morrow, that the Sun shall be mounted
to the Meridian: Let God's and Men
