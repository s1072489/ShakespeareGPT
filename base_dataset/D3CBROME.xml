</dialogue> <head>ACT II. SCENE I.</head>  

<nonSpeech> <font>Alicia, Lady, Servingman, Prentice.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All Cheape-side, and Lombard-streete Madam,
could not have furnish'd you with a more
compleat bargaine, you will find it in the wearing, and thanke
me both for the goodnesse of the stuffe, and of the
Manufacture.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But now the price Mistris <font>Saleware</font> . I grant your
Commodity is good, The Gold and Silver Laces, and 
the Frienges are rich, and I hope well wrought. Has your
Man made a note of the particulars, and their prices, at
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
the rate of ready-money (for I buy so) and not as you
would booke 'em to an under-ag'd heire, or a 
Court-Cavalier to expect payment two or three yeares hence;
and finde it perhaps never. I come with <font>Here is one for
tother</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know your Ladiships payment such; And they are
priz'd so Madam to a farthing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let mee see, broad plate Silver and Gold-lace,
206 Ounces halfe, and a dram, at five and ten pence the
Ounce. 60 l. 5 s. 3 d. <font>ob.</font> 4. five and ten pence an Ounce 
is deare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I protest unto you Madam that parcell of Lace for
a Bed as you intend it, was bespoken, and agreed for at
six shillings the Ounce by a very great person: but 
because ready money came not to fetch it off, Fortune
reserv'd it here for you, you could not have been so fitted
on the sodaine else within <font>London</font> walls; and I am glad
the same fortune was so favourable to me, as by my hands
to designe it for your Ladiships use and pleasure. I hope
Madam we shal hear of a young heir a comming shortly,
and that will make it a rich and fortunate Bed indeed;
And then Sir <font>Olyver</font> would thanke me too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a bold slut it is, well then the rest of the
particulars here of Laces <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Laees</comment> , and Frienges,     
Loopes, and
Buttons, makes the sum of all an hundred pound eight
shillings foure pence, halfe-penny. I am no good
Arithmetician, but if any be overcast, and overpaid, you must
allow restitution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, good Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is all put up into this Box?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give mee my Purse. Take you home that while I
make payment for it; your Gold-weights Mistris
<font>Saleware</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Servant.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here Madam all in readinesse.
<pagebreak id="C3R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You take no Gold but what is weight I presume.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis but light paines to weigh it Madam. But let me
save your Ladiship that labour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor shall it be your trouble, command your
Servant I pray for a glasse of your beere --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some beere for my Lady presently. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.        
Prentice.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I may tell you in more privacy, what
perhaps you would not have him heare: for Prentises though
they are bound to keepe their Masters secrets, are not
all privy to their Mistresses; that's more a Journeymans
Office.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Ladiship is pleas'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not very well with my selfe, for I have gone
beyond my Commission in this bargaine, and exceeded my
Husbands allowance. Here's one hundred pounds eight
shillings 4 d. <font>ob.</font> in the Bill, and he allowes me but the bare
hundred pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The od money is but a small matter Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A great matter in an honest poore Countrey
Ladies purse, may serve her a whole Christmas at Post and
Pare, or Farthing gleeke, when the gay Gamsters wives
o' the City may command the hundreds, out of the
purses of such poore Ladies Husbands. But here is the odd
money, eight shillings foure pence, half penny, and so all's
paid. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What meanes your Ladiship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe you not understand mee then? I'le tell you
that which I thought fit to conceale from your servant;
And from your husband too had hee been here, perhaps
he knowes not on't. My husband left with you, or lent
you the last Terme a hundred pound, which hee assign'd
to me; and now I have it in Commodity. Had you
forgot it, when it was to do you a good turne, when your
absent husband faild you, and you wanted it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A good turne Madam?
<pagebreak id="C3V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, was it not to have the free use of a hundred 
pound ready money, a whole quarter of a yeare, through
a dead Vacation, and at last to take it out in wares? A
good turne I thinke for a Trades-woman; take heed you
do not by your sullennesse make me suspect another kind
of good turne, or that you did my husband any to my
injury, nor deny the receipt of his money, lest I take up
a violence that will not become mee, nor you be able to
beare. Be therefore well advis'd both in what you say,
and who heares me. Somebody comes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Prentice with Beere.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam your Beere.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le pledge you Mistris <font>Saleware</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall presume then Madam -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Drinks.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was right cast, was it not friend?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Ladyship will finde it so -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.         
Drinks.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I hope you will finde your money so well
bestowd Madam, that you will vouchsafe always to know
the Shop.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ever upon the like occasion, Mistris <font>Saleware</font> , 
so
most kindly farwell sweet Mistris <font>Saleware</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The humblest of your servants Madam. Open the
Boot for my Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis done, my Coach-man does it. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would the Devill were in your Coachmans Coat
to take his carriage for his paines. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady returnes.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One word more Mistris <font>Saleware</font> , can it be he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lay your comands on me good Madam. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtsie.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not to your trouble, I perceive a young
Gentleman attends for conference with you. Is not his name
<font>Fitzgerrard</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Madam, his name is <font>Bellamie</font> , much
depending on the young Lord <font>Lovely</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought I had known him, hee is a handsome
youth. I cannot blame you now with him: but beware 
<pagebreak id="C4R" />
of old Knights that have young Ladies of their owne.
Once more adieu sweet Mistris <font>Saleware</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most courteous Madam -- and once more to the
Devill. But on my life her chast Ladiship is taken with
this beard-lesse <font>Bellamie</font> . How shee shot eyes at
him!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now may your servant obtaine a hearing
Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My eares are open Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you are sad or angry, why seemes that brow
to threaten a subjection over him that is your vanquish'd
captive; or has <font>Cupid</font> plac'd his Bow there bent at me,
whose heart already lodges all his Arrowes, never to be
restor'd but by your pity?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, fie upon't! what talke is this? I am vex'd, and
you would mad me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What has displeas'd you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A crosse businesse that has happened in my Shop
to day, I being none of the wisest Chapwoman, have
undersold a parcell of the best Commodities my husband
had. And should hee know't wee should have such a
scwable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Husbands should be so serv'd that do impose
Those mercenary Offices on their wives.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Talke so, and I will heare you, your amorous notes
sound like Play-speeches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Servile, nay slavish Offices, ranking their wives
with their prentises.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They pretend onely that wee should over-looke
our servants, when they but set us there for shew to draw
in custome: but in making us such over-seers they are
overseene themselves; Shopkeepers-wives will be
medling and dealing in their kinde, and as they are able, as wel
as their husbands (some much better, and more
profitable) but I was overreach'd I confesse.
<pagebreak id="C4V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For no great matter I hope.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, the matter was not much (that never fretted 
me) but the manner has eene kild a Shee shop-keeper.
I cannot be long-liv'd, here under a Pent-house, as my
Lord (you know) told mee when he said he would shut
mee out of this servitude, and that I should change my
Coat, though my husband could not, before hee were an
Alderman, and be rank'd with Ladies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord has still the same regard of you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it appeares by the Tailor and the Mercer, whom
he sent foure dayes since to measure me out, and sute mee
to his Honour, and no returne of them found, yet his
Land might ha' beene measur'd all and sold, while a
poore sute is dreampt on, had he borne the mind of some
Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I doubt not but this paper will cleare that
jealousie. And while you reade I'le speake that which I
dare not utter through, Sighes and Blushes to an intire
attention.
I am of Noble-blood my selfe, free-borne,
And not without good education;
But since I am ingag'd in this imployment,
And made an instrument of others lust,
I finde my selfe a scandall to my Name,
To Honour, and to Vertue, the base blot
Of Pandare sticking on me. But not this
Alone is my affliction. Here's my torment,
That while I doe true service to my Lord
(Whom I must ever honour) in my Agency
Unto your selfe (whom I cannot but love)
I finde my selfe a Traytor to his trust,
In my negotiation for my selfe.
Nor can I finde it possible to desist,
Mine own attempts, to you, or forbeare to urge
Your constancy to him.
<pagebreak id="C5R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How easie a worke
'Twere for one woman to supply 'em both,
And hold her husband play to levell Acoile,
A wooden two-leav'd booke, a paire of Tables
Would do't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How wretched is that suppliant, who must make
Sute to obtaine that, which he feares to take!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the beare at the Bridge-foot six a clock, good.
Sir, I finde my Lords honorable appointments here, and
have heard you all this while.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I could wish, and was in hope you had
not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not blame you on your Lords behalfe;
Because you have enough rebuk'd your selfe.
But Sir, if you presume upon the favour
I give your Lord, and therefore to obtaine me,
Cause I am his, you undervalue me
To thinke that I can stoop unto his servant,
Though almost his Companion, you may thinke
After that degradation by degrees,
I may, in time, descend unto his Footman, I'me no cast
Garment of his Lordships yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have school'd mee fairely, I am humbled,
Lady -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dee heare, dee heare sir, Mr. <font>Bellamine</font> , 
One word before you goe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pren.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What would hee buy Mistris? can you take his
money?
Sir dee heare?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray attend you the tother end o' th' Shop,
If I cannot handle a Customer, why dos your Master
trust mee? Could a frowne fright you? Let a smile then
cheare you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And that's a heavenly one,
As that of <font>Cynthia</font> at <font>Endymion</font> .
<pagebreak id="C5V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray leave your Player-like passionate expressions.
And if you love mee, like a Man speake to me.
As I am a Woman; are you silent? if you doubt the 
length of my mans Eares at that distance, you may
whisper what so? But that is a right shop-whisper indeed
with Trades-women that are handsome; Is that the
most you will give sir? Could I afford it so, doe you
thinke I'd make two words w'ye? yet this before you
goe -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kisse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now match it for the price I'le give it 
you for nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall forget I have a Lord. I must forget him
here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe so, and if (I say) you love mee, speake
plainely what you would have mee doe, or what you
would doe with mee (I love to dant these young things
that love before they can love to the purpose, or speake
to't handsomely like a Boy that would faine be
shooting at wild-fowle, before hee knowes how to discharge
a Birding-piece) I would heare you speake, you have
often muttered and fribled some intentions towards me,
but I would heare you speake. Come, if you love me lay
by the feare of the Lord that sent you, and tell me
roundly now, what you would have me doe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would intreat you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well; what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you would be pleas'd --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With what? or to doe what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To weare this paire of Silke stockins for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that all your sute, 'tis granted, with my thanks
to you; Have you no more to say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I say you are the beautifull'st of Women;
and that my Lord in your enjoyment is the
happiest --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay thinke not of your Lord, but aske me, 
something.
<pagebreak id="C6R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would but dare not hope for such a favour,
you'l never grant it, my unworthinesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can you tell?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will not wrong my Lord, so as to doe it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in his sight perhaps. What is it? come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is then, let it be so. Go to Schoole child.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is -- That you would, let me -- give you this   
ring,
And grace it with your Finger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will that be a wrong to your Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, to weare any favours, but his own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dos he know this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nor I would not that he should (and given by
me) for all the Rubies in Cheapside, where I bought this
but now, over the way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come sir, I'le dally w'ye no longer, I know what
you would have with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And now you will betray me: I am sham'd then
and undone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, but I have you o' the hip. 'Tis plaine you
would lie with me: deny it if you can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O deare, did I say so now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What need you when I know it, you would lie
with me, and you shall. Take courage man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, in good earnest, shall I? shall I?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, in good earnest, you'l finde it no trifling
businesse, when you come to't once. But sir, upon
condition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Any condition Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All purpose on't is lost, and all comes out else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name your condition, I'le performe it if it be in 
the power of my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You saw here at your comming a faire Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tooke no notice of her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But she did of you, she is calld the Lady            
<font>Thrivewell</font> .
<pagebreak id="C6V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Oliver Thrivewells</font> Lady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same, you have known her it seemes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seene her before shee was married.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will be briefe with you, as you love mee shee
loves you as eagerly, but with much more boldnesse, you
saw her whisper mee, and how loth shee was to depart,
when her eye was upon you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did observe it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shee is my noble friend, and the sweetest Lady,
I need not set her out. But though you thinke you suffer
in your honour, in being an instrument twixt your Lord
and mee, with the base blot of Pander sticking on you,
(these were your words) I have ingag'd my selfe for
her to be your Pandaresse; be so, I shall be even with you
in businesse if you account it so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What dee meane Lady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To urge against my selfe, for that sweete Lady,
which no Woman else I thinke would doe, that loves
you so unfainedly as I. But 'tis my fate, and the
injunction I must lay upon you, to make mee yours. That first
you give your selfe to her Embraces; I'le give you means
for your accesse to her, and your successe with her,
which done, and on your faith affirm'd to mee, 'tis so,
I will perpetually bee yours more freely then your
Lords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You urge this but to try my constancy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For that I'le satisfie you soon, my husband coming
we must to night at the Beare --
My Lord writes so.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Saleware.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And there I will direct you in your progresse.
<font>Ally</font> how dost? Mr. <font>Bellamy</font> how ist? How dos my
noble Lord? You are sad methinks. Ha' you overbought
any thing here, and so repent your bargaine? Or cannot
my wife, and you agree upon't? you must use Mr. <font>Bellamy</font>
<pagebreak id="C7R" />
kindly my sweet <font>Ally</font> : hee is our noblest Lords most
speciall favorite, and must finde all faire dealing here, as
well when I am abroad as at home sweet heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You heare not mee complaine sir, fare you
well. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What an Affinego's this! He might ha' thank'd
mee for my good words, though I meant him no good
will, I hope thou hast overreach'd him indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Thomas</font> your hopes are vaine, <font>Thomas</font> in      
seating
mee here to overreach, or underreach any body. I am 
weary of this Mechanick course <font>Thomas</font> ; and of this
courser habit, as I have told you divers and sundry times
<font>Thomas</font> , and indeed of you <font>Thomas</font> that confine me to't,
but the bound must obey.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never the sooner for a hasty word, I hope sweete
<font>Ally</font> ; Not of me nor of my shop I prethee at seasonable
times Love. But for thy habit (though this be decent on
a Citizens wife) use thine owne fancy, let it be as
Courtly, or as Lady-like as thou pleasest, or my Lords
desires.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Al.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I am friends agen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Troth, and I'le call thee friend, and I prethee, let
that be our familiar and common compellation: friend
it will sound daintily, especially when thou shalt appeare
too gallant to be my Wife.

wherefore since you have so nobly undertaken the conveyance

you; That at your visit of her you may say, <font> <foreign>veni, vidi,

she is your own.

Doctor that preaches boyld in't I thinke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a composition of mine owne Sir, of many
excellent decoctions, of most wholesome restorative, and
costly ingredients.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That it was sent by her makes it more
excellent, whose bounteous care of me, I must acknowledge
exceeds all cost in carving to me, and countenancing me
at her Table, in gracing me in presence of the Ladies
that come to visit her; in giving charge for decency in
all things for my Chamber, my fires shining, my odours
burning, my livery serv'd in, my soft and costly bed
prepar'd and spread with perfum'd linnen -- here's
Ambergreece in this now --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O is it so, doe you finde that?

e'ne say 'tis pity a young man had her not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a wag's this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shee is a most sweet Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shee is a sweete Lady indeed, I can best speake
<pagebreak id="D2V" />
it that have knowne her from the wombe hitherto: A
sweete infant shee was borne, and a sweete babe I
swadled it, and a sweete child I nurs'd it, I traynd it up a
sweete child. It was in manners a sweet child, at her
Booke and Sample a sweet child. I never whipt it but 
once, and then it was sweete too, and sprawl'd but a
little, and whimper'd but a little it was so sweet a child;
And so shee grew upwards, and upwards towards
woman, and a sweet youngling shee was, and so grew 
upwards and upwards towards man, and then a sweete
Bride shee was, and now a most sweet Lady shee is,
(as you say, and I commend you for it) And so she stands
at a stay. For now shee growes no more upwards then
upon her Wedding day, not upwards as I would have
her upwards, here I meane young Gentlemen, could I
but see a sweet babe of hers once by my Master, I could
be then content to sleep with my Ancestors.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had rather see your Gibship hang'd up with
Polcatts in a Warren, and your sweet Lady with you,
though I confesse that were some pitty. I hope her
barrennesse, or his will preserve her from my curse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope still, and shee hopes still; and I make
him of this broth for every morning, and many other
good strengthning things (I cannot say for the same
purpose) for I shall never see him have an heire by
her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Excellent! that's best of all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because you then are heire, say you so? Is that
your love to your Aunt?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No I protest <font>Nurse</font> , I meant by the broth, the 
bottome was the best of all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I cry mercy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cannot all thy art, and her cost finde helpe for
my Unkle, think'st thou, to get a child?

<pagebreak id="D3R" />
and helpes enough, were she not too vertuous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Still thou mistak'st me <font>Nurse</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Away wag away, your Aunt loves you too well
to thinke so of her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nurse</font> as I hope to inherit any thing 
hereafter --

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nurse</font> , by this good -- peece I thinke no
harme.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, nay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take it I say. And tell her if thou wilt, that I
love her so well, that were shee not mine Unkles
wife, I would get her an heire my selfe rather then be
his. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Kinde young Master, now I am heartily sorry
that I mov'd you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And for my Unkle were I his heire apparent, I
rather wish he might live till all this World were weary
of him, and the next affraid to take him.
Then I survive him (Tongue <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Tonuge</comment> , a pox punish

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thirdly, and lastly, let mee advise you, since
you are so hot upon Marriage, though I assure my
selfe you love none but mee, (and I thanke you for't)
that you fraine or dissemble an affection to some one of 
the City, who is but comparative to your selfe in blood
and fortune, and so you may make by-use of me as your
friend, and have children like me,
<font>George Carelesse</font> .
<pagebreak id="D5R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cros.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you ever heard so queint a Love Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lady, the injury done in it, to your selfe is
unanswerable, but my wrong in being his Messenger, I will
make him answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cros.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Excuse me Sir, he has done me a favour; I pray
informe him so with my great thankes. But for what
you conceive a wrong to your selfe, use your discretion,
you have no more to say to me for him at this present,
have you sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not for him but against him, I will un-say all that
I sayd before intended for his good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cros.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But i'le not heare you wrong your former love,
and judgement of him so, which made so deepe
impression here, that I had lock'd his love up as a Jewell in
my Breast, and you in striving now to wrest it thence
may breake the Cabinet; I rather wish you'l be a 
friendly meanes to draw his presence hither, that I my self may
mildly question him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you serious Lady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cros.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I feare I shall not rest before I see him, but doe
not tell him that, lest in this sullen humour, hee force his
absence to afflict mee more; I'le hold you sir no
longer, deale for me as you can, I know you have a guesse at 
my desire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le doe you service in it. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Crostill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I guesse that her desire is to doe some act of Revenge
upon him. And (so it be not mortall) it were but
Justice in her for so grosse a scorne by him cast upon a well
reputed Gentleman. Yet is it observ'd in her that shee
has a violent humour to do, and not to doe things
oftentimes wilfully against all good councell or perswasion,
shee has the spirit of contradiction in her, and an
unalterable resolution upon sodaine intentions, a most
incorrigible will shee has that will not bow nor breake. This
crosse abusive Letter therefore may doe good upon her,
<pagebreak id="D5V" />
however mischievous hee might intend it. If shee meant
well to him before, it may the faster bring her on, but it
amazes me that hee should write so, bearing his Unkle,
and my selfe in hand, that hee so fairely lov'd her, and
besought us to negotiate with her for him, should shee
forgive it, yet the wrong to us in his vile manners is
unpardonable, and so sir, I come to you.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have employed mee basely, made mee your
Carrier of scandall, and scurrility to the hands
Of noblenesse and vertue. Could the Fiend

No other Sense or Language to a person
Of her faire Name, and Worth, then such as Ruffians
Would send to strumpets? or it being such.

you, before you heare a short Examination --
Deliver'd you the Letter which I sent
Yesterday to the Damsell that you wot of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes sir, shee read it, kist it a hundred times,
Then made a bosome Idoll on't,
And sayes you are the noblest Gentleman.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hell take her for a mistaking whore,
Shee has the widows Letter, and the widow hers,
I found it sir, when you judiciously
Said it was Ruffian-like, and Strumpet language.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How could you erre so strangely?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O slightly, slightly, curse o' my heedless braine!
And then too be trapp'd with carelesnesse.
When I was so religiously resolv'd,
T'incline to vertue, and a Marriage life,
Thinking with one hand to cast off my follies,
And to take hold of vertue with the other,
For sir, (I will confesse my selfe to you)
The Letter you conveyed was in defiance,
A loose liv'd wanton, intended to a whore,
That impudently hopes an interest in me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was not so directed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I there was
(The Hell confound it on't) my giddines:
I seald both Letters e're I superscrib'd 'em,
And so gave each the contrary direction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sav.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas a grosse carelesnesse, and if you lose
A fortune by't, do not blame your friends.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That fortune should favour a whore before
An honest woman. 'Twas the sweetest Letter,
The daintiest winning things -- (the Devills in't)
Shee must not carry't from the widow so.
Fetch mee the Letter againe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you thinke shee'l part with't sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cannot you beat it out of her sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell how to do that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus sir -- i'le give you demonstration, you
malicious Rogue, you that conspirst with her to betray me, 
so good a Master I have beene to thee, and so good a
friend to her, i'le recompence you both.
<pagebreak id="D6V" />

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You put me in good minde, and if I do not

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I owe you somewhat for your last-nights absence,
too pernicious Villaine that kepst thy selfe out o' the

my self, and the house here all lay o' your absence, There's
somewhat more for that. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beats him.</font> </nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No faith, To speak truth he was as much abus'd
in it, as you in doing a thing as contrary to his vile
conditions, as you did to your noble Name. But I crave
onely your pardon, I know not what I doe besides. This
crosse blow of chance staggers my reason so --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well sir, since I have found the errour, my reason
reconciles me to you, and since it grew out of your equall
intent to cast off the evill, as to embrace the good, I will
re-mediate for you to the widow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Car.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But yet shee'l know I have had a whore. Yet
then you may say, 'tis such a running Disease among
young Gentlemen, that not one of a hundred has scap'd
it, that have prov'd stay'd men afterwards, and very
sober husbands; As looke you yonders one may prove,

for asking money (as appeard afterwards) more then
you brought from the Taverne, and leaving their office

In the strife for these sad causes your Sword being seiz'd

mans generative spirit runs all into braine, and that runs
after covetousnesse too, get wealth, not children. Believe
it, much Nephews helpe belongs to it, and then the

Unkles know it, and give way to it, because stranger

hold up thy head Cuz, wee will not be dasht, nor basht
in a good cause; pray read you Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am now (Lady) in favour with my Unkle,
and in faire possibility of a good Estate, deporting my
selfe (I intend to doe) a civill Gentleman. To which
end (induc'd as well by reason, as by long continued
affections) I tender my selfe to you in the holy
condition of Marriage. If you vouchsafe your consent,
(which is my most earnest request) I shall not onely
declare my selfe a good Husband, but the most 
happy, Geo. Carelesse.</font>

injury to your 
Kinswoman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In flying from his Word, and Deed Madam. He
has borne her in hand these two yeares, and use her at his
pleasure, detaining her from her choyce of many good
fortunes, and at last sends her this to make amends for
all, and denies his act the next day, sending his man to
take the Letter from her, pretending 'twas directed to
another. But never the sooner for a hasty word Cosen,
we will not be dasht nor basht, I warrant thee.
<pagebreak id="E3V" />

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have discretion Madam, and I made choice
of your Ladiship to open this matter unto you, rather
then to Sir <font>Oliver</font> himselfe, whom I would not
willingly exasperate against his Nephew, you may be pleased in
a milder way to temper him, and worke a satisfaction for
my Kinsewoman; Sir <font>Oliver</font> and your selfe Madam, are
noble Customers to my Shop, and for your sakes I would
not deale rigourously with your Kinseman, if a gentle
end may be made. But, if you cannot so compound it,
the Law lies open, money and friends are to be found, a
good cause shall not be sterv'd, I will not be dasht nor
basht, <font> <foreign>Sapientia mea mihi</foreign> </font> is my word, and so good Madam
you know my mind.

and I like her so well at first sight, that I am easily mov'd
to doe good for her, is shee your Kinsewoman in blood
Mr. <font>Saleware</font> , or your wifes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mine I assure your Ladiship, though my wife can
boast as great and noble friends I thank fortune, as the
wife of any Tradesman that carries a head in the City,
(but that's by the by) yet I came of a better house, and am
a Gentleman borne, none disprais'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Mr. <font>Saleware</font> , leave your Kinsewoman with
me a little while, you shall not be seene in my act, i'le try
what I can doe for her.
