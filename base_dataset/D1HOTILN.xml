And my opinion is, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> forasmuch
as euerye thing sheweth nowe a certaine
<pagebreak id="A6V" />
naturall amitie amongst themselues, yea,
the trees, sayeth <font>Plinie</font> , hath a naturall
instinct of friendship, the sweete flowers,
the pleasaunt herbes, declares the same
also, that we intreate somewhat of
friendship, and bicause no friendship, or amitie
is, or ought to be more deere, and surer,
than the loue of man and wyfe, let thys
treatise be thereof, wherein I woulde the
duetie of the married man to be discribed.
For the knowledge of duetie is the 
maintenance of friendship. </dialogue><nonSpeech>All the companie
commended Maister <font>Pedro</font> for this
pleasant deuise, &amp; the Lady <font>Iulia</font> standing vp,
sayd, that forsomuch, as the soueraignetie,
though not with hir will, was
committed vnto hir wyth consent of them all,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and
due obedience promised, I like well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> of thys which Mayster <font>Pedro</font> hath
alreadie deuised, touching friendship, and
duetie of the maried man. Wherefore, by
the same authoritie, which I haue
receyued, I commaunde you Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and turned
hir towardes Maister <font>Pedro</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to performe
this charge, which you haue deuised of the
maried man, not for that I thinke you to
<pagebreak id="A7R" />
be a better husbande, than any of the reast
here. But because we being yet wholy
ignorant in this kinde of pastimes, you
may, as the principall authour thereof,
instruct vs in the whole circumstance: and

<pagebreak id="B1R" />
<omission type="sentence" /> an vnhappie custome
was it, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Lady <font>Iulia</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &amp; likely that
the <font>Flower of Friendship</font> was but
weaklye rooted betweene them of so slender
acquaintance, but I praye you tell vs, how
the indifferent sorte were maried, that
were neyther foule, nor fayre, but louely
browne. Mary, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for such amongst
the <font>Venetians</font> , there was no money either
giuen, or taken, but were maried for
naught. And so perchaunce, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth a merie
gentleman, that stoode by, called Mayster
<font>Gualter</font> of Cawne,</nonSpeech><dialogue> were some of the 
fairest, as they be sometimes nowe a dayes.
I haue also read, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth Maister <font>Pedro</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
that in Fraunce, the maydens did choose
their husbands in this sorte. The parents
called a number of yong men to a banket,
who~ they thought fittest, &amp; him, to whom
the mayde gaue first water, by that signe
she chose for hir husband. In <font>Mauritania</font> ,
as sayeth <font>Diodorus Siculus</font> , there was
such store of women, y=t= euery man might
haue fiue wyfes, and no lesse than three,
which also after y=e= death of their husbands,
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
within one moneth eyther wyllingly
buried themselues with him, or were
perforce executed by the lawe. In the Isles of
<font>Canaria</font> , there were contrariwise so
many men, and so fewe women, that euerie
wife might haue seuen husbandes, &amp; could
not take lesse than fiue. But I trust, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth
the Lady <font>Aloisa</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that those men were not
so kinde harted, as to be buried with their
wyfes, as the women in that other
countrie were with their husbandes. I thinke
not, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth Maister <font>Pedro</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and I doubt
whether those women of <font>Mauritania</font>
coulde not haue beene contented to haue
taried behinde their husbandes, had there
beene no lawe to haue compelled them.

For the best of them all haue their faults,
and if she be vertuous, she will looke to
be so honored, that hir husband shall haue
the more a do to please hir. And I
remember, that a wise man, I knowe not hys
name, being enquired of a friende of hys,
with whome he should marry, aunswered,
that he had beene married foure sundrie
times, first with a fayre woman, who was
so prowde of hir bewtie, that he was faine
to please, and content hir, least she should
dishonour him, the seconde verie riche,
whose substance made hir so stately, that
he was forced lyke a slaue to obey hir, the
thirde was so vertuous, that he was glad
<pagebreak id="B5R" />
to honor, and reuerence hir, to keepe hir
still in hir vertuous goodnesse, the last was
of good lineage, which so exalted hir
stomacke, that shee made him hir bondman.
Nowe choose, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> which of these
foure thou canst best content thy self. You
haue made a fayre reason, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Lady

<comment type="compiler">JULIA CONTINUES: SHE COMES TO THE ISSUE OF OBEDIENCE.</comment>
<pagebreak id="D8R" />
<omission type="line" /> I know not, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth
the Lady <font>Isabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what we are bounde to
do, but as meete is it, that the husbande
obey the wife, as the wife the husband, or at
the least that there bee no superioritye
betwene them, as the auncient philosophers
haue defended. For women haue soules as
wel as men, they haue wit as wel as men,
and more apte for procreation of children,
than men. What reason is it then, that
they should be bound, whome nature hath
made free? Naye, among the <font>Achaians</font> ,
wome~ had such soueraigntie, that
whatsoeuer they commaunded, their Husbandes
obeyed. Yea, <font>Plutarch</font> saith, that the man
swept the house, drest the meate, and did all
other necessaries, where the woman
gouerning the house, and keping the money,
aunswered all matters, and which woorse
was, they corrected them at their discretio~.
<pagebreak id="D8V" />
What did shee, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth Maister <font>Gualter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&amp; might she beate him too? Mary lo. Here
is the matter, that some of our Dames in
this Countrie take so much vppon them.
They think belike that they be in <font>Achaia</font> .
But sure if I had bene amongst those
women: you would haue done, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Ladie 
<font>Isabella</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Isablla</font> </comment> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as they did. For Dogs 
barke
boldely at their owne maisters doore.
Beleue not daughter, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Lady <font>Iulia</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
neither those ignorant Philosophers, nor
these fonde customes. For contrary also to
this, the <font>Parthians</font> , &amp; <font>Thracians</font>
accounted not of their wiues, more than of slaues,
so that after they had borne them a dosen
children, or more, they sold the mothers at
the common markets, or exchaunged them
for yonger. Fye vpon that law, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the
Lady <font>Isabella</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> But what saye you to the
custome which <font>Dionysius Alicarnasseus</font> ,
wryteth of the <font>Numidians</font> and <font>Lydians</font> ,
where the woman commaunded within
doores, and the men without. Yea marie
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Ladye <font>Aloisa</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that was a iust
law, where the commau~ding was equall.
Not so, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Lady <font>Iulia</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> For though
<pagebreak id="E1R" />
it were better than the other two: yet not
tollerable amongst vs, neyther was the
soueraignetie so equallye deuided, as you
thinke. For if the woma~ keepe alwaies hir
house, as duetie is, the man standeth euer
at hir comaundement. For as long as she
is within, though he commaund hir
without, this lawe byndeth hir not to obey.
Wherefore in my opinion al those
<font>Barbarian</font> customes are to be disanulled, and
co~temned of Christians. Ye say well,
Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth M. <font>Erasmus</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> For in deede both
diuine, &amp; humaine lawes, in our religion
giueth the man absolute authoritie, ouer
the woman in all places. And, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the
Lady <font>Iulia</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as I sayde before, reason doth
confirme the same, the man being as he is,
most apt for the soueraignetie being in
gouernement, not onely skill, and experience
to be required, but also capacity to
comprehende, wisdome to vnderstand, strength to
execute, solicitude to prosecute, pacience to
suffer, meanes to sustaine, and aboue all
a great courage to accomplishe, all which
are commonly in a man, but in a woman
verye rare: Then what blame deserue
<pagebreak id="E1V" />
those men that doe permit their wyues to
rule all, and suffer themselues to be
commaunded for company. A hard aduenture,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth Mayster <font>Gualter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> hapneth to that
man, which is matched with a maisterly
shrew. For she being once past shame, not
onely blabbeth out all, that she knoweth,
but thundereth oute that also, which hir
mad head conceyueth, or hir fantasticall
braine dreameth of, and yet will she
maintaine, that she is neuer angrie, or speaketh
without great cause. <omission type="line" />
