<comment type="compiler">DIRECT SPEECH IN THE COURTROOM NOT ALWAYS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM 
INDIRECT SPEECH AND OTHER LEVELS OF DISCOURSE.</comment>

<pagebreak id="2" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>A
Question was moved to the Judge by the E. of Essex, whether
(as in lyke cases as it was allowed by men of private condicon)
they might challenge any of there Peeres, affirminge y=t= though
for his p'te he were verie indifferent, yet p'haps the E. that stoode
by him, might make iuste challenge to some of them. The
Judges said directlie y=t= the lawe did allowe them noe challenge
of their Peeres. The Judges that satt were the Lo. Cheife
Justice of England, the Cheife Justice of the Com~on Plees, the Lo.
cheife Barron, Justice Gawdye, Justice Ffenner, Justice Walmysley,
Baron Clearke and Justice Kyngesmyle: Allso 2 Sergeantes,
M=r= Heale and M=r= Harris. The Queene's Counsell were M=r=
Sergeant Yelverton, M=r= Cooke, Attorney generall, M=r= fflemynge
sollicito=r= and M=r= Bacon: Then said the Clerke of the Crowne,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Robte E. of Essex, hold vp thy hande, </dialogue><nonSpeech>w=ch= he did of a greate
heighte, sayinge he had done it to better p=r='pose: likewise the
E. of South'ton held vp his (so did they) both times, beinge
joyntlie indighted by 2 severall Endightmt=es=: The cheife pointes
<pagebreak id="3" />
were, the rebellinge in Essex house, the sekinge to deprive her
ma=tie= of lyfe and gou'ment, to sett the Crowne vppon his owne
heade, the Consultacon and resolucon to goe to White hall to
su<emendation>r</emendation>pprize her ma=tie=; the imprisoninge the Lo. of the Counsell  
and
others sent from her Ma=tie= to disswade theire traytore purposs,
the p'swadinge the Londoners to ioyne w=th= them and the killinge
the Queene's subiectes. Beinge demaunded guyltie or not guilty
they both answered not guyltie and for tryall put themselves
vpon god and there peeres:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the E. of Essex) </nonSpeech><dialogue> a
true harte to her Ma=tie= and my countrye and have done nothinge
but that w=ch= by the Lawe of nature and the necessitie of my
case I was inforced vnto; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lo. Steward gave the prisoners
to vnderstand that howsoever theire offences were notorious, yet
her ma=tie= was contented to allow them a lawfull and an
honorable tryall: and libertie to speake for themselves. Th'earle of
Essex while the Enditem=tes= were readinge smiled often and lifted
vp his eyes to heavne and after they were redd p'tested him selfe
a trew harted subiect to her ma=tie= and called god to witnes before
Whome (he said) he looked shortelie to appeare. Then M=r= Seriant
Yellverton began to the Lo. Steward (givinge him the tytle of
his grace) to open the matter, makinge firste repeticon of the
substance of th'enditem=tes=: Then vrged the pointes of 
imprisoninge the Lordes at Essex house in w=ch= doinge y=t= appeared 
they
neither respected the Clemencie of her ma=tie= that sente them,
the p'sonns of those that came, nor theire Errand, w=ch= was to
vnderstand theire greifes and to make sinceare report of them to
her ma=tie= and to admonishe the dissolvinge of the vnrulye 
companye there Congregated: All w=ch= notwithstandinge the<emendation>y</emendation>
persisted in theire Rebellious purposes And went into London,
leavinge the Lo. in the custodye of S=r= John Davies, ffraunces
Tresham &amp; Owen Sallisburie, w=th= charge that if either any shold
offer to enlarge them or that the E. of Essex shold miscarrie in
the Cittye then to kyll them. When they came into the Cittye
theye there soughte helpe to attempte the Courte and failinge
there retorned againe to Essex house, there fortifyinge againste
<pagebreak id="4" />
her ma=te's= knowne officers of her Armye, wherein he affirmed
they comitted manifeste treason:</nonSpeech><dialogue> ffor </dialogue><nonSpeech> (sayth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> yf a man 
intend the deathe of a kinge beinge the heade of the comon
welthe w=t=hout w=ch= the members cannot live, it is Treason: they
not onlye intended but allso acted so far forthe as was in there
powre vz: By assemblinge a powre and encitinge the Subiectes
to Rebell, </dialogue><nonSpeech>he compared this facte of the E. of Essex to that of
CATALINE in Roome. CATALINE tooke the most sedicous, the
Earle tooke Atheist, Papiste, men reconcyled to the Pope, men
discontented and of dissolute behavio=r=: the difference was onelye
this that CATALYNE was followed of the Romaines, but noe
Londoners followed the Earle: Then he obiected to the Earle
the Queene's favo=r= towardes him; noe man advanced younger to
place in Counsell nor to more dignities, all w=ch= the Earle abused,
<emendation>and did</emendation> make his cheife companions of sword men, and affectinge  
popularitie declared the infacietie of Ambition, w=ch= never cesseth
till it attayne as highe as it can see, Comparinge it to the 
Crocodyle that is said to growe as longe as he liveth: And these
treasons beinge apparent and knowne to manie of the Peeres, havinge
bene some of them her Ma=te's= Ministers for suppressinge the
Rebellion, he wondred that the Earles wold pleade not guiltie.
Besides theire treasons howsoever sodenlye attempted, were not
so soddainly contrived, But were of a more auncient date as
shold be p'ved. Then M=r= Attornye began to this effect, That
for the better informacon of the Lordes, he wold deliver vnto
them FITZHERBARTE'S reporte, w=ch= was that the verie thoughte
was Treason, but bicause the thoughtes were onely knowne to
god, therefore it is not p'mitted to be adiuged, till they appeare
by some discou'ie either by word, wrytinge or acte, And further
declared that whosoever goeth aboute into open Rebellion, is (in
the construction of the Lawe) guyltie of determing the deathe
and destruction of the Prince.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Th'earle </dialogue><nonSpeech> (sayth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> hathe done
both, for he hath raised a power in a setled govermen=t= w=ch= the
lawe intendes to be a purpose to destroye the kinge, for he y=t=
abusethe the gou'm=t= hates the Governor. The contynuinge
<pagebreak id="5" />
of his power assembled at Essex house being comaunded to
disperse them, is playne Treason. Agayne </dialogue><nonSpeech> (saith M=r= Attorney) </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
to
rayse force to take a Towne, forte or place of defence is Treason:
the E. of Essex raised a force not to take a small Towne but the
verie Cittye of London: not a slend=er= fforte but y=e= Towre, nor
there to rest, but to attempt the sacred Pallace of the Prince,
killinge her subiectes after a most disloyall mane=r=. What shold
I say more, <foreign>Res ipsa loquitur</foreign> . But what answeres my Lo. of
Essex? that the Lawe of nature comaunndes and he was bound
to his owne defence. But I will shewe that he transgressed the
Lawes both of God &amp; Nature and of reacon's. Consider first
the Quallitie of the offence, 2 the manner 3 the p'sons by whome
4 the p'sons against whome it was comitted, and they shall be
lefte w=t=hout excuse. And ffirst let me tell them, that Treason for
satisfacon of a passion in Nature is noe excuse to Treason. All
offences gainst God and nature, are <foreign>peccata clemantia peccata
Sanguinis</foreign> : Rebellion worst of all confoundes all Nature, God
and reacons. This Treason is for y=e= quallitie p'meditate and
aymed at the heade, even of her Ma=tie=: ffor the manno=r= howe 
soddaine soev=er= yet it is highe Treason: ffor soddaine Treason is
not les daungero=s= then y=t= w=ch= is of longer growth. But my Lo.
yo=r= offence was past an imaginerie offence, it was <foreign>Armata
iniquitas</foreign> ; neither was it of that soddaines as yo=u= wold have it
beleeved, ffor yo=u= wore a black bag about yo=r= necke conteininge a
Catologue of the names of such as were mene of yo=r= number: a black
bagg was meetest for such a black cause: But my Lo. there lyes
a greate burthen vppon yo=r= Lo=p= for drawinge so many worthye
gent. into so desp'ate and detestable a busines. ffor the p'sons
by whome thes Treasons were comitted, they received there
first breath vnd=er= her mat=ie's= gou'nm=t=: Th'earldome of Essex
given to his father by her ma=tie=; howe she hath loaden this man
w=th= hono=ers=, offices and dignities, the world can testifie       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (there he
recyted all his offices):</nonSpeech><dialogue> above all her ma=tie's= favo=res= made   
him
greate, neither was it fruitles to his estate: for I am able to
p've and make good accompte that her ma=te's= guiftes to him
<pagebreak id="6" />
amounted to 300 thousand poundes. Allso the Earle of South:
received divers favo=res= from her ma=tie=, thoughe for his
misdemeano=res= it pleaseth her to thinke worse of him. The p'son
against whome thes treasons were intended was against her sacred
ma=tie=, against the Relligion w=ch= her highenes sincerely p'fesseth
at home and p'tecteth in other provinces: and her exercise of
Justice comixed w=th= admirable mercy, w=ch= is aparant in this, that
in the examinacon of all the p'sons imp'soned for this facte, none
were rackte nor offer of fortune made vnto them. And an other
thinge materiall to be noted comes into my mynde, no two of
the examinantes spake togither &amp; yet they all agree in y=e= 
substance of theire tales. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he declared the lenitye of the first
p'ceedinge vz: that</nonSpeech><dialogue> the Lo=es= of the Counsell put vnto them 2
Counsello=res= of State to summon him; the reason because there
was a Roytous company assembled, The intent to admonish him,
he cam<emendation>e</emendation> not, was forborne till the next day y=t= a guilty        
conscience
counselled him to put himselfe into strengthe: ffor there were
forces expected from Wales, y=e= discou'ie whereof th'earle nowe
doubted &amp; Consultacon was had amongst them 3 monthes before
whether was best, first to surprize the Tower and Court, or to
p've there freindes in London. Allso at Drewrie house, it was
resolved vppon 4 daies before theie brake owte into open rebellion
y=t= to goe to y=e= Courte was y=e= best: then was allotted to eurie 
one his severall place of charge, S=r= Christopher Blunt, a reconcyled
Papist, to haue charge of the vtter gate, S=r= John Davies the Hall,
a Papist likewise &amp; S=r= Charles Davers the presence, a secret
Papist (as is confessed), Th'erle of Essex the privye Chamber:
Should the Court have bene thus guarded, oh (saith) S=r= 
Christopher Blunt, what fearefull humo=er= shall we fynde them in at
Courte when we surprize them. Well what shold be the end of
y=e= surprize? forsoothe to call a p'liament. A bloody parliam=t=
wold that haue bene when yo=r= Lo=p= that nowe standeth all in
black, shold haue worne a bloody Robe. But my hope is y=t= he
shalbe Robte the laste Earle of his house that wold have bene
Robte the first Kinge of this land. Well what did he? he
<pagebreak id="7" />
assembles a greate number of Barons, Earles and gent. of
Quallitie, yet her ma=tie= held gracous and sent vnto him favo=r=    
vz. the
Lo. Keep: th'earle of Worcester, the Comptroller and the Lo.
Cheife Justice, two of them of his owne blood, th'other, men that
never malliced him, as himselfe will (I thinke) confess. Thes
charged him vpon his alledgiaunce, to lay downe his Armes and
to disolve his troupe. Nowe marke the fury of a rebellious
company, They cried owte kill them, kill them, we shall have the less
to doe, they but abuse and goe aboute to betraye yo=u=: here you
see Treason in the house: before he went owte he was a Trayto=r=:
when he came into the Citty whatt did he? even followed the
rules of Treason: Treason durst never looke directlye vppon a
Prince, for the Ma=tie= of godes annoynted doth ever cast forth such
beames as daunteth the eye of disloyaltie and therefore he
p'tendes a cause of stirringe the State, Or (saith he) at firste
entraunce I shold haue bene murthered by my Lo. Cobham and
S=r= Walter Raleighe but when he was gott w=t=hin them &amp; began to
speake nearer to them, then an other cause was invented, vz. y=t=
the Kingdome of England sholde be soulde to the INFANTA of 
Spayne: In the end fyndinge in London truer hartes then he
expected, he resolved vppon his retorne, what to doe? to burne
some pap'r least they shold hurte his freindes: </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then M=r=
Atto=r=ney besoughte the Lo. Howard y=t= certaine deposicons might be
redd for proofe of thes matters. Th'earle replied y=t= there was
oddes betweene the memorie and Oratorie of the QUEENE'S
con~sell and theires that were prisoners, and that it belonged to
the Q. counsell to lay all possible as'p'sions vppon those at that
Barr. And desired the Peeres to consider of theire woordes
accordinglie. Then was p'duced the examinacon of one
Witherington a borderer of Wales, that the Saterdaie before he tould
th'erle of Rutland that he wondred at the Course he held w=th= y=e=
State. Th'erle of Essex tooke some excepcon to him in respecte
he was not p'sent, but (as he said) p'tested the sinceritye of his
Relligion: And for the threates vsed to the Lordes, he never
hard them, the house beinge so full of noyse that one could not
<pagebreak id="8" />
heare an other speake: some cryed one thinge and some another,
as everie p'ticular humour ledd them. But for his owne p'te he
never ment any thinge towarde them, but y=t= w=ch= was loyall,
shuitable and affectionate: ffor S=r= John Davyes he p'tested
deeply he never knewe him not to be a papist, he came orderly
to prayers in his house, neither observed he in him any difference
of his dress. The charge of his house when he wente owte he
lefte w=th= S=r= Gellie Marwick, who had once beene his Steward and
nowe was his ffreind &amp; that w=ch= he did he was forced vnto in his
owne iuste defence, for he understoode, not by a naked surmise
but by sound adu'tisem=t= that his private Enemyes had levied force
and ment to surprize him in his house: he allso p'tested deeplie
the sincerity of his harte towarde her Ma=tie= and his Countrye and
wished that all disloyall hartes mighte haue the reward dew vnto
them. Then the Lo. Admirall desired the Lo. Cheife Justice to
declare his knowledge of what passed in Essex house at his beinge
there w=th= the rest: whereuppon he was sworne and then spake to
this effecte, That they were sent to them to drawe them to a
better course and to informe trulye at Courte, the matters
whereat they tooke offence. They required of th'erle of Essex
to know his greifes, w=th= p'mise to reporte them sincearlie.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My
Lo. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (sayth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> began to tell us that one was touchinge th'erle 
of
South: in whiche instant one at my back, cryed owte kyll them,
kill them: he said he knewe him not yf he sawe him agayne, but
he was suer he had on a white Sattin doblett. </dialogue><nonSpeech>That they
desired private conference, where to th'erle answered that he
wold come to them anon. But at the dore were set
Musketeres to guarde the place, and none was suffered to goe owte from
them to reporte in what plight they were. The E. of Essex
replyed againe that he was far from any daungerous thought
towardes his Lo=p= or any of the rest w=th= him, whome he had
before tyme esteemed as his speciall freindes. he sawe indeede
that the comaundm=t= of Allegiaunce could not p'tecte the E. of
South: from the late iniurye done him by my Lo. Greye, and
therefore resolved to stand vppon his guard, havinge y=e= same       
adu'tisem=t=
<pagebreak id="9" />
on the Sat=er=day night y=t= his private enemyes were in armes
against him &amp; the same seconded on the Sondaye morninge by
p'sons worthye the beleevinge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> but </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for any intent 
of
treason towarde her Ma=tie= or the State, I am cleare and I can
avowe asmuch for the rest there p'sent. But my Lo. Steward
and the rest of yo=r= Lop=s=, I wold not that yo=u= shold mistake    
me in
this, as if I went aboute to saue my Lyfe: no, I despise it and am
at peace w=th= god and have forgott the world, beinge more
desirous to dye then to live. That w=ch= I speake is rather in       
satisfacon
of this nobleman that standeth by me and the rest that are
engaged w=th= me, whose hartes are purely affected and whose
bodyes are able to serve theire sou'aigne and their countrye.
But to confirme in me the doubte of beinge s=r'=prised in my house,
S=r= Walter Raleighe pleaded S=r= fferdinando Gorges to leave vs or
he was lost, tould him that he came owte of a sinkinge ship.
And the adviser on Saterday night and Sunday morninge, came
not from light and vayne reportes but from an honorable
adu'tisem=t=. But my Lordes </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue had very uniust
courses vsed against me, Papists soughte owte to accuse, as Tho.
Blunt, and one Sudall a Preiste, Allsoe Bales a Scrivener
confessed to me and others that he counterfeited my hand twelve
tymes. What measure might I then expect from such begininge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>To that M=r= Attorney spake that it was true y=t= Bales was hired
therevnto by a s'vant of th'earles, one John Danyell to th'intent
that if afterwardes the E. owne hand were p'duced to accuse him
he mighte have somewhat to allege for him selfe. Heere the Lo.
Greye stoode vp and p'tested he did not nowe mallice the E. of
South: ffor he delighted not to presse an abiecte ffortune. That
w=ch= he offered him in the sheete was in respect of a newe iniurye</nonSpeech><dialogue>
w=ch= </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= the E. of South:) </nonSpeech><dialogue> was never ment yo=u=. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lo. 
Steward
comaunded an ende of that speeche, tendinge but to private
expostulacon. Then was redd the deposicon of S=r= fferdinando
Gorges to this effect, viz. that he received a l're from the E. in
January last, either to come vp to London or to meete in some
place the 2 of ffebruary. At his cominge the E. told him he
<pagebreak id="10" />
stoode vppon his guard, that he ment to trust no longer, but he
resolved to defend himself from restrainte. Tould him further
that he was confident in London, and liked not that the Lordes
shold be his int=r=cess=rs=, allsoe that he resolved to call a       
Parliam=t=
havinge once gayned secure access at Courte. That he had a
stronge p'ty in Wales, but first ment to try London. That he the
sayd S=r= ffer.<emendation>dinando Gorges</emendation> came from his charge at Plymouth
w=t=hout leave, w=ch= beinge knowne to S=r= Walter Raleighe his      
kinsman
and frend, S=r= Walt=er= sent for him to come speake w=th= him: they
appointed to meete vppon the water on Sunday morninge, the
verie day that the E. of Essex began to stirr. And there
meetinge, S=r= Wa. Ra: told him that he wished him to dep'te the
towne p'sently, or otherwise he wold be layde in the fleete,
whereto he replyed, tush S=r= Wa. this is not a tyme of goinge to the
fleete, gett yo=u= backe to the Courte and that w=th= speede, for    
yo=u=
are lyke to haue a bloody day of y=t=, wherevpon S=r= Walter againe
advised him to come forth of that company. And then S=r= fferd.
Gorges shoved of the Boate wherein S=r= Wa. Ra: was and bad him
hye him there, w=ch= he did p'ceavinge a boate to come of<emendation>f</emendation> at
Essex house stayres, wherein were 3 or 4 of the E. of Essex
s'vantes, with peeres who had in charge either to take or kill S=r=
Wa. Ra: vppon the water. ffor the first p'te of theire meetinge
vppon the water S=r= Wa. Ra: was deposed in Courte to the same 
effecte. The E. of Essex desired to heare S=r= fferd. Gorges face to
face, wherevppon he was sent for, and there delivered as much,
addinge further that he desired the E. of Essex at his retorne, to
goe and submitt himself; whereat the E. excepted w=th= this
speeche or to the like effecte.</nonSpeech><dialogue> S=r= fferd. Gorges I wish yo=u=    
shold
speake any thinge that shold do yo=r= self good, but remember
that yo=u= are a gent. and that yo=r= reputacon oughte to be deare
vnto yo=u=. I pray yo=u= answere, did yo=u= advise me to cease my
enterprise? My Lo. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke I did. Nay </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth    
E.) </nonSpeech><dialogue> it is
no=w= not tyme to answere vppon thinkinge, did yo=u= indeede so
counsell me? </dialogue><nonSpeech>he answered</nonSpeech><dialogue> I did. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The E. pausing as it were in a
wond=er= replyed thus.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, let his lyfe and my death witnes
<pagebreak id="11" />
howe truely he speakes. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then was agayne vrged the
Consultation at Drewery house, at w=ch= was p'sent the E. of South:
whereto the E. of South: relyed w=th= p'testation of all loyaltie
in his harte towarde her Ma=tie=. And in that he had offended
her, he was hartely sory, and did in all humblenes beseeche
her p'don. But touchinge the consultation at Drewery house,
many thinges were indeede p'pounded but nothinge resolved,
all beinge lefte in the ende to the E. of Essex himself.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> put the case as yo=u= wold haue it, that it was     
advised both
to attempt the Courte and Towre att once, neither of the two 
was done: how can it then be made treason? It is true we did
consult at Drewry house, about securinge the E. of Essex his
arrest free from impeachm=t= and that for noe other end, but to
p'strate o=r= selves at her mat=e's= ffeete, humblie submittinge     
o=r= selves
to her m=er=cye, and laying forth our greifes to her self, whereof
we thought she had noe true informacon from others. this was
the end of o=r= meetinge, and not w=th= any treasonable thought of
my p'te. I take god to record, and </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire the     
opinion
of the Judges, whether one thinge consulted vppon and an other
executed be Treason, ffor we talkte of goinge to the Courte, the
Towre allso was talked vppon, but the counsell was reiected,
and this yo=u= will haue to be treason. ffor my p'te I knewe
nothinge in the morninge when I came to Essex house of o=r=
goinge into London. when I was in London I hard not the
p'clamacon, I was not neare by the lengthe of the streete. Let
my Lo. Burleigh speake (I knowe him hon=or=able) whether he
sawe me in London or not. I never drewe my sword all the
daye. I am charged to carry a pistoll: I had none when I went
owte. when I came into London I sawe one havinge a pistoll.
I desired it of him and had it. But it had never a stone nor cold
it have hurte a flye. At my retorne into Essex house I did there
what I could to hind=er= the shootinge, and for that ende sent Capt.
White about the house. ffrom this kinde of behavio=r= can be
gathered noe thoughtes of Treason, and therefore I beseech yo=u=
my Lordes, to censure me not accordinge to the letter of the
<pagebreak id="12" />
Lawe but as in yo=r= trewe consciences yo=u= are p'swaded of me,
And in that I was to<emendation>o</emendation> farr carryed w=th= love to my Lo. of Essex
I confesse to haue offended, that before rehersed beinge the
onely drift and scope of my purpose in this busines. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Hereto
M=r= Attorney replyed y=t= it was <foreign>palliata Conclusio</foreign> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue>

can be satisfied so longe as any greatnes is left vnatchived. but
know this for certaine, that to make the Courte or Tower a
defence for private enemyes is playne Treason. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The E. of South:
replied that the Towre was reiected as a matter ridiculous to be
thought vppon: neither was it ment to fortifie at courte, but
onely to cast them selves at her Ma=te's= feete. The Judges were
required theire sev'rall opinions for the Question before p'pounded
by the E. of South: who argued it sev'ally, and agreed that it
was Treason. My Lo. Admyrall desired to be resolved whether
the instructions for a consultacon to be had at Drewry house
were under the E. of Essex owne hands: Then was p'duced
and redd in Courte the examinacon of S=r= Charles Davers to this
effect, that the Earle of Essex deliberated before Christmas, to
secure his accesse to her Ma=tie= from possibility of resistance, to
posses himselfe of the Courte, the p'iect of the Earle of Essex,
his owne hand, to surprise the Capt. of the guard, the Courte
beinge taken to send to satisfye the Cittye, to call a p'liam=t=, and
to bringe his enemyes to an honorable tryall: That he wished
<pagebreak id="13" />
the E. to flye w=th= 2 or 3 gent. and for his owne goinge to the
consultacon at Drewrie house, he was drawne there vnto, by the
love he bare to the E. of South: to whome he ought his lyfe.
he confesseth that he advised to seize the halbertes in the Guarde
Chamber, w=ch= done they shold w=th= ease enoughe posses that place,
beinge p'swaded to fynde many indifferent havinge bene the E.
of Essex his s'vantes in tymes past. Then was red the Ex. of S=r=
Christ. Blunt, to this effect, At the first his wounde hindred him,
but p'mised that when he was able to speake he wold tell all
trewlye, And beinge then Ex. before my Lo. Admyrall and M=r=
Secretarie, he confessed the p'iecte to be as hath bene before
described. he affirmed that the E. of Essex had a purpose to alter
the gou'm=t=, and in communicacon w=th= him, the E. said that he
liked not that any man shold be troubled for Religion, That the
E. sent Wiseman to his wife w=th= a letter of Complaint into the
Countrye, requestinge him allso to come to London the xx=th= of
Januarye accordinge to appointm=t=. The E. of Essex answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
yo=u= p'duce heere Ex. of wittnesses against me, they are in like
state as I am, they speake like men desirous to live, they testifye 
against me. What reward doe they hope for? Lyfe. I wish 
that w=ch= they speake may purchase that vnto them. ffor I never
ment to Endaunger any of theire lives, howsoever I speede this
daye. it is to me a thinge indifferent. I am not in Love w=th=
my Lyfe, nor have bene a longe tyme. I could haue bene
contented to haue dyed in my house when I was besett: But I
thancke Allmightie God, that he hath reserved me to this daye's
tryall: But I was driven to this hazard by those that have the
Queene's care and doe abuse it, inforcinge againste me many
vntruthes, w=ch= knowinge I choose rather to hazard her Ma=te's=
mercy: then to abide the daungerous courses that shold run
against me. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Beinge demaunded who were those p'sonnes at w=ch=
he cheiflye aymed, he answered M=r= Secretarie Cecill, the Lo.
Cobhm~ and S=r= Walt=er= Raleighe, against whome he had iust
cause of exceptons, as wold haue diverted her Ma=te's= favor from 
them. ffor the matter of his goinge into London, he knewe not
<pagebreak id="14" />
th'int=er=p=r='tacon of the same, but his owne harte he knewe to be
cleare of the leaste stayne of disloyaltie to his sou'aigne. The
Lo. Cobhm~ arose and excused himself of any mallice to the E.
and p'tested to have onely dislyked his ambitious courses, w=ch=
could not but breede daunger to the State, in w=ch= respect he
ought to hind=er= there growthe. The Lo. Steward cut of<emendation>f</emendation> his
speeche, affirmyng that the matter alledged by the E. was
imp'tinent, and willed them to p'ceede to the Judgm=t= that was
in hand. The E. of Essex not w=th=standinge replied that in his
opinyon he was not alone, but he was fortified by the opinion of
honorable p'sons. Then M=r= Bacon spake to this effect:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I
expected not </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that the matter of defence shold have  
bene
alledged for excuse, therefore I must allter my speeche from that
I entended. To Rebell in Defence, is a matter not hard of;
in case of Murder, defence is a good Plea, but in this case, to
doe all that was done that daye, and then to goe abowte to
blamich it, I cannot allowe: I speake not nowe to simple men,
I speake to them that can drawe p'se owte of the nature of the 
thinges themselves. It is knowne by bookes, by experience and
by common talke, that noe Lawfull intendimt=es= are bent
directlie againste the Prince, but there is a walteringe of gou'm=tes=
(as the phrase is in Scottland). thes goe noe way but by
p'ticular Iniuries. My Lo=rs=, I cannot resemble yo=r= p'ceedinges
more rightlie then to y=t= of Pisistratus in Athens, who launched
himself to th'intent that by the sighte of bleedinge woundes, the
people might beleve he was set vppon: Yo=r= Lop. gave owte
that yo=r= lyfe was soughte by the Lo. Cobham and S=r= Wa. Ra:
and carried allwayes such a shewe of religion in yo=u= that mens

<pagebreak id="15" />
Essex interrupted him and sayde, that the speeche of M=r= Bacon,
gave him occasion to alledge him selfe against him selfe.</nonSpeech><dialogue> ffor
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (saith he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> M=r= Bacon beinge a daylie Courtier, and havinge

w=ch= he shold shewe the Queene. Gosnole broughte me both the

those enemyes and pointed them owt as plainely as was 
possible. </dialogue><nonSpeech>M=r= Bacon answered that thes digressions were not fitt,
neither wold be suffered, but that the hono=r= and patience of
this assemblie was greate: he confessethe <emendation>he</emendation> had spent more

it be

was informed by those of good Credditt, that an honorable,
grave, and wise Counsello=r= did with teares lament the co=r=ses they
were takinge, that besides for that I spake in London, that the
INFANTA of Spayne was intytled to the succession: I had reason,
ffor it was tould me that M=r= Secretarye so sayde to one of his
fellow Counsello=rs=, that the INFANTA'S tytle Compativelie, was
as good as any other in the succession. Allso I sawe soe many
oppressions in the State, y=t= I was desirous to sacrifice my selfe in
the redresse thereof by doinge any thinge that a Loyall subiecte
mighte to doe them w=th=. </dialogue><nonSpeech>M=r= Secretarye beinge present besought
the Lo. Steward vppon his knee to give him leave to answere the
E. of Essex, w=ch= he seemed loathe to doe as not beleevinge what
the E. had taxed him w=t=hall: and the Peeres made one
semblance of givinge light credditt thereunto. M=r= Secretarye began
to this effecte.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lo. ffor witt I give yo=u= the p'eminence, yo=u=
have it aboundantlie. ffor birthe I give yo=u= place. I am not
noble, yet I am a gent: neither am I a sword man. Yo=u= haue
therefore the oddes of me. Butt I have inocencye to p'tect me
<pagebreak id="16" />
from yo=r= malicious slander, and I stand here in the p'son of an
honest man: yo=u= there in the p'son of a Trayto=r=. Wherefore I
do here challenge yo=u= yf yo=u= dare, to name vnto this honorable
assembley, that Counsell=r= to whome I shold speake those wordes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>The E. replyed w=th= a kynde of frowne to be dared, that they all
knewe he had not named one man, that daye for an other,
neyther wold he.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r= Secret:) </nonSpeech><dialogue> it must be        
beleeved to
be a ficcon. No </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= the Earle) </nonSpeech><dialogue> it is not, for the noble man 
that
standeth by me hard it: and it was told ioyntlie to vs both.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then M=r= Secretary said to the E. of South: in effecte, as
followeth,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if it be so then, my Lo. I coniure yo=u= by all the love
and frendshipp that hath bene betwixte vs, and as yo=u= are a
Christian: by the hono=r= of yo=r= name and howse and whatsoever
else yo=u= hold honorable, as I p'test I holde yo=u= severed from him
in impudencye, that yo=u= name here the Counsell=r= to whome I
shold speake it. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The E. of South: answered, that he referred
himself to that honorable Courte, whither it were fytt for hym,
in the case he nowe stoode, to name him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I refer me </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th=      
he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> to
yo=r= self S=r=, and if you will say vppon yo=r= hono=r= y=t= it     
were fitt I
did name him, I will. I p'test </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r= Secret:) </nonSpeech><dialogue> before you 
and
heaven, that yow should <emendation>do</emendation> yo=r= Prince and Countrye a most
acceptable s'vice, for I were a verie vnworthye man to hold that
place I doe in the State if I were to be touched in that sorte.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Earle of South: named S=r= Willm. Knolles to be
the Counsello=r= to whome he shold so speake. Then (M=r= Secret:)
vppon his knee besoughte the Lo. Steward that S=r= Willm
Knollis might be sent for, w=ch= was graunted. And M=r= Secretarie
p'ceeded in an open p'testacon, that he never hated the p'son of
the E. but his ymodderate aspiring. That he had told the
Queene since my Lo. restreinte at my Lo. Keep=r=, y=t= he hoped y=t=
this late affliccon wold fitt hym to her Ma=tes= service, and did but
attend a fitt tyme, to move her Ma=tie= to call him agayne to the 
Courte. Then the Q. Counsell p'ceeded to the Evidence,
obiectinge to the E. of Essex his cold hipocrisie, for as much as
havinge in his house contynuall preachinge, he yet was contented
<pagebreak id="17" />
to S=r= Christ. Blunt: to p'mise a tolleracon of Religion. To that
the E. answered, y't he knewe S=r= Christ. Blunt to be a PAPIST
and had often sought his con'ion and (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> beinge in speeche
together aboute those matters, oh (q=th= S=r= Chr. Blunt), my Lo. you
are in passion against those of my p'fession: whereunto I answered,
did you never knowe y=t= at such tyme as I had power in the
State, I was willinge noe man shold be trobled for his conscience.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>the E. of South: besought leave to speake, and spake to this
effecte.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I was ignorant </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> of the Lawes, therefore   
mighte
easely transgress the bondes thereof. The first and onely motive
that <emendation>led to</emendation> my stirr w=th= my Lo. was my love to my Lord, tyed   
vnto
him both by the bondes of Allegiance and his manifold des'tes
towardes me. In respect whereof I was content to indure w=th=
him the utmost hazard: for I sawe his case verie desp'ate for
fav=or= &amp; therefore I consulted w=th= others to steere his passage to
her Ma=tie=. I p'test before allmightie God for noe other end then
to p'strate o=r=selves at her ffeete, wherein was never mencon made
of sheddinge one drop of blood, And if in this my affection, I
have bene transported beyond the Limittes of the Lawe, and
that her highenes is displeased therew=th=, I doe in all humblenes
crave her p'don and mercye, wherein I will never dispaire. I 
hope her Ma=tie=, beinge Gode's Leivetenante vppon earthe, will
imytate him in Lookinge to the Earle and not condemne me for
that, wherein onely through ignoraunce of her Lawes I have
offended. </dialogue><nonSpeech>heere M=r= Secre: beinge moved w=th= a deepe touche of
ymputacon layde vppon hym by the Lo. of Essex, humbly desired
leave to move the Courte, w=ch= graunted, he spake as followeth.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
S=r= Willm. Knollis </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> is sent for. I knowe not by what 
messenger, neither whether he will come or not. I therefore
beseech yo=r= grace y=t= some sure gent. may be sent as hath free
access to her Ma=te's= p'son, and y=t= may p'sent vnto her my humble
desire that it wold please her to comaunde him to come, and in
my opinion this gent. that standes here, M=r= Knyvett, a gent. of
her Ma=te's= preivy Chamber, were a verie meete man. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lo.
Steward, <emendation>and</emendation> the 7 Peeres consented. then M=r= Secretarie turned.
<pagebreak id="18" />
his speeche to M=r= Knyvett to this effecte.</nonSpeech><dialogue> M=r= Knivet goe and
deliver faithfullie this messuage to her Ma=tie= &amp; I further coniure
yo=u= as yo=u= are a gent. and do tend=r= yo=r= reputacon, by all    
o=r= Love
and by y=e= dutye yo=u= owe to o=r= Sou'aigne and Conterye, that     
yo=u=
add this further from me to her Ma=tie=, That if either owt of want 
of care of me, or content to her self, she shall deny to send him, I
doe here vowe vppon my salvacon, that I will never s've her as a
Counsello=r= or Secretarie, but will live and dye her subiect and
vassaile. I pray you forgett not to deliver it w=th= this p'viso, that
I will dye her vassayle and subiect. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then they p'ceeded againe
to the Evidence. And it was demaunded by M=r= Attorney of
the Judges to resolve the Courte whether to offer by force to
remove anye of her Ma=te's= Counsell be Treason or not? And it
was answered to be treason. Allso, whether for a subiecte to
make his passage to the presence of his prince by force vppon
her Courte or Counsell were Treason, or not? It was likewise
adiudged treason. Then it was vrged by M=r= Attorney, that
it was playne, that force was vsed, for foure of the Queene's
subiectes were slayne, allso the attempt of the Courte was
resolved at Drewry house. Whereto the E. of South: replyed,
That the resolucon was not testified by S=r= Charles Davers.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r= Attorney).</nonSpeech><dialogue> But S=r= John Davis witnesseth a plain
resolucon, </dialogue><nonSpeech>wherevppon was redd the examinacon of S=r= John Davies, 
to
that effect, and in the rest agreeinge w=th= the others. Then the Lo.
Admirall stoode vp and tooke witnesse of the Lo=res= there present
that there was noe losse of men till seven of the Clocke, on the
Sondaye, at w=ch= tyme they vnd=er='stoode at Courte howe thinges    
passed
at Essex house, And therefore it was not likelye the E. of Essex
shold stir vp any such doubte. The E. of Essex w=th= p'testacon
that not to save his owne lyfe, w=ch= he cared not for, but to
deliver a trouth, for theire sakes that were ingaged w=th= him,
Affirmed againe that he was twice informed of a force levied,
and for the matter of force obiected in killinge the Q=ues= subiectes,
he p'tested it was much against his mynde. And that the bloode
of his Count=er=ye men was verie deare vnto him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Neither </dialogue><nonSpeech> (sayd
<pagebreak id="19" />
he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> did I ever drawe my sworde, till I was charged at Ludgate,
where I was shott twice in the hatt. I was told my Lo. of
Cumberland was there. I desired to speake w=th= him and to
make my self be vnd=er='stoode of him. And for that end willed
the Company that was w=th= me to stay. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then was S=r= John
Luson deposed, to whome was comitted the charge of Ludgate,
that no messuage came to him from the E. after the first shott,
w=th= many other circumstances of the E. behavio=r=, of the killinge
of the waytes there &amp;=c=. In this meane while S=r= W=m= Knollis was
come. And there in open courte did release M=r= Secretarye of
the speeches, and to put the matter quite owte of doubte, he said
that there was a sedicous booke sett out, vnder the name of one
Dallman, w=ch= very corruptly disputed the tytle of the succession,
derivinge it as Lawfull vppon the INFANTA, as any other.
And M=r= Secretarye and he beinge in talke aboute that booke,
M=r= Secret: spake to this effecte,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it not a straunge impudency
in that Dallman to give equall righte in the succession of 
England, to the Infanta as to any other. herevppon </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r=
Comptroller) </nonSpeech><dialogue> was grownded the sclaunder of M=r= Secretarye,
whereof he is as cleare as any man here p'sent. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Earle of
Essex replied, that it was tould them in an other sence.</nonSpeech><dialogue> noe my
Lo. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r= Secretarye) </nonSpeech><dialogue> yo=r= Lo. owt of yo=r= mallice to  
me desires
to make me odious, and of yo=r= mallice haue noe other ground,
then the breath betwene vs of the peace w=th= Spayne, w=ch= I
labored for the good and quyett of my Countrye, as for my
affection to advaunce a Spanyshe tytle to England, I am so far
from y=t=, that I hate to think of it. And I pray god to consume
me where I stande, If I doe not hate the Spanyard as much as
any man lyvinge. But w=th= yo=u= it hath ever bene a MAXIME, to
pr'fer warr before peace, in respecte of the consequence to yo=r=
followers, and dependers. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Divers other speeches passed betweene
them, w=ch= I remember not. Then they p'ceeded agayne to the 
matter, And there were red the Examinacons of the E. of
Rutland, Lo. Cromwell and Lo. Sandes. The E. of Rutlandes was
to this effecte That he came to Essex house one the Sonday
<pagebreak id="20" />
morninge and it was then told him that the E. of Essex lyfe was
soughte by the Lo. Cobh'm and S=r= Wa. Ra: that the E. of Essex
told him that the Cittye stoode for hym, and that Sheriffe
Smithe had p'mised to rayse him as many men as he could.
That in London the E. of Essex made a speeche to the 
Townesmen, and in the end thereof told them,  that they shold arme
them, for that the Kingdome was offered to be sold to the
Infanta. And said, they did him harme in comynge forthe 
naked. The E. of Essex interrupted the Clerk of the Crowne,
beseechinge the Peeres, to note the weaknes of the E. of
Rutlandes tale, who named neither tyme nor place and w=t=hall
p'tested that he sent for noe man. Then was alledged, that he
wrought for the E. of Sussex vnder p'tence to come and meete
w=th= a number of his ffreindes (as the E. himselfe there p'sent
confessed). The E. of Essex answered, that he had a desire to
satisfye all the honorable spirittes of England (in w=ch= number he
tooke his Lo=p=) that the messuage to the Lo. Mayor was either to
come or to send to Sheriffe Smithe's, into whose handes they
wold put themselves, to be cutt in peeces, if they shold attempt
any thinge vnlawfullie.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And make me </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> as wicked as  
owte
of any hum=r= of yo=r= harte yo=u= wold make me, yet yo=u= shall not
make me absurd to goe into the Cittye after such a fashion as
yo=u= describe yf I had not apprehended an ymminent daunger.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then was farther vrged, that the E. of Rutland had confessed
that the E. of Essex was spurred forwards by the E. of South:
(who whispered him in the eare) It was allso obiected to the E.
of South: by M=r= Attorney that he was a PAPIST: and had had
conversation w=th= Preistes: whereto the E. of South: answered
that for the first matter, the E. of Rutland might mistake,
affirmynge that he onely wished my Lo. of Essex to goe vp into
a chamber: And for the last it was very uniustly vrged, for he
tooke vppon his salvacon that he never knewe Preiste, but only
one Wright, and w=th= hym he never conversed in all his Lyfe, and
yf it could be otherwise p'ved he desired to dye. The Lo. 
Cromwell's Ex. was he knewe nothinge tyll Sunday morninge,
<pagebreak id="21" />
when seeinge the E. of E. pass by his lodginge in ffleete streete,
he followed hym into London. he hard the E. of Essex cry for
all yo=r= good my maisters, that the Realme shold be soldd &amp;=c=.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nay my Lo. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r= Attorney) </nonSpeech><dialogue> howsoever yo=u= goe aboute to
cloake matters, and to make a p'tence of an innocente harte,
these Deposicons of men of yo=r= owne companye admytt noe
contradiction: And I wond=er= not at yo=r= denyall, for yo=u= will   
appeare
to be of all religions, one while Papist, an other while a Puritaine,
and that but to gayne vnto yo=r= selfe all sortes of people. It will
allso be p'ved that yo=u= have practized w=th= Tyrone: </dialogue><nonSpeech>To that the
E. answered he could not p've it: he defyed all the world for y=t=
matter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r= Attorney) </nonSpeech><dialogue> yo=u= sent Lea to him as   
he hath
confessed. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Earle againe denied it, affirminge that it was far
from him to trust Lea in such a busines.</nonSpeech><dialogue> yes </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= M=r=        
Attorney) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
and it shall appeare, that Lea had direction from you to attempt
the Queene, for the w=ch= he was executed as a Trayto=r= the other
daye. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The E. answered that he never sett him a worke, nor
never heard that he was apprehended till M=r= Warburton told it
him. And to the former obiection of M=r= Attorneye touchinge
his relligion, he p'tested that he never was sectarie, and then
excused himself of havinge delte against the Bishops: havinge
beene in his younge tyme ledd theretoe by some hott spirittes,
w=ch= since are growne to a better temper. And for Papistrie, he
doubted not but all the worlde wold cleare him from that
ymputacon. The Lo. Sandes his Examinacon was redd to this effecte,
vz. that he came to Essex house aboute vi. a clocke in the 
morninge, And went w=th= the E. of Essex to Sheriffe Smithe's house,
and stayde w=t=houte till he was sent for in by the Earle. where
the E. told him, he wold go backe to his house, for there was a
blacke bagg that shold tell noe tayles. wherevppon M=r=
Attorneye tooke occasion to speake: That yf that black bagge could
have bene lighte vppon, there wold haue bene found much good
stuffe.</nonSpeech><dialogue> ffor </dialogue><nonSpeech> (q=th= he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bothe S=r= John Davies and S=r=      
Charles Davers
doe depose that yo=u= said vnto them that black bagg could tell
that yo=u= were betrayed in London. W=ch= allso is witnessed by
<pagebreak id="22" />
Bussell, who was very forward w=th= yo=u=. But yo=u= were confident
in London, havinge beene p'swaded by yo=r= sicophantes that all
the Cittie was of yo=r= p'te and in yo=r= pride and overweeninge of
theire p'takinge, yow contemned the Q=ne's= Royall authoritye, her
herraldes wold not be harkened vnto. </dialogue><nonSpeech>To this the E. of Essex
replyed, as for Bussell, he was never inward w=th= him. he was

doubte not but to manifest, by goinge w=th= a courage and
cherefully vnto my death, that I dye a good Christian, and never
soughte to exceede the degree of a subiecte: howsoever I have
bene delte w=t=hall. I euere soughte to appease all humo=r= of
revenge, and for confirmacon thereof was resolved to receave the
Sacram=t= till the attempt vppon the E. of South. I am far from
Atheisme, and doe desire to dye as a Christian and an Earle,
that haue faithfullie s'ved my Prince and Countrye, whatsoever
others have testified, out of the weaknes of theire hartes against
me, or to seeme to haue said enoughe I desire it may not lye
