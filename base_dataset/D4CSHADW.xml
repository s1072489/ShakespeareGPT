</dialogue> <head>ACT. III.</head> 

<nonSpeech>Enter Sir <font>Edward Hartfort, Belfort</font> and <font>Doubty</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have extreamly delighted us this morning, by 
your House, Gardens, 
your Accomodation, and your way of Living; you put me in mind
of the renowned <font>Sidneys</font> Admirable description of <font>Kalandar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir you Complement me too much.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks you represent to us the Golden 'days of  
Queen <font>Elizabeth</font> , such sure 
were our Gentry then; now they are grown Servile Apes to Forreign    
customes, they
leave off Hospitality, for which we were famous all over             
<font>Europe</font> , and turn Servants
to Board-wages.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my part, I love to have my Servants part of 
my Family, the other
were to hire day Labourers to wait on me; I had rather my Friends,   
Kindred, 
Tennants and Servants should live well out of me, than Coach-makers, 
Taylors, 
Embroiderers, and Lacemen should: To be pointed at in the Streets,   
and have Fools stare 
at my Equipage, is a vanity I have always scorn'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speak like one descended from those Noble    
Ancestors that made <font>France</font> 
tremble, and all the rest of <font>Europe</font> Honour 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I reverence the Memory of 'em: But our          
New-fashion'd Gentry love the 
<font>French</font> too well to fight against 'em; they are bred abroad       
without knowing any thing 
of our Constitution, and come home tainted with Foppery, slavish     
Principles, and 
Popish Religion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They bring home Arts of Building from hot         
Countries to serve for our cold
one; and Frugality from those places where they have little Meat and 
small Stomacks, 
to suffice us who have great plenty and lusty Appetites.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They build Houses with Halls in 'em, not so big as
former Porches; 
Beggers were better entertained by their Ancestors, than their       
Tennants by them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my part, I think 'twas never good days, but 
when great Tables were 
kept in large Halls; the Buttery-hatch always open, Black Jacks, and 
a good smell 
of Meat and March-beer, with Dogs-turds and Mary-bones as Ornaments  
in the 
Hall: These were signs of good House keeping, I hate to see          
<font>Italian</font> fine Buildings 
with no Meat or Drink in 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like not their little Plates, methinks there's  
Vertue in an English Sur-loyn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our Sparks bring nothing but Forreign Vices and  
Follies home; 'tis 
rediculous to be bred in one Country to learn to live in another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> While we lived thus (to borrow a Coxcombly      
word) we made a better 
Figure in the World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have a mind that suits your Fortune, and can  
make your own 
happiness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The greatest is the Enjoyment of my Friends,    
and such Worthy Gentlemen 
<pagebreak id="30" />
as your Selves, and when I cannot have enough of that; I have a      
Library, good 
Horses and good Musick.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Princes may envy such an English Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are too kind, <font>I am a true English-man, I  
love the Princes Rights and 
Peoples Liberties, and will defend 'em both with the last penny in   
my purse, and the last drop 
in my veins, and dare defy the witless Plots of Papists</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Spoken like a Noble Patriot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pardon me, you talk like English-men, and you   
have warm'd me; I hope 
to see the Prince and People flourish yet; old as I am, in spite of  
Jesuits, I am sure our 
Constitution is the Noblest in the World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would there were enough such English Gentlemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twere to be wisht; but our Gentry are so much    
poysoned with Forreign 
Vanities, that methinks the Genius of <font>England</font> seems sunk into    
the Yeomanry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have indeed too many rotten Members. You     
speak like Gentlemen, 
Worthy of such Noble Fathers, as you both had; but Gentlemen I spoke 
of Musick, 
I see two of my Artists, come into the Garden, they shall entertain  
you with a Song 
this Morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir You oblige us every way.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An Italian Song.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Finely compos'd, and excellently perform'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see Sir you are well serv'd in every thing.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter <font>Isabella</font> and <font>Theodosia</font> .</nonSpeech> 

   <nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My sweet Cousin good Morrow to thee, I hope to  
call thee shortly by 
another Name, my dear Child, Heaven's bless thee.                    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab. Kneels.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ladies your most humble Servant; you are early up 
to take the pleasure of 
the Morning in these Gardens.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a Paradice you are in; every object within  
this place is ravishing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Theo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This place affords variety of Pleasures; nothing  
here is wanting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where such fine Ladies are.
 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Servant with</font> Teague O Devilly <font>an Irish-Priest</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Serv.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Gentleman, To speak with you.

Statues, Grottoes 
and the Water-works, I'le <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: I le</comment> wait on you

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is an opportunity beyond our hopes.          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex. Bell. Doubt. Isab. Theo.</font> </nonSpeech>

Neighbours.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had best let this Fool stay to laugh at him,  
he may be out of the damn'd 
Plot, if any Priest was? Sure they would never trust this Fool.      
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>

<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS PAGE NUMBERED 22</comment>
he begs your excuse, and will wait on you presently.                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex. Serv.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heaven gives us yet a longer Opportunity, and     
certainly intends we should 
make use of it; I have my own Parson that comes to hunt with me at   
<font>Whally</font> , Madam, 
an excellent School Divine, that will end all differences betwixt us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is like to begin 'em betwixt us, the Name of a 
Parson is a dreadful Name 
upon these occasions, he'l <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: he l</comment> bring us into a     
Condition we can never get out of, but by 
Death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the absolute command of me and my Fortune can  
please you, you shall never 
desire to get out of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should at more distance and with more          
reverence approach you, Madam, 
did not the shortness of the time, and the great danger of losing    
you, force me to 
be free; Throw not away this pretious time, a Minute now is          
Inestimable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Theo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet I must consider on that Minute on which the   
happiness or Misery of all 
my Life may depend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can I imagine that you who have rambled up    
and down the Southern 
World, should at last fix on a Home-bred Mistress in the North? how  
can you be in 
earnest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Consult your Understanding and your               
Looking-Glass, one will tell you how 
Witty, Wise, and Good you are, the other, how Beautiful, how Sweet,  
how 
Charming.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Men before they are Married turn the great end of 
their Perspective; but the 
little end after it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are Men of ill Eyes, and worse               
Understanding; but for your Perfections 
there needs no Perspective.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Theo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I were inclin'd to Marriage, methinks we are   
not well enough acquainted 
yet to think of that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To my Reputation I suppose you are no Stranger,  
nor to my Estate, which 
lies all in the next County; and for my Love, I will convince you of 
it, by setling what 
ever you please, or all that Estate upon you before I expect any     
Favour from you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Theo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are so Generous beyond my Deserts, that I     
know not how to Credit 
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Modesty is too great, and your Faith too    
little.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Sir</font> Tymothy.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Death, Who are these whith my Mistress and my   
Sister? Oh! they are the 
silly Fellows that we saw at the Spaw, that came hither last night,  
do you know Sir, 
that this is my Mistress Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know Sir that no man is worthy of that Honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, I will make you know that I am Sir,    
and She has the Honour to be 
my Mistress.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well Sir, No 'tis very ill Sir, that you   
should have the boldness to 
take my Mistress by the Hand Sir, and if you do Sir, I must tell you 
Sir -- What do 
you Smile Sir?
<pagebreak id="33" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A man may do what he will with his own Face. I    
may Smile Sir --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you do Sir, I will fight Sir, I tell you     
that Sir. hah,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Timothy</font> , you are a Bloody-minded man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis for my Honour, my Honour, he is plaguely   
afraid; look you Sir, if 
you Smile Sir, at me Sir, I will Kick Sir, that's                    
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: that s</comment> more Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you do, you will be the fifteenth man I have   
run through the Body Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hah! What does he say, through the Body, oh.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Theo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yonders my Brother, we must not be so             
perticular, let's <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: let s</comment> joyn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, the Body Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, and my custom is (if it be a great       
affront, I kill them, for) I rip out 
their Hearts, dry 'em to Powder, and make Snuff on 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Lord! Snuff!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have a box full in my pocket Sir, will you      
please to take some.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, I thank you Sir: Snuff quoth a, I will  
have nothing to do with 
such a cruel man, I say no more Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Servant Sir -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Servant Sir: does he take such Snuff too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same -- do you hear Sir, if you value your    
own life, which I will save 
for the Families sakes, not a word of this to any man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, Not I Sir? Your humble servant.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter Sir <font>Edward</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask your pardon Gentlemen, I was stay'd by    
what, if you please to 
walk in, will divert you well enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wee will wait on you Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Daughter, Sir <font>Jeffery</font> and my <font>Lady</font> have  
made complaints of you for
abusing Sir <font>Timothy</font> ; let me hear no more on't, we have resolv'd 
the Marriage shall 
be to Morrow, it will become you to be upon a little better Tearms   
to day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you here that Gentlewoman --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, I have sent to <font>Whally</font> for all    
your Servants, and Horses, and 
Doggs, you Must do me the honour to Make some stay with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We cannot enough acknowledg your great Civility.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Edw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Complements, I obliege my self, Sir          
<font>Jeffery Shacklehead</font> and I have 
just now agreed, that to morrow shall be the Day of Marriage between

   <nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear Cousin, prethee be kinder to me, I protest 
and vow, as I am a 
Christian, I love the better then both my Eyes, for all this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why how now Dogs face, hast thou the Impudence to 
make love again, 
<pagebreak id="34" />
with that hideous Countenance? that very insipid silly <font>Physnomy</font>  
of thine? with that 
most piteous mein? why, thou lookst like an <font>Operator</font> for Teeth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is all sham, I wont beleive it; I can see  
my self in the great glass, 
and to my mind no man looks more like a Gentleman than my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Gentleman! with that silly wadling shuffling    
gate? thou hast not mien good 
enough for a chief Constable, every change of thy Countenance, and   
every motion 
of thy Body proclaims thee an Ass.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Ay, come Madam, I shall please you better   
when I am Marry'd, with 
a trick that I have; I tell yee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out of my sight, thou makest me sick to see thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall be more Familiar with you to            
Morrow-night, oh my dear rogue -- 
well I say no more, faith I shall, well, no more to be said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be gone thou Basilisk, here, I vow if thou wert   
the only man on Earth, the 
Kinde should cease rather than I would Marry thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'l be in a better humour to Morrow-night,    
though you are such a 
vixen now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This place, where some Materials are to mend the

   <nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must Compose my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir your most humble Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Ladiships most humble Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is not fit I should lose this opportunity,   
to tell you that (which 
perhaps may not be unacceptable to a person of our Complexion) who   
is so much a 
Gentleman, that I'le swear I have not seen your equal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear Madam, you confound me with your Praises.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I vow 'tis true; indeed I have strugled with my 
self before I thought fit 
to reveal this: but the consideration of your great accomplishments, 
do indeed, as 
it were, ravish, or extort it from me, as I may so say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech you Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is Friend of mine, a Lady (whom the world 
has acknowledged 
to be well bread, and of Parts too, that I must say, and almost      
confess) not in the 
Bud indeed, but in the Flower of her Age, whom time has not yet      
invaded with 
his injuries; in fine, envy cannot say that she is less than a full  
ripe Beauty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That this Creature should bring forth such a     
Daughter. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fair of Complexion, Tall, Streight, and shaped  
much above the ordinary; 
in short, this Lady (whom many have Languished, and Sigh'd in vain   
for) does of 
her self, so much admire your Person, and your Parts, that she       
extreamly desires to 
contract a Friendship with you, intire to all intents and purposes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis impossible she should be in earnest, Madam, 
but were she, I cannot 
Marry ever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why she is Married already, Lord how dull he    
is! she is the best Friend I 
have, Married to an old man, far above her sprightly years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a Mother-in-Law am I like to have!          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you not Guess who this is all this while?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Too well. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To himself.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Not I truly Madam. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To her.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha: No! that's strange, ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot possibly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha, I'le swear! ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I'le <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: I le</comment> swear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis very much, you are an ill guesser, I'le    
vow, ha, ha, ha! Oh Lord! not 
yet?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Doubt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not yet, nor ever can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>La. <font>Sha.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's Company, retire.
     
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter <font>Smerk</font> and <font>Tegue O Divelly</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Smerk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am all on fire, what is it that Inspires me!   
I thought her ugly once, but 
this morning thought her ugly: And thus to burn in love already!     
Sure I was blind, 
she is a beauty greater than my fancy e're could form; a minutes     
absence is death to 
me.
