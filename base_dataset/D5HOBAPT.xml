DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN A 
NEW BAPTIST 
AND A 
CHURCH-MAN.
PART. I.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bapt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Friend, what think
you now of our Preachers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They seem to have a
deal of Fervour, and what 
you call Zeal; and I hope
are honest Men and mean
well; but truly I think 'em
a little touch'd in their Heads, and are going
into a Distemper call'd by Physicians <font>Religious
Madness</font> .
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sorry, Friend, you shou'd take in such an
Opinion of them; for I judge them to be not
only good Men, but to be endowed with a large 
Measure of the <font>Spirit of God</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Spirit of God is a Wise, Calm,
reasonable Spirit; and the Author of none but wise and
reasonable Discourses, Gestures and Actions. I
hope you will not charge their Grimaces,
Gesticulations, bodily Heats, weak and rash Speeches
and strange Doctrines on the Spirit of God;
nor any thing that is false and absurd,
Uncharitable or Ridiculous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I acknowledge the Spirit which is <font>from
above</font> is wise, gentle, meek and mild, charitable
and kind; yet we read of very odd Things the
Prophets of God did when filled by his Spirit,
and animated by holy Zeal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Jewish</font> Prophets did in an Age and
Country when and where it was customary to
teach Men by Types, Figures and Signs is not to
be drawn into Imitation by Christians.
   Nor do we find that the Apostles and first
Preachers, sent out by Christ, practised any such Things.
And the Discourses of the Prophets and of Christ
and his Apostles are wise, calm, charitable, just
and strong. Nor can I think their Behaviour was
any way odd, scenical and antick, such as becomes
a Stage rather than the Pulpit.
<pagebreak id="5" />
   Besides, your Preachers give not the least Proof
that they have more of the Spirit of God than
other Men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You know that by the Foolishness of
Preaching God saveth Souls, and chooseth weak Things
to confound the Mighty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is a wide difference between <font>foolish
Preaching</font> , and the <font>Foolishness of Preaching</font> . The
Gentile Philosophers and Wise Men called all
Preaching of the heavenly Doctrines of a
crucified Saviour <font>Foolishness</font> , even the rational and
noble Sermons of <font>Peter, Stephen</font> and <font>Paul</font> . But
was <font>Paul</font> to rise from the Dead and hear at what
a rate your Ministers murdered and mangled the
Gospel of his Master, he wou'd call it <font>foolish
Preaching</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If God convert Souls by it, this will justify
it against all your Satyr.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May not a Friend say, if God convert Souls
by <font>Humms</font> and <font>Hawings</font> , by broad Hats and
Coats cut to the Quick, and by silent Meetings,
will not this justify them?
   Conversion is the change of Men's Hearts and
Lives, and their Living according to the Gospel;
which is quite another Thing, and far better than
raising the Passions, striking the Imaginations of
weak Women and Enthusiastick Men.
<pagebreak id="6" />
Besides, what Aptitude have bodily Motions,
wry Faces, distorted Limbs, and tuneful
Nonsense to convert Souls?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you wou'd not have our Preachers
to stand stock still in the Pulpit, and deliver their
Sermons like so many speaking Posts. I love to
see and hear a Man talk with Life and Concern,
as if he was in Earnest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not like <font>wooden Preachers</font> any better
than you. But great is the Difference between
the silly Motions and Gestures, Screwings and
Tones of your Preachers; and that Action and
Gesture which carrieth Dignity in it, and which
becometh the Awfulness of the Gospel Doctrine,
and the Gravity of the Pulpit.
   Tho' I approve of neither, yet I had rather
see a <font>Statue</font> in the Pulpit than a <font>Jack-pudding</font> or
a <font>Merry-Andrew</font> : As I had rather see People
<font>asleep</font> under a dull Sermon, than <font>laughing</font> at the
ridiculous Behaviour of the Preacher.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You represent our Preachers as a parcel of
Fools, I think very unjustly; and that you
mistake the Fruits of the Spirit of God, for the Effects
of Folly and Enthusiasm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Preachers may have common Sense
upon other Subjects and in other Places, but they
seem to leave it all behind them when they get
into the Pulpit, and begin to talk Divinity. And
if I am mistaken in 'em, I cannot help it. My
Reason and the Gospel tell me, That the Fruits
of the Spirit are Wisdom, Prudence, Meekness,
Goodness, strong Arguments, warm Perswasions,
Sincerity of Heart and Beneficence of Life; such
as we find in the Life and Sermons of St. <font>Paul</font> ,
<pagebreak id="7" />
and of his Master <font>Jesus Christ</font> . --- Not bodily
Passions and Postures, wild and furious Zeal,
Uncharitable Censures, damnatory Sentences, and
Unscriptural Doctrines.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You run on to great Lengths; if some of
our Preachers are not quite so prudent and modest
as we cou'd wish 'em; I am sure they are very
<font>sound</font> Preachers, and <font>orthodox</font> Divines, and on this
Score we value 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>your</font> Sense every Man is sound and
<font>orthodox</font> who preaches up the <font>Calvinistick Scheme</font>
delivered in the <font>Assemblies Confession</font> and <font>Catechisms</font> ;
or who perhaps publish the gross Errors of Dr.
<font>Crisp</font> , and other <font>Antinomian</font> Writers.
   But in the Judgment of <font>God</font> every Man is sound
and orthodox, who is <font>upright, sincere</font> and <font>good</font> ;
that is, who seeks the Truth with all his Heart,
and lives agreeably to the Gospel. That one Text
proves it. <font>A Good Understanding have all
they who do his Commandments.</font> Psal.cxi.10.
   This notion of Orthodoxy is supported by the
whole Body of the <font>Scriptures</font> , which every where
pronounces <font>upright</font> and <font>obedient</font> Christians blessed.
It is also consonant to the dictates of <font>Reason</font> , that
a wise and good God shou'd not require of any
Man more than <font>hearty desires</font> to find out the
Truth, and <font>earnest Endeavours</font> in practising it.
The plain Language of Scripture and Reason is,
that every <font>good Man</font> is a sound Man, and every
<font>upright Preacher</font> Orthodox.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I mean, that our Ministers preach
sound Doctrine, and are themselves sound in
the Faith.
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So does every faithful Preacher, preach
sound Doctrine; and every upright Christian is
sound in the Faith. Upright and honest Men,
unless under the strong Prejudices of a false
Education, cannot mistake the great Doctrines and
Laws of Jesus Christ; if, instead of searching the
Books of Men, they look for them in God's own
Book.
   But as you are wonderful Dealers in these two
Words <font>Sound</font> and <font>Orthodox</font> , let us briefly
consider in what Sense St. <font>Paul</font> uses the word <font>Sound</font> .
   By <font>sound Doctrine 1 Tim. i. 10.</font> I apprehend St.
<font>Paul</font> means Doctrine that condemns Whoring
and Lewdness, Lying and Stealing, Malice and
Murder, that is, the great <font>Laws</font> of Religion and
Morality. Now what Ministers best preach this
sort of <font>sound Doctrine</font> , I leave you to Judge.
   A <font>sound Mind 2 Tim. i. 7.</font> is a Mind steddy to
Christ and Christianity; or a being <font>sound in God's
Statutes</font> . Psal cxix. 8.
   The <font>form of sound Words</font> mention'd <font>2 Tim. i.
13.</font> surely does not mean the <font>Assemblies Catechism</font> .
nor any <font>Church Articles</font> , nor any Words which
Man's Wisdom (or Folly) have taught; but
Words which the Holy Ghost hath taught, Words
of Scripture.
   Men who will not indure <font>sound Doctrine 2 Tim.
iv. 3.</font> are Men who love not to hear, and will not
be governed by the Laws of Jesus Christ; Men
who (with all their Faith) walk after their own
Lusts; who have itching Ears, and run from
Preacher to Preacher, being fond of every new Doctrine.
These are the People who can't indure sound
Doctrine; and you know who they are.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   <font>Sound Doctrines</font> in <font>Tit. i. 9.</font> are Gospel motives
and strong Arguments, fit for Exhortation and
Conviction.
   <font>Sound in the Faith</font> , v. 13. Men's living up to
their Knowledge, Faith and Profession; not
attending to Fables, and human Doctrines;
owning God <font>in Works</font> , as well as with the Mouth.
ver. 16.
   <font>Sound Doctrine, Tit. ii. 1.</font> is preaching and
giving Rules of Practise, of Virtue and Morality
to both Sexes, to the Aged and the Young
suitable to their State.
   <font>Sound in the Faith, v. 2.</font> means to be faithful;
as <font>sound in Charity</font> means to be sincerely
Charitable.
   <font>Sound Speech, v. 9.</font> is just and rational Speech,
which cannot be confuted and condemned;
<font>uncorrupted</font> by human Doctrines; <font>gravely</font>
delivered, not comically; from a <font>sincere Heart</font> , not an
inflamed Head.
   Thus I have gone thro' all the Texts in the
<font>New Testament</font> which speak of <font>sound Doctrine,
Speech and Faith</font> ; and leave you to judge
whether your new tantivy Preachers, who come
riding in from all Parts of the Country, are the
<font>sound Men</font> you boast them to be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I own the Contexts of these several Texts
seem to countenance your Exposition of them.
Therefore to let the Words <font>Sound</font> and <font>Orthodox</font>
lye by; I think our Ministers teach very <font>true</font>
Doctrine, and that there was great need of 'em
in Town to put a stop to those Errors which
begin to spread so fast.
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am willing, Neighbour, as far as my 
Ability goes, to try the Matter with you, on
which side the Truth lies. To this end let me
know what are those peculiar Doctrines your
Teachers come here in such Numbers to support,
or what Errors do they come to oppose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One of the principal Doctrines they come
to maintain is the Doctrine of the ever blessed
<font>Trinity</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If by the Doctrine of the <font>Trinity</font> you mean
the Doctrine of <font>Father, Son</font> and <font>Holy Spirit</font> ;
they might have stay'd at home; in regard, as
far as I know the Town, this Doctrine is
firmly believ'd by every Preacher in Town, and by
all their Hearers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I chiefly mean the <font>Divinity of Jesus Christ</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know no Christian, much less any
Christian Preacher who denieth it. Is it therefore
well done in you and your Preachers to spread
such false Reports of your Fellow-Christians? I
hope you think <font>Lying</font> a great Sin; and <font>accusing
the Brethren falsely</font> a Work of the Devil. Can
you therefore justify your Teachers in such a
Charge, before they know it to be true and are
able to prove it; and which perhaps they know
to be false?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot justify Lying and Falsehood,
Calumny and Clamour in any Cause. I am
sensible the Cause of Christ and Truth do not
need them. But they mean that some Preachers
and People in Town deny the <font>supreme Deity</font> of
Jesus Christ, and his Equality with the Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not this a very wicked way of
proceeding, to charge Men with denying the Divinity
<pagebreak id="11" />
of Jesus Christ, who only deny his <font>supreme Deity</font>
and <font>Equality</font> with the Father.
   For my Part, I hold Jesus Christ to be God,
or a God, because the Father hath given him
divine Perfections, and universal Dominion, or
Headship, Authority to judge, and has
commanded all Men to worship him.
   But I can't bring my self to believe his <font>supreme
Deity</font> , because I believe in the same supreme
Deity of God the Father; and it appears to me
a plain contradiction to say there are two
Persons or Beings who are both of 'em <font>supreme</font> or
<font>most High God</font> ; and I never yet had Faith eno'
to believe two contradictory Propositions.
   As my Reason, my Understanding, the Candle
of the Lord within me, telleth me there can be
but one <font>supreme</font> or <font>most High God</font> : So I think
the whole Scriptures lead me to think that this
<font>supreme, most High God</font> is the <font>God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ</font> ; and not the Son of God
the Father.
   Before the Lord Jesus Christ became Man, or
had a Body prepared for him, he came from the
Father, was sent by Him, and imployed by him;
But can the <font>supreme God</font> be sent or commissioned
by another? Shou'd we not abhor so absurd and
blasphemous a Thought? Therefore it is
impossible that Jesus Christ shou'd be the <font>supreme God</font> ;
and wou'd you have me believe Impossibilities?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But does not St. <font>Paul</font> affirm that Christ
thought <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: throught</comment> it <font>no Robbery to be equal with   
God</font> .
Phil. ii. 6.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Translation is, I think, given up by
most learned Men; because it corresponds not to
<pagebreak id="12" />
the Original Greek. However I think it must be
wrong.
   1. Because it no way suiteth the <font>Context</font> , which
speaks of the same Person as <font>in the Form</font> , Image
or Likeness of God, as <font>obedient</font> to God, and 
<font>exalted</font> by him.
   2. Because it is contradictory to the Reason
God has given us as our highest Guide, to
conceive that the Son, who was begotten by the
Father, who <font>came from</font> him, who hath his Life,
Power, Dominion, Glory as a Gift and Reward
from the Father, should be <font>equal</font> to <font>God the
Father</font> , who came from none, nor can receive any
Thing, which he had not originally and
underived in himself. This appears to me another
Contradiction to make a derived and an
underived being equal.
   3. Because it is a Sense contrary to all those
plain Texts which speak of Christ as the express
<font>Image</font> of the Father as <font>commissioned</font> by him; as
<font>doing</font> his Will, as seeking his Glory, as praying
to him to be taken back into his original Glory,
as appointed by God universal Head and Judge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But does not Christ himself say, <font>I and the
Father are one</font> , John x. 30.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Christ says, <font>I</font> (as one Person); <font>and my
Father</font> (as another Person) wou'd you have him
contradict himself in the same Breath, by saying
we two Persons are <font>one Person, one Being, one
God</font> . And this too, after he had just affirm'd
that all his Miracles he wrote <font>in his Father's
Name</font> , and that his <font>Father was greater than all</font> .
'Tis an easy, natural and just Sense, that <font>He</font> and the
<font>Father</font> were one, as he did the Father's Will,
<pagebreak id="13" />
and acted by Commission from him, and
pursued the same End and Design; this suits the
whole Context. Why then shou'd we attempt
to force upon the Words a sense unnatural,
unintelligible and contradictory, that is to make
Nonsense of it. When Christ says, <font>John xvii. 21.
That they may be one, as thou Father art in me,
and I, in thee, that they</font> also <font>may be one in us</font> ;
You'll not <font>deify</font> all Believers or Apostles upon
such a Text.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But our Ancient Divine have always taken
it for a <font>Unity of Essence</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some ancient Divines, I am told, have
taken it otherwise. And as to <font>Essence</font> it is a Word
I scarce well understand, but as far I do
understand it I can't think that a begotten and an
unbegotten Essence are the same. And the Sense
I have given appears to me so just, that we need
not seek any other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tho' there may be some Difficulties in this
Matter not easily got over; yet I think we
cannot speak too honourably of the Son of God; nor
can I bear to hear any thing lessening said of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you not, at least ought you not to be
as Zealous for the Glory of <font>God the Father</font> , who
so loved the World as to send his <font>only begotten
Son</font> to save it? Is not God the Father greatly
dishonoured by setting up a Rival with him in
supreme Empire? Can any thing be more 
affronting and dishonourable to the Son of God, than to
suppose that he is this Rival, who declares he
always sought the Father's Honour? Can any
Conduct more displease him than to <font>belye him</font> as the
<font>Jews</font> did, by saying He made himself <font>equal</font> with
<pagebreak id="14" />
God, because he said he was the <font>Son of God</font> ? Are
not the Scriptures the Measure of the Honours to
be paid to the Son of God? Shou'd not we
follow his Example, and make his Father's Honour
our chief End? For my Part I never heard any
of our Divines speak a dishonouring Word of the
Son of God; and it is a very bad Office in your
little nibling Teachers to accuse them of it. If
Jesus Christ be honoured as the only begotten
Son of God, as a Teacher sent from God, as the
promised Messiah and Saviour, as the only
appointed Mediator and Intercessor, as universal
Lord and as final Judge: Is not this all the
Honour the Scriptures claim for him? Did he ever
challenge more? Does a string of great swelling
Words, hard and unintelligible Names,
<font>Co-essential, Con-substantial, Co-eternal</font> , do him any
Honour? Or, is not the doing his Will, and keeping his
Commands the truest Honour? Will he own any
others as his Friends, but such as do whatsoever
he commands them? Will crying, <font>Lord, Lord</font> ,
or any pretended Honours paid him with the
Lips be accepted while He is denied in Works?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These you mention as only chiming Words,
are great and <font>Mysterious</font> Points, above our
Comprehension; yet we ought to believe them, tho'
we do not understand them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All your Contradictions and Jargon you
cover with the sacred Name of <font>Mysteries</font> ; they are
indeed Incomprehensible, just as
<font>Transubstantiation</font> is, nothing in them is comprehensible but the
Absurdity of them. If I cou'd comprehend any
Truth in them, I  shou'd readily believe it; but
to tell me I must believe what I do not
<pagebreak id="15" />
understand, is to tell me I must believe <font>I know not
what</font> . This blind Belief you are taught. But
Jesus Christ acted in another Manner; and has not
required us to believe any Doctrine, but what he
first clearly revealed and explained. If any
Doctrine was a Mystery before, his Revealing it has
made it no longer a Mystery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope I can convince you that you are wrong
here by one plain Instance. You believe the
Doctrine of the <font>Resurrection</font> , yet I hope you do not
pretend to understand it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe no more about it than I do
understand; I believe the Dead shall rise and live, and
I very well understand what Rising from the Dead
and Living again means, as well as I do what
Rising from Sleep, and Living again means. But 
as to the <font>Mode</font> or Manner of the Resurrection,
nothing about it being, revealed, I have no
Ideas about it; and therefore can believe nothing
about what I understand nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Doctrine of the <font>Con-substantiality,
Co-equality</font> , &amp;c. of the Son of God is a Doctrine
indeed <font>above our Reason</font> , but not <font>contrary to
Reason</font> ; therefore if revealed, ought to be received.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it be <font>above our Reason</font> , we have nothing
to do with it as I have shewed, and can believe
nothing about it: If it <font>be revealed</font> , it is
revealed <font>to our Reason</font> , and may be understood and
believed; otherwise it is not revealed. And, I
think, I have proved that this Doctrine, as your
Teachers represent it, is <font>not revealed</font> by Jesus
Christ and his Apostles; and that it <font>cannot be
revealed</font> from the God of Truth, being not only
above, but <font>contrary</font> to our Ideas of God, and to
all the Dictates of Reason.
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> However I cannot think it safe to go off the
antient Protestant Doctrine in this Article of our
Faith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor can I think it safe to go off the much
more ancient Gospel Doctrine; nor to be
governed by blind, implicit Faith in any of our
Teachers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you set up your Judgment against your
Teachers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All the Protestants did so, when they left
the Church <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Chrch</comment> of <font>Rome</font> ; you Dissenters do    
so, in
leaving our Church. The <font>Jews</font> did so in following
<font>Peter</font> and <font>Paul</font> and <font>Jesus Christ</font> . Our best
Protestant Divines teach us to do so, when ever our
Teachers depart from God's Word and teach for
Doctrines of God the Words of Men.
   Now when any Preachers preach the
<font>Co-equality, Co-essentiality, Supremacy</font> of the Son of God,
according to my Understanding they preach the
Doctrines of Men instead of the Truths of God.
Ought I not then to follow my own private 
Judgment, or to believe and act according to my own
Understanding and Conscience after I have
obtained all the Light and Help I can? Do not
you act thus, and every honest Man? If I have
God's Word on my side, is not that enough?
But besides I have our most learned Divines, and
those I count the best Preachers on my side also;
and I do not intend to forsake them to follow a
Parcel of bold Fellows, who might do well
enough at their <font>Looms</font> , but make sad work of
it in the <font>Pulpit</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll reply to all your Reasoning only this,
That <font>the natural Man receiveth not the things of</font>
<pagebreak id="17" />
<font>the Spirit of God; They are Foolishness unto him;
neither can he know them, for they are
spiritually discerned</font> . 1 Cor. ii. 14.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a Text which every Enthusiast and
Impudent Prater maketh the last Refuge. You
do not consider Neighbour, what a spirit of Pride
and Presumption it discovers to suppose all who
differ from you <font>natural and carnal Men</font> ; and all
on your own side <font>Spiritual Men</font> . Have not we
the same <font>Revelation</font> of the Spirit to be our Guide
that you have; and where has God promised
your Teachers more <font>Assistance</font> from the Spirit
than other Men who seek it as earnestly as they.
But your Teachers are as remarkable for <font>Modesty</font>
in the Pulpit as for the <font>good Sense</font> they deliver
there. But enough of this.
   Pray what other Fundamental Doctrines do
these new Preachers come now to Propagate?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That great and most comfortable Doctrine
of God's electing from all eternity a certain 
Number out of the fallen Race of Mankind, to
everlasting Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did not God, from all Eternity, foresee
<font>the whole human Race</font> in a fallen and helpless
Condition?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And did he decree Help only for a very few
of these?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, only for a few.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are not the Rest for whom he ordained no
Help equally his Off-spring, his Creatures and
Children?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, He is the Maker of All.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where then is his <font>Pity</font> , his <font>Grace</font> , the
<pagebreak id="18" />
sounding of his Bowels over those Millions of undone
Creatures, whom he resolved not to help?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Grace of God is <font>free</font> , and He may do
what he will with his own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If God's Grace be <font>free</font> , upon your
Principles it is very <font>little</font> . What can we think of a
Father, who seeth all his Children in Misery, and
who has Ability enough to help them all, and
yet resolves to send Help to a very few only. Will
that Rule bring him off, &quot;that he may do what
He will with his own?&quot; Instead of a merciful,
good and tender hearted Father, will not the
World Judge him a hard hearted Wretch; who
saw the Ship split in Pieces, and all his Children
like to be drown'd; and while he had Boats
enough to save them all, yet sent them out only
to save two or three out of a hundred perishing
Children. You talk a deal of <font>Grace</font> and <font>free
Grace</font> , but when your dark Scheme is examined,
and your hideous Doctrine opened, there
appears little Grace and Charity in it; God is
robbed by it of his chief Glory.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But God's Grace is free to the Elect.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These you say are very few; none of the
<font>Heathens</font> ; perhaps none of the <font>Papists</font> ; amongst
the <font>Protestants</font> none but such as hold your
Fundamentals; so that the <font>Elect</font> will be reduc'd to
a few <font>whimsical Baptists</font> . As if <font>Heaven</font> was a
Region of Enthusiasm, Error, Bigotry, and
Uncharitableness; and the Elect a parcel of proud,
self-conceited Separatists.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You grow warm, Friend, and carry your
Reflection too far.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Warmth can ever be justified, it may in
such a Cause as this.
   To see and hear Doctrines published and
defended which obscure the richest Grace of God,
and represent him as the <font>most cruel Being</font> in the
Universe; who, when He cou'd easily and
honourably Help the infinite Race of his fallen Off-spring,
decreed Help only for a very few, and that
without <font>any Reason</font> at all on his Children's Part, those
being previously <font>no better</font> than the Rest who are
left to perish under his unpitying Eye.
   Will it not excuse a little Warmth, to hear the
good and blessed God represented not only as the
most <font>cruel</font> and <font>unmerciful</font> , but as the most
<font>deceitful and insincere Being</font> ; who tho' he has <font>decreed</font>
no saving Help for the greatest Part of his lost
Children, yet pretends <font>to offer</font> them Help; and
also a most <font>unrighteous Being</font> who threatens a
severer Damnation if they accept not his offers,
which he knows they cannot accept? Is not this
a <font>mocking</font> his Creatures already Helpless, and an
<font>insulting</font> over their Miseries; in stead of
shewing them any Mercy?
   Will any wise, just and good Father act at this
rate? And shall we ascribe all this Folly, 
partiality and unkind Dealing to God?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must not measure God by Man; nor the
Ways of God by the Ways of Men, his thoughts
and ways are far above ours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are <font>far above</font> ours in Mercy,
Goodness, Grace, Wisdom and Justice, not <font>far below</font>
ours. If we must judge at all of God's Wisdom,
Justice and Charity, we must judge of 'em <font>by
his Actions</font> and <font>Works</font> , as we do of Men's by
<pagebreak id="20" />
theirs. Does not God call Men to judge of the
Equity and Kindness of his Ways, and to
compare them with Men's? Must we not judge of
them by the best Ideas of Justice and Kindness
we have? Now can we possibly judge <font>God</font> to 
be Wise, Just and Merciful if <font>his Ways</font> are not
so? And can we possibly <font>love him</font> , while we
conceive of him as no way lovely?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God hath Mercy on whom he will have
Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth; and what
is Man to contend with God; hath not the
<font>Potter</font> power over his own Clay?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray cease abusing and misapplying
Scripture; quote not God's own Word against
Himself, to prove him without any Mercy towards
Millions of his perishing Creatures. God was at
Liberty to shew Mercy to the lost Nations of
the World, when the <font>Jews</font> rejected offered Grace.
He acted, both in calling <font>Gentiles</font> into his
Kingdom, and in rejecting the <font>Jews</font> , according to <font>his
Will</font> ; but he willed both these Events according
to Reason and Justice.
   Nor did God harden <font>Pharaoh's</font> Heart any
other way that we know of, but by kindness to
<font>Israel</font> , and reprieves to Himself; and leaving him
to pursue the wicked Counsels of his Heart. But
you make God <font>more foolish</font> than any <font>Potter</font> , and
more <font>hard-hearted</font> than <font>Pharaoh</font> ; He set
Taskmasters over <font>Israel</font> to torment them and diminish
them for a few Years: But upon your
Principles, God torments his own Creatures and
Children Millions of Years and Ages for what they
<font>cou'd not Help</font> ; and this only to shew what
his Power and Wrath can do, or from pure
<pagebreak id="21" />
illnature; whereas <font>Pharaoh</font> acted from a Principle
of Self-Preservation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But Sinners may help many of their Sins;
and therefore are justly condemn'd for doing what
they shou'd not have done, and for not doing
what they cou'd do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Many of your Preachers say they are decreed
to be damned for being <font>fallen in Adam</font> ; and I
am sure they <font>cou'd not help that</font> . And is not this
a cruel, unwise, and unjust Decree? Can any but
a Devil make such a Decree?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You talk strangely, and run great Lengths;
I hope our Principles are not chargeable at this
Rate?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is plain they are, I go not a tittle farther
than your own Principles carry me. If God has
decreed to damn Millions of Men for being fallen
in <font>Adam</font> , he has made the most unjust Decree
that ever was made, a thousand Times more
unjust than the Decree of <font>Pharaoh</font> to drown all the
Male Children, because they were born of
<font>Israelitish</font> Parents, or were born <font>Males</font> ; neither of
which cou'd the Children help. This is horrid
Doctrine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I own as you represent it, this appears
horrid Doctrine, I cannot think thus of the ever
blessed God, our Preachers do not talk in this way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they hide the horrid Consequences from
you, and cheat you with Contradictions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard them often say, that Men will
be damned for not believing and rejecting Christ;
and for not being converted to God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If God; has decreed to damn Men, for not
believing in a Christ, who never died for them:
<pagebreak id="22" />
If he has decreed to damn Men for not being
converted, when he has decreed not to convert
them: Is not this decreeing to damn them for
not believing Contradictions, or Falshoods; and
for not doing Impossibilities? Is this that God
who is <font>good to all</font> , and whose tender Mercies are
over all his Works? Can a wise, a just, a
merciful God order weak Men to remove Mountains,
and then damn them if they do not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since God offers Salvation to all, Men are
justly condemn'd if they never try to accept it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus you make God the greatest of all Cheats
when he offers to Sinners a Salvation <font>never
purchased</font> for them, and which he has absolutely
decreed never to give them: And when he offers it
<font>upon Conditions</font> they cannot comply with, without
<font>irresistible Grace</font> , and he has decreed never to give
them that Grace: And when he threatens a 
<font>heavier Damnation</font> to them if they do not believe
and obey the Gospel, which he knows they
cannot do. Is this the Divinity of your Preachers!
This is indeed a new Gospel, just as unlike the
kind and merciful Gospel of Jesus Christ; as a
false and merciless Devil is unlike the true and
merciful God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tho' I am not for these Extreams; yet I
can't but think the Doctrine of God's <font>electing
Love</font> a very <font>comfortable</font> Doctrine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must not He be a perfect Visionary, or a
hard-hearted Son, who cou'd take any Comfort
from a Decree of his Father to give him his
whole Estate, while all the rest of his Children
are left to endless Beggary? Can a wife and
good Child take any Comfort from a Thought
<pagebreak id="23" />
which wou'd represent his Father as a partial
Tyrant, relentlessly cruel to the greatest Part of his
Off-spring? Can any wife and good Man
comfort himself in a Doctrine which paints God in so
unlovely and horrid an Image; and which leaves
Millions of God's Creatures in helpless Misery
for ever? Can any Man justly take Comfort in
a Doctrine which makes it <font>a hundred to one</font> that
he is not elected, but must be for ever damn'd?
Doth not the Gospel give better Grounds of
Comfort arising from God's Universal Love to a lost
World, and the general offers of Mercy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But if Sinners will not <font>try</font> and use their best
Endeavours, they will deserve Punishment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why shou'd Men try at Impossibilities?
Will their best Endeavours change God's Decrees?
If Men must stand or fall <font>according to their Works</font> ,
there is Room for Endeavours, and for Perswasions
to use them; but if according to <font>eternal absolute
Decrees</font> , there is room for neither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Men have lost their Ability to repent,
believe and obey, may not God justly punish them
for not using it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If they have wilfully lost it, they may be
punished as far as that Crime deserveth; but then
to require them to do what they have <font>no
Ability</font> to do, is <font>Tyranny</font> ; and to punish them again
for not doing it, is <font>Cruelty</font> ; and to make them
fine offers on Condition they will do, what they
have no Ability to do, is <font>Delusion</font> and <font>Insult</font> . Is
this Gospel? Are these glad Tidings? Is Satan
more unlike an Angel of Light, than these Articles
are to the Gospel of Truth and Love? But pray
<pagebreak id="24" />
when and how did Men lose their Ability to
repent, to believe and obey the Gospel?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They lost it in <font>Adam</font> ; and by and at the
Fall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose the Women lost it in <font>Eve</font> , and the
Men in <font>Adam</font> . And did they indeed lose it near
6000 Years before they had it, or before they
had a Being? I wonder to hear a Man who can
talk good Sense about Trade, Civil Justice,
Affairs of State, talk so point-blank Nonsense in
Divinity. But suppose <font>Adam</font> lost a Power to
repent, believe and obey the Gospel, before he had
it; and lost it from us many Ages before we had
a Being; Is it Just to condemn to Hell Fire
innocent Children for what their great Ancestor did
4 or 6000 Years before they were born? Or can
you think God is at all Angry with <font>us</font> for what
<font>Adam</font> did; if we approve of, and imitate <font>Adam's</font>
Transgression, we may be punish'd for such
Approbation and Imitation; but not for his
Transgression.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tho' I cannot say, that God is Angry with
us for what <font>Adam</font> did, yet the Scripture says,
That <font>by the Disobedience of one, many were made
Sinners</font> ; and that <font>thro' the Offence of one,
Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But must we interpret these Texts against all
Rules of Reason; and against the Unchangeable
Law of God? That Children shall not die for the
Iniquity of the Father. See <font>Ezek.</font> xviii. 20. I own
we suffer loss thro' <font>Adam's</font> Fall; and have an
Hereditary Disease conveyed to us, which worketh
Death; as many Children lose Estates and Health
<pagebreak id="25" />
thro' the Iniquity of their Parents; That St. <font>Paul</font>
by <font>Sinners</font> means <font>Sufferers</font> is plain not only from
Reason, for no other Sense can be true; but from
his own Explication. <font>In Adam all die.</font> But as
Men <font>pity</font> those who are made unhappy thro' the
Fault of others, so does God; He pities the
human Race and in his Love and Pity has sent his
Son to redeem and save them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tho' I shou'd allow that we are not
properly guilty of <font>Adam's</font> Sin; yet may not God impute
it to us, as he was our Representative?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we had been in Being, had been
Principals in the Affair, and <font>Adam</font> had acted by our
Order, his Action might justly be so far imputed
to us. But will a just and good God impute to
you and me what we never did, or possibly cou'd
do; what we knew nothing of, nor possibly cou'd
know; what we never consented to, or approved
of? Will He charge to our Account what we
are as Innocent of as the Child unborn is of his
Father's Crimes and Follies? Shall we thus quit
our Understandings, and give up all the Principles
of Reason, Truth and Justice, in order to
compose an absurd and unrighteous Scheme of
Divinity!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tho' these Things seem so contrary to
human Reason; they are agreeable to the Holy
Scriptures.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A fine Complement upon the Holy
Scriptures, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ; as if it was
the most irrational and absurd Book in the World.
Is this the way to recommend your Notions to Men
of Sense and Reason, to allow that they are
irrational and absurd? Is not this blaspheming the
<pagebreak id="26" />
Holy Bible, to suppose the Doctrines of God,
the great Author of Reason, are contradictory to
Reason? For my Part, I receive the Gospel,
because I believe it to be the most wise, reasonable,
just, sincere and friendly Institution in the World.
If, upon Examination, it appear an Unreasonable
Gospel, I ought to reject it, because such a
Gospel can never come from God. There are many
<font>Jewish Phrases</font> in it which are easily
misunderstood and abused by fanciful Men. But is any
Thing more rational, more agreeable to human
Reason than the Preaching of Christ and his
Apostles?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I own their Discourses are becoming Men
of Sense, and who had the Spirit of God. But
what will you make of those several Texts which
so plainly assert a <font>Predestination</font> and <font>Election</font> in
the Epistles of <font>Paul</font> and <font>Peter</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those Texts have been strangely applied to
God's choosing from Eternity a few particular
Persons to everlasting Life, without any Respect
to their Behaviour, and for no Reason at all;
contrary to the whole Stream and Design of the
Bible, and contrary to all wise Rules of
Government; and in contradiction to a Judgment to come,
when Men will be saved or condemned, not
according to absolute <font>Election</font> , but according to
their <font>Works</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Friend, how will you understand these
Texts, if not in the Sense of our Divines.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As far as my Reading and Judgment go,
and as some, whom I esteem the best Writers and
Preachers teach. Those Texts are to be
understood of God's first Electing and Adopting the
<pagebreak id="27" />
Seed of <font>Abraham</font> ; and then upon their
crucifying the Son of God and rejecting his Gospel,
God's choosing, electing or adopting all the
spiritual Seed of <font>Abraham</font> tho' amongst the <font>Gentiles</font> ,
all virtuous and good Men, all who believ'd the
Gospel; and this agreeable to his ancient Designs,
before he laid the Foundation of the <font>Jewish</font>
Ages.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I own this is a plausible Account, agreeable
enough to the History of the Old and New
Testament; and carrieth in it a grand Scheme of
Providence, and is free of all Absurdities. But it is
not the Sense given by our old Protestant Divines,
Men who had the Spirit of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have as great a Respect for our old
Divines as you; but not a blind Faith in any Man.
They brought a great deal of Light, and did a
great deal of good; but shall we restrain the
Spirit of God to them; or must we make no
Progress in Knowledge? Or if God raise up other
Lights, must we refuse their Help? I doubt not,
if our old Divines were now alive, they wou'd
agree to the Sense I have given.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothwithstanding, I think we ought not too
suddenly to depart from the Principles and Faith,
for which our Father's suffered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They suffered for a Scripture Religion, and
the Rights of Conscience and private Judgment,
and used their own Understandings and Reason,
as we do ours. They suffered, because they cou'd
not <font>believe</font> as their Fathers did; and wou'd not
<font>do</font> , in Matters of Religion and Conscience, as
their superiors required. They did not suffer for
the peculiar Opinions of a Party, but for the
<pagebreak id="28" />
common Rights of Mankind, and the Doctrines
in which all good Christians agree.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To pass over these Points; how will you
defend the hated Doctrine of <font>Free-will</font> , so
dishonourable to the <font>Free-Grace</font> of God?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are great Boasters of <font>Grace</font> , and yet are
the greatest Enemies to it in the World. Is it
<font>Grace</font> in God to have no Pity on Millions of his
helpless Creatures, but decree them to Hell for
being unhappily born? Is it <font>Grace</font> in God to
order his Son to die for a very small part of
Mankind only, when without suffering any more he
might have died for all? Is it <font>Grace</font> in God to
send abroad his Gospel and Ministers to spread the
News of a Saviour; when hereby the Number of
the <font>Reprobated</font> cannot be diminished, nor the
<font>Elect</font> increased? Is it <font>Grace</font> in God to command
Men to do, what he never gave them Power to
do? Is it <font>Grace</font> in God to offer Men a Saviour,
whom he knows they cannot accept? Is it <font>Grace</font>
to condemn Men for not believing in a Christ who
never died for them, and in whom they never cou'd
believe without irresistible Grace, which is yet
denied them? Are your Ministers the <font>Preachers
of Grace</font> then? Are they not the chief
Disparagers of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> However you represent the Matter, our
Ministers preach <font>Christ</font> and <font>Free-Grace</font> more than
any other Men, and for this Reason we admire
and like 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know they have about twenty or thirty
hackney Words and Phrases, which come into
almost every Sermon; take these from them and
they are at a full stand, and can't make another
<pagebreak id="29" />
Sermon. <font>Free-Grace</font> is one of this precious List.
But, in my Opinion, they are the best Preachers
of <font>Christ</font> and <font>Free-Grace</font> , who open, inforce and
apply the whole Gospel, of which the Sermons
of <font>Jesus Christ</font> are doubtless a Principal Part.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seem to put off the Article of <font>Free-will</font> .
as if afraid to meddle with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If by <font>Free-will</font> you mean a Faculty or
Power in Man, to turn his Thoughts to this subject, or
another; to do good or ill Actions, to choose the
way of Life or of Death, when both are set
before him; to receive or reject the offers of Christ,
when fairly made; I can't but think every Man
hath this sort of <font>Free-will</font> But your Preachers.
have made a <font>Bugbear</font> of the Word, and try to
fright Women and Children out of their Senses
by it. And the sound of <font>Free-Will</font> terrifies some
weak-headed Men almost as much as the sight of
a <font>Ghost</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seem to raise the Creature very high:
This exalting of Man tempts him to be proud
of himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I raise him higher than the Stones of the
Field, and the Beasts of the Earth, because God
has rais'd him higher. Nor is it any
Temptation to Pride for a Man to believe himself a
<font>Reasonable Creature</font> , and a <font>Free-Agent</font> ; but that he
is a reasonable Creature is a Motive to
admiring Thankfulness; and that he is a Free-Agent
is a Motive to Watchfulness, Diligence and
Caution. Besides you who declaim against
<font>Free-Agency</font> , act upon this Principle as much as other
Men: You expect to be praised when you do
well; you blame Men who cheat you; you call to
<pagebreak id="30" />
Account your Servants and Children, reward and
punish as you think they deserve; you exhort and
perswade to Religion and good Works: Thus you
act and live upon the Principle of <font>Free-Agency</font> ,
while in Words you deny it. Thus do
Antinomian Notions in Divinity turn Men's Heads, and
quite intoxicate their Brains; so that tho' on any
other subject they talk sensibly, as soon as they
enter the subject of Divinity, they begin to rave
and talk wildly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I allow Men <font>free to Evil</font> , but not to Good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Unhappy Case! better for us we had never
been made, than made under a necessity of
Sinning. Is Man the Workmanship of a wise and 
merciful God, who has only given him a Power
to <font>ruin</font> , but no Power to help himself? Besides
<font>free to Evil</font> , is like the Rest of your Divinity,
Self-contradictory; what Freedom is there,
without a Power to do good. God's Law is, <font>Cease
to do Evil, Learn to do Well</font> ; does not this imply
a Power to do it, or as much Freedom to do Well
as to do Ill; unless bad Habits and Custom in Sin
have, in a moral Sense weakened this Power? 
Besides, if Men have no Power to do good, how
are they <font>upon Trial</font> , whether they will behave
well or ill? And if they have no Power over
their own Actions, how will they be <font>judged</font> at last?
Why are Men <font>perswaded</font> and exhorted to do
good, if they have no Power, or no Direction of
that Power? Is any thing <font>Duty</font> , which is
impossible? Is not yours strange Doctrine, which at
once over-throws the grand Doctrine of a
future Judgment; and renders needless and
ridiculous all Preaching?
<pagebreak id="31" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Man had a Power to do good, but lost it
in <font>Adam</font> , and God is not obliged to restore it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the old senseless Story confuted
before, and which indeed confutes it self. Are
you conscious of any Being or Powers you had
four or six thousand Years ago? Let <font>Adam</font> bear
his own Guilt, and every Man his. But
supposing this Doctrine as possilble, true and just; as
it is impossible, false and unjust; yet is it fair to
<font>treat me</font> , as if I had a Power which I have not;
and to <font>judge</font> and <font>condemn me</font> for what the Judge
knows I have no Power to do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You talk as if Man had a Power to <font>convert
himself</font> , without the Almighty and irresistible
Grace of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Man may go on so long in a Course of
Sin, till he is grown hard and inflexible, and has
lost all Inclination to turn to God and a new Life.
But to say a Man <font>cannot turn to God</font> under the
Light, Calls and Aids of the Gospel, is to
represent God as very weak and unjust, to be at so
much Expence in calling Men to Impossibilities.
It is to make the Gospel not only a useless, but a
deceitful Institution. It is an intolerable Abuse of
Mankind, and makes their Case almost desperate.
Will a good God thus tantalize his own Children?
Is this the Doctrine of <font>Grace</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But our Teachers all say, That no Man
can come to God unless irresistible Grace draw
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then He cannot help turning, then there
can be <font>no Fault</font> in not turning; and <font>no Virtue</font> in
turning to God. A fine Account of the Gospel!
Are Men <font>to be blamed</font> for not having irresistible
<pagebreak id="32" />
Grace? Or <font>commended</font> for not resisting
Almighty Power? Will God <font>punish</font> Men for ever in Hell
for <font>not being elected</font> , which was his own Act,
not theirs; or for <font>not being converted</font> , which was
to be effected by his Power, not theirs? Or will
God <font>reward</font> Men for ever in Heaven, for doing
what they cou'd not help doing; or for what they
really did not, but what God himself did in them?
Is this judging Men according to their Works?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard our Divines say, God will
reward his own Work, and crown his Grace with
Glory.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Preachers have got the wonderful Art
of perswading their Hearers, that all their
mysterious Nonsense is sublime Divinity. God will
reward Men according <font>to their own Works</font> , not
according to his; And if Men improve well the
Grace of the Gospel, their Piety and Virtue,
Labours and Faithfulness shall be crown'd with
Glory. This is the Doctrine of the Bible, plain,
intelligible Doctrine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Still I can't believe that any Man can come
to Christ except God the Father draw him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And is not God drawing all Men, who live
under the Gospel, by Cords of a Man, and Bands
of Love? But Men do resist the Holy Ghost,
and when God wou'd heal them will not be
healed, nor come to Christ for Life; being
unfruitful, and disobedient.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are still for exalting Man, and laying
stress upon his Righteousness and good Works;
whereas all our Righteousness is as filthy Rags;
and I expect to be saved only for the
Righteousness of Christ imputed to me and received by
Faith.
<pagebreak id="33" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I allow the false and deceitful, the out-side
and ceremonial Righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees, of <font>Jewish</font> and Christian Hypocrites;
their Fastings, Tears and long-whining Prayers,
their furious and blind Zeal for dry Opinions and
Doctrines of Men, may well enough be compar'd
to <font>filthy Rags</font> . But I hope the Righteousness of
the Saints, their Love and good Works, their
Holiness and Obedience, their Mercy and
Charity; their living soberly, justly, devoutly, is not
Filthiness and Rags; unless you will call the
Image of God, and Imitation of Christ Filthiness.
Is not Righteousness and Loving Kindness,
being Good, and doing Good, the Glory of God?
and is it not the highest Perfection of Man? Does
not this render Men <font>lovely</font> , procure them a <font>good
Report</font> , and intitle them to <font>Praise</font> and <font>Honour</font>
at the coming of Jesus Christ? And will you
dare to call it all <font>Filthiness</font> and Rags? Take care,
Neighbour how you fling Dirt on God's Image,
affront the Spirit of Holiness, contradict the whole
Gospel, confound Holiness and Unholiness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But <font>Paul</font> renounced his own Righteousness,
which is of the Law, and trusted to that which
is thro' the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness
which is of God by Faith. <font>Phil. iii. 9.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His <font>Jewish</font> Righteousness, or Conformity
to the Ceremonial Law, he did renounce; he
trusted not in Circumcision, his Relation to
<font>Abraham</font> , his bitter persecuting Zeal. <font>Ver. 4, 5, 6.</font>
But his <font>Christian</font> Righteousness, his Conformity
to the Gospel, he did not, he cou'd not renounce.
No, this was his chief Endeavour, to conform to
Christ in Sufferings and a new Life, in pressing
<pagebreak id="34" />
after the Mark, by holy Obedience, in walking
by the Rule of the Gospel, and in a heavenly
Conversation. <font>Ver. 10, ----21.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare trust to no Righteousness and good
Works of my own for Acceptance with God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But dare you trust God's Word, that if you
continue in well-doing, and seek, in that way
Honour, Glory and Immortality, you shall have
eternal Life? Trusting in God to be saved in the
Way of Faithfulness and Gospel Obedience, at
the End, (and as the Crown) of a Sober, Just,
Charitable, Religious Life, is not trusting <font>your
own Righteousness</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sensible I am a guilty Creature, and can
plead nothing of my own, therefore I trust in
the imputed Righteousness of Christ.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are all guilty before God; but if
renewed by Repentance, we are incouraged by the
Gospel to plead that Repentance as a
Qualification for, and Title to Pardon. As to the <font>imputed
Righteousness of Christ</font> ,  it is a Phrase no where
to be found in God's Book, nor is easy to be
understood, and I wonder you shou'd be so fond of
it, and lay such stress upon it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our Divines have always spoke of this as
a Fundamental Doctrine, and I cannot give it up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Divines have used themselves to talk
wild and strange Things; have bewitched
People with their Sorceries, and led Captive silly
Women by sugared Phrases, but at the Bottom
a poysonous Doctrine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wonder you shou'd thus represent so great
a Gospel Doctrine.
<pagebreak id="35" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As there is not a Word of it in the Gospel; so
it is an Encouragement to bad Men and loose
Women, who, tho' destitute of Virtue and
Goodness, tho' without Sobriety, Chastity and a good
Life, yet hope to be saved by the Righteousness
of another, while they have none of their own.
Thus are the Hands of the wicked strengthened,
and Virtue and Vice confounded. This Doctrine
is also a Discouragement to good Men; as if all
their Labours of Love, their Obedience,
Faithfulness, Diligence, Self-denial, Charity, Goodness
were nothing Worth; unless they also believe in
the unscriptural and unintelligible Doctrine of
the Righteousness of another imputed to them.
