 <head>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
COVENT-GARDEN.</head> 

<nonSpeech>A Young Gentleman somewhat
addicted to Poetry and the
Diversions of the Stage,
standing one Evening behind the Scenes in
<font>Drury-lane</font> Playhouse, was accosted
with a Message by the Door-keeper,
that a Lady in the Entrance desir'd
to speak with him; he readily obey'd
the Charge, but was strangly surpris'd
to be saluted by a Voice well known
to him, and a Person whom he
imagin'd in another Kingdom (one whom
<pagebreak id="2" />
he passionately lov'd) and whose
absence he much regretted; their Joys
were mutual at the Interview, but
his the greater, because heightn'd by
surprise and unexpectancy;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>for
Heavens sake, Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the Spark in a
transport</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>is your Husband dead?
and may I hope at last that you are
mine</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lady answer'd only by a
deep Sigh, and conducting him to
the Coach which waited for her, she
gave him the following account.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>You
may remember, my dear</font> Peregrine,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that constrain'd by the
Rigour of covetous Parents, who
consulted my Fortune, not Inclinations, I broke
my Vows and Protestations to you and
married</font> Richly. <font>Revive not the fatal
remembrance</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>answer'd</font> Peregrine) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>which occasion'd me so much misery,
forcing me thro grief to leave the
Kingdom, and come hither for</font> London,
<font>but rather declare the cause which so
happily has Blest me now with your
Presence so far beyond my hopes</font> . <font>Alas
<pagebreak id="3" />
Sir</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>reply'd</font> Emilia,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>why shou'd you Sir,
doubt the occasion, knowing your self and
knowing me? how could I rest in the
Embraces of Another, whilst nothing
but a narrow Sea parted me from my
dear</font> Peregrine. <font>I gave my friends
the satisfaction to see me married to</font>
Richly, <font>but did my self the Justice to
live with none but my Dearest</font> . --
</dialogue><nonSpeech>with which words pressing his Hand,
and letting her Head fall with a Sigh
in his Bosom, she murmur'd out the
rest in a Language which Lovers only
understand. The Coach stopt in
<font>Bow-street Covent-Garden</font> , where the
Lady had taken Lodgings.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />

<pagebreak id="6" />
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>there was
none of the company dispos'd to
comply with his humour, but a 
Captain, who swearing a bloudy
Oath that put his Scarlet out of
countenance, declar'd he would Drink for

to Town; but what is yet stranger, I
have not yet enjoy'd her, tho I have
seen her twice</font> . <font>I shou'd think it more
strange</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font> Peregrine) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>if you ever
enjoy her, if she be one that values her
Reputation</font> . Zoons </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>cry'd the
Captain</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you look like an honest Fellow,
<pagebreak id="7" />
and I'll tell you a secret; My Mistress
is the prettiest Lady in</font> England, <font>and
she Lodges hard by in</font> Bow-street. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The
whole Company, who knew that
<font>Peregrine</font> Courted a Lady in <font>Bow-street</font> ,
burst out a Laughing, and one of them
ask'd the Captain where abouts his
Mistress liv'd?</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>About the middle of
the Street</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd he</font> ) which increas'd
the Laughter all about the Table.
Here appear'd another Caprice in the
humour of our Lover: <font>Peregrine</font> ,
who just now had forgot and laid by
all thoughts of his former Mistress,
had his passion renew'd by the
apprehension of a Rival, and his Flame
like other Fire, meeting with
opposition, began to rage more furiously;
he ask'd the Captain what
incouragment he had receiv'd, to authorise
him to call that Lady Mistress?</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Only
this</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the Captain</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that I am
belov'd by her above all Men in the
World, for which I have her own
Declaration</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Peregrine</font> being sensible
<pagebreak id="8" />
how far a Lac'd Coat and Feathers
usually work upon the Female Sex,
was very uneasy, and calling a
Reckoning left the Company.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

<font>O</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>dear Sir, yonder's my

we find not a device to impose upon

</dialogue><nonSpeech>The Captain very willing to oblige

and puting on the Porters Coat,
Frock, and Apron, slunk down Stairs
by <font>Peregrine</font> undiscover'd, leaving
the gawdy Porter in <font>Emilia's</font>
Chamber; which so much occasioned
<pagebreak id="22" />
<font>Peregrine's</font> wonder. He had the
demonstration of his Eyes that it was
the Captain but some Minutes
before, and now by the same Evidence
it appears that it is not he.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This is
all Illusion</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font> Peregrine <font>in a
Consternation</font> ) .</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Illusion</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>replyed</font>
Emilia) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I little thought that</font> Peregrine
<font>could have such ill thoughts of Me,
as to believe I would entertain an
Officer at this Hour in my Chamber</font> .
<font>Truly Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>answered</font> Peregrine) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>tho Love be blind, I don't think
Jealousy is so, and tho Womens Beauty
depends on our fancy, their Vertue
does not; we rightly can Judge of
that, tho not of tother</font> . <font>Sir</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font> 
Emilia) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you have never received any
proofs of my immodesty, tho many of
my Love, and I therefore think it
both ingratitude and injustice in you
to tax my Vertue, which you ought
to defend, since you are sensible it has
held out even against you whom I so
dearly lov'd, and who (I thought)
<pagebreak id="23" />
lov'd me, but I find now too late that I
have been mistaken</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>upon which she
burst out in Tears.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Go back Sir</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said
she to the Porter</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>and tell your Lord
that I begin to suspect his designs upon
me for vicious; alas, I am
unacquainted with the Tricks of this City, and
did not imagine that a Nobleman could
have any base designs upon a Poor
Womans Honour; go quickly to him, I
say, and bid him never trouble me
again, for he has made me already an
unfortunate Woman</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>With which

</dialogue><nonSpeech> (Peregrine <font>smild at her Female
ignorance</font> .) <font>But she continued</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I have
one thing to offer in this dispute, which
I think sufficient to convince you; I
suppose the chief design of Plays is to
please the People, and get the
Play-house and Poet a Livelyhood</font> . <font>You
must pardon me Madam</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>replyed</font>
Peregrine) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Instruction is the business
of Plays</font> . <font>Sir</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the Lady</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>make it the business of the Audience
First to be pleas'd with Instruction,
and then I shall allow you it to be
the chief end of Plays</font> . <font>But suppose
Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that I grant what
you lay down</font> . <font>Then Sir</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>answered she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>you must allow that what ever Plays
most exactly Answer this aforesaid
end, are the most exact Plays. Now
I can instance you many Plays, as all
those by</font> Shakespear <font>and</font> Johnson, <font>and
the most of Mr.</font> Dryden's, <font>which you
<pagebreak id="33" />
Criticks quarrel at as irregular, which
nevertheless still continue to please
the Audience, and are a continual
support to the</font> Theatre; <font>there's very 
little of your Unity of time or place in
any of them, yet they never fail to
Answer the proposed end very
succesfully. Besides Sir, I have heard your
self say, that Poetry is purely an
imitation of Nature; what business then
can Art pretend in the affair</font> ? <font>O
Madam</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Answered</font> Peregrine) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>this
Art is only the improvement or
perfection of Nature, and is us'd in
Poetry, as Geometrical Lines in Painting
do delineate the peice to an exact
Model or Form</font> . <font>Then certainly</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>replyed the Lady</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>these rules are ill
understood, or our Nature has
changed since they were made; for we find
they have no such effects now as they
had formerly. For Instance, I am told
the</font> (Double Dealer) <font>and</font> , (Plot and
no Plot) <font>are two very exact Plays, as
you call them, yet all their Unity of
<pagebreak id="34" />
Time, Place, and Action, neither
pleased the Audience, nor got the
Poets Money. A late Play too call'd</font>
(Beauty in Distress) <font>in which the
Author, no doubt, sweat as much in
confining the whole Play to one Scene,
as the Scene-Drawers should were it to
be changed a hundred times; this
Play had indeed a commendatory
Copy from Mr.</font> Dryden, <font>but I think he
had better have altered the Scene,
and pleased the Audience; in short
had these Plays been a little more
exact, as you call it, they had all been
exactly Damn'd</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Peregrine</font> would
have answered, but a pluck by the
Sleeve obliged him to turn from
<font>Selinda</font> to entertain a Lady Mask'd
who had given him the Nudg; he
presently knew her to be <font>Emilia</font> ,
who whisperd him in the Ear,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I find

In short</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continued she Weeping</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>my
Passion for you has drawn me into a
necessity of being troublesom to one
whose kindness will perhaps flow from
a Principle of Charity, not Love. But
Sir, (I scorn to be pitied; and if I

to be an Object of your Compassion</font> .
<font>Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>replied he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>my Charity may
extend to share Superfluities, but no

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Upon which he gave her Ten <font>Guineas</font> ,

dear</font> Peregrine </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>says she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am too
sensible of the unhappiness of your
Circumstances, and will therefore Trespass
no further upon them: You shall only
spare me some of your Love to lay out
upon Another, and that shall pay the
Ransom for your Money</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Peregrine
<font>was strangely surprised at her
Discourse</font> !</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Be not startled, Sir</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said
she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>for a Proof of your Affection it
<pagebreak id="50" />
must be so; I have long been Solicited
by my Lord C-- and have
received some Presents from Him, and
was in a fair way of Commanding what
I pleased, had not my unlucky
kindness to you at the Play last Night
raised his Jealosy to that Degree,
that he has forsaken me. Now, Sir,
since your circumstances debar you from
recompencing the loss, I think you are
obliged to be Instrumental to Me in
recovering his Affection; but do not
think (my Dearest) that he can ever
destroy your Interest in my Heart, but
rather heighten it, being a means to
support that Love which the 
scantiness of your Fortune would Starve</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Very reasonable Arguments to make
<font>Peregrine</font> a downright Pimp! He was
strangely Netled, but being resolv'd
to see the Utmost.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>How Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said
he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>can I be Instrumental in your
Reconciliation with his Lordship</font> ? <font>Only
thus</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>Replied she</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you must know
<pagebreak id="51" />
he is wonderfully Charmed with Wit
and Writing fine, in a Woman; now
I am sensible you have an Excellent
Talent in Epistolary Style, (which I must
still remember since first your
Charming Letters conquered me;) you must
therefore write an Ingenious Letter
for me, which I will Transcribe, and
send to his Lordship, which will
Infallibly reclaim him</font> . <font>But suppose
Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font> Peregrine) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that my
Lord discovers the difference of Stile
if you Write to him again</font> ? <font>No, no</font>

immediately conceiving, that by this
means he should see my Lord <font>C--'s</font>
Letters, and thereby discover if the
Intreague went any further then he 
would have it, undertook the Task,

the desired effect.</nonSpeech>
