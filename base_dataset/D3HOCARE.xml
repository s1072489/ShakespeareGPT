</dialogue> <head>THE COUNTRY MANS CARE,
AND 
THE CITIZENS FEARE IN THESE
DANGEROUS, AND TROUBLESOME TIMES.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Citizen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well met <font>Countryman</font> , what is the best newes
that the Country doth afford at this
time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas sir! I wonder you should
so earnestly enquire newes of mee, that
live in the Countrey, whenas we receive all our newes
from you. I confesse, you did prevent mee, therefore I
pray, what is the best newes in the City?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas! the ambiguous rotation of the World
is very mutable, nothing is constant, nothing durable,
but all things doe praecipitate themselves most strangly
in a mutuall levitie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This newes is hard indeed: for I did expect
better, in regard that I have a Son, truely a pritty
Scholler (as his Master tells me) and of a hopefull
expectation, whose preferment I intend to raise (God willing)
Therefore I beseech you (if you can) instruct me, what
way I may settle him in.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can he understand the Latine tongue, or
how farre hath he proceeded therein?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely sir he is past his <foreign>Propribus que        
maribus</foreign> ,
&amp; his <foreign>Asse in praesentibus</foreign> too I'le assure you; yea, &amp; he can
reade any Chapter in the Bible very punctifully, and
withall he hath read toe Master Practise on the Piety,
and many other Godly bookes I thanke God for it, who
hath endewed him with so much grace: Therefore
because he is come to some knowledge now, I would
willingly bring him up to some Scholler-ship: what think
you Sir, if I should send him to the Vniversity?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir I commend your sedulity herein: but I have
often heard, and withall I know by experience, that the
Vniversity is much polluted, and contaminated with
Popish superstitions, which if your sonne should be
seduced into, perhaps it will cause both his utter ruine, and
your perpetuall sorrow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it possible that the Vniversity should be
corrupt? Tis no marvell then that the whole kingdome is
misled, since the very fountaines themselves are
poluted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Exhort you as a friend; and hope you will not
contemne my friendly admonition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But my Son may avoid their crafty
allurements, and if he then uncessantly follow his studdy, he
may one day prove a Minister of Gods word.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pish, a minister of Gods word quother? Now
a dayes every man will become a Minister: therefore it
will be but vanity for you to send your sonne thither to
attaine to the Sacerdotiall function.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But dare every man presume so farre without
learning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is the chiefe cause thereof: for learning is
abused, contemned, derided, neglected, despised: they

will have noe praying, nor preaching, unlesse it be
performed by instinct and inspiration, as the spirit mooves
them. And if a man heapes up knowledge, and
Scholler-ship by indefatigable studdy, he is thought to have
fild his mind only with more advantage to doe
wickednesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh lamentable!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea you may see Coblers and Tinkers rising
from the very Dunghill, beating the Pulpits as
conformably, as if they were the Kinges professors of Divinity,
scattering their new doctrine and discipline in the
Church, and are accounted great divines too of the
vulgar. Here you shall see one making himselfe a Prophet
preaching in a Tub as confidently, as if he were Doctor
in Divinity. There you shall see another thumping forth
his new doctrine in a Barne among his conniticles (I
should have said) conventicles, as if he were Master of
Artes. In the meane while revolve all, and you shall
finde Scholler-ship most shamefully despised.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But if he diligently continue in his studdy,
God knowes but that he may one day become a Bishop.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citix.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? a Bishop? alas! I feare there will be no
more of that dignity: for the generall assent and consent
too of the Commons will admit of no Bishops: and
they must all very shortly resigne their Titles, which
shall be abrogated. Your sonne shall never be
Arch-Bishop I'le warrant you: and if you intend to make a
Divine of him, he must have a great care least the
Arch-Bishop doe not cut of his eares. But I will free you from
that feare, for I tell once againe that there will be no
more Bishops: Yet if it seemes more just, and secure,
that the holy Church should admit a degree of lesse, and
greater, they will have no Bishops, but onely
Lay-Elders: to the election of which dignity, they judge and
<pagebreak id="6" />
suppose none more fit, and none more prepared for the
performance of every thing, belonging to Gods word,
then those venerable, and reverend Fathers Master
<font>Cobler, Tinker</font> , and <font>Button-maker</font> , men (although but of a
meane Scholler-ship) yet most wonderfully inspired.
Therefore I think it it meere vanity for you, to bring your
sonne up to be a Scholler.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Couut.</font> </comment> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas! then what     
shall I doe? unlesse I should
put him to the Innes a Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soe you'l make a young <font>Suckling</font> of him, and
then he'l run away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I intend to make him a <font>Lawyer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas the Starre-Chamber, and
High-Commission Court is downe long agone: and he must be as
busie as a <font>Ducke</font> , or else he will loose preferment. For
Lawyers are not respected, neither are they accounted
Honest, because they sell their lines dearer then
<font>Apothecaries</font> Physicks, which I confesse is deare enough, yet
nothing comparable to the price of their lines, which gape
wider then an Oyster-wifes mouths, and straddle wider
then a French-man's legs. Fie, fie! Lawyers are accounted
Knaves over all the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis strange! For I'm sure they have more
Angels come hourely to them in Terme time, then all the
Puritans in the Towne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But here lyes the difference: Their Angels doe
weare crosses: and because the Puritans will admit of
no crosse, therefore they hate the Lawyers the more,
because they are so ready to receive them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And there is none of their whole Tribe, that
will deny such crosses, I'le warrant you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But Lawyers are so little regarded now adayes,
that I feare before they can procure other men's Suites
at Law, they'le want Suites to their owne Backs.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But perhaps he may come to the honour of a
Iudge one day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you doe not desire to have your Sonne
hang'd. That's a dangerous title I'le assure you: Did
you not heare that most of the Iudges are to be judged
under other Iudges, yea and they'le hardly escape
hanging too, unlesse they give ample satisfaction to the
Parliament: for they are acknowledged to be the Originall
of all our greivances. Therefore if you be wise desist
from that opinion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas! What education shall I then impose
upon my Son? Since all these grounds of hope hath
deceived me. What thinke you Sir, if I traine him up to
be a Souldier?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He must sweare lustily then: and bragge of
many things with ostentation, although he can performe
nothing. But stay! Now I thinke on it: Perhaps he may
be suspected to be some Trooper, (for they say the
Countrey is very full of them) then apprehended and so
incontinently committed onely upon suspicion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say true indeed Sir: Therefore I know not
what course to take with him. I intreat you Sir, to lend
me your advice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Lad be so hopefull, as you declare him to
be: I care not greatly if I take him under my Tuition,
and if you please to condescend thereunto, he shall be
my Apprentice, and I'le assure you for your sake he shall
be both kindly kept, and religiously instructed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I humbly thank you for your love, wherefore
I acknowledge my selfe much ingaged to you: But I
pray what trade are you off Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a Vintner by my Trade.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am very glade to heare of that: and if my
Sonne be wise enough, but to take fourty Shilling a
<pagebreak id="8" />
Tunne, he may prove an Alderman too. Well Sir, I am
much obleiged unto you, for your love unto him, and
I will bring him unto you, and if you like his morality
and ingenuity, I will willingly send him unto you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Citiz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He shall be most lovingly respected.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thankes Noble Sir; In the meane while farewell.
