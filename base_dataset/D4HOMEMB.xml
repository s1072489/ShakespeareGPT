</dialogue> <head>A 
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, A DIVINE, A
LAWYER, A FREEHOLDER, A SHOPKEEPER, AND A
COUNTRY FARMER, &amp;C.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Freeholder.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Worship is wellcome into the
Country, you have been kind to us this time, and
made more hast down then we expected, we
never wanted the Gentlemen to live amongst us more than now,
for all our Comodities lie upon our hands, we can vent
nothing, we must be forc'd to Eat what God hath sent us,
in our own Families, if we can sell as much as will pay Taxes,
it is all we can expect or hope for, God help the poor
Farmers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God help us poor Farmers indeed, I am glad to
see your Worship well, I must depend on your Forbearance
this year, or else my poor Family must be ruined, I thank
God I can pay you in stock, if you'll take Cattle and Sheep,
but I can get no Money for them, unless I will sell to
great Loss.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Member.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you good Neighbors, I am glad to see
you both well, how does your good Families, I thank you
for your kindness in coming to see me, and bidding me so
heartily wellcome into the Country, but I am sorry to hear
such dismal Complaints of the Market, how shall the
Landlord live at this rate, if he can have no Rents? especially
we that spend so much Money in <font>London</font> , in the Service of
our Country.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lawyer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Money be so scarce in the Country, I doubt
we shall have but a bad Harvest next Term in
<font>Westminster-Hall</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Divine.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come Gentelmen take Courage, providence is
sufficient for all, God send us good Success in <font>Germany,
Flanders</font> , and <font>Italy</font> , and we shall recover from these         
misfortunes
again, we are happy that we can enjoy that little we have
in Peace and Quietness. It is a great Blessing to us, that
<font>England</font> is not made the Seat of War, that we have not a
standing Army in the Nation, and the Souldiers quartered
in our houses, and that we can preserve our goods from
Plunder, and our Wifes and Daughters from Rape and
Violence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In troth Sir, you say right, for I shall never    
forget
the late troublesome times, when we could call nothing
our own, and could neither keep our Wifes, our Daughters,
our Money, or our goods to our selves: God be praised
that little we have at present, we quietly enjoy; but pray
Master how long shall we do so? What is the meaning of
these disputes between the L--ds and C--ns, we begin
to think our selves fine Folks in the Country, when those
that should Govern begin to appeal to us; but for our parts
you might as well have kept your Proceedings and
Resolutions to your selves, as sent them down to us, for we
learn nothing by them, but that our Neighbours are going
together by the Ears
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so, I am sorry for that, Neighbor, they were
sent down with another intent, that you might be Judges of
the reasonableness of our Proceedings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's well contriv'd indeed, we send you up to
Judge for us, because it is impossible for us all to meet and
Judge for our selves, and you send your Proceedings down
to us, that we may Judge of our Judges, we appeal to you
as the wise Men of our Nation, and you appeal to us, as
if you had no Wisdom at all; pray Master pardon me, if I
am too bold, but if this be the way of it, we had as good
Judge for our selves at first, and never give you the
trouble to go to <font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am so far from being offended with you for this
Freedom that I am well enough pleased with it, for I assure you
I am one that was always against perplexing the People's
heads with Politicks and News, or Printing so much
as the Votes of the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish all the Parliament Men were of your mind,  
for I
can hardly get a Labourer or Plowman but they will be
<pagebreak id="5" />
Running to the next Town to hear the news, and then they come
home with some dismall Story or other, which puts them so
out of humour, that they cannot speak nor whistle to the
Oxen for two or three days, and perhaps a month after they
begin to understand the meaning of the news better, and
what they at first apprehended to our prejudice, appears to be
for the publick advantage: So we are like to be rich, whilst
you are Laying heavy Taxes on us above, and at the same
time sending down printed papers to confound the brains of
our workmen, and draw them away from helping us to get
money to pay them;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shopkeeper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really Sir, this honest Freeholder Speaks a
great deal of truth, for I am sure I have lost more in my
way of Trading by my Prentices running to the
Coffee-houses to read the News, than by all the Taxes of the Late
Reign, and yet there was no reason to Complain of the 
smallness of them neither;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, in my Conscience; but Sir, these printed
papers have made us all mad, I can never go to the Market,
but I meet with some Rascallions or other, that assaults me with
hard words about my Landlord; Your master is a brave
man (say they) to take bribes from <font>France</font> , and to sacrifice
his Country to Popery and Slavery; and when I ask them
what they mean; who puts those strange Notions into their
heads? They presently pull out a paper and shew me your
name in Print, and a great many more, who they say have
conspir'd together to Ruin their Country; and if I happen
to speak one word in your defence, if I tell them you have
always been a Patriot of your Country, and all your
Ancestors before you, If I tell them you have a great Estate, a
fine Lady, many hopeful Children and the like, and can any
Man think that you can be Bribed to sell them all to Popery,
and French Dragoons? they will not hearken at all, but are
ready to knock out my Brains, and Swear that I am one of
your listed Troopers, to serve against your Country, and so
bring in the pretended Prince of <font>Wales</font> , and sometimes I
am forc'd to leave my Goods unsold, for fear of them; I am
sure I shall never be able to pay my Rent at this rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Liberty of the Press will be the ruin of the
Nation, and I must Confess any thing that doth but Look
like an appeal to the Collective Body of the People, is of
very dangerous consequence to the Constitution, you had
better a great deal to keep your disputes to your selves,
than Communicate them to the Publick, for if you cannot
agree togeather, who are the great Council of the Nation,
<pagebreak id="6" />
who come from all Corners of the Kingdom, who are well
instructed and able to Debate and Reason the Case with
one another, how can you imagine that the People will
ever agree, who can never meet together to argue the
Point? You have really the best Constitution of
Government in the World, and at this rate you'll make it the
Worst.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say very well Sir, for as a late Author hath
observed, <font>The appealing from the Parliament to the People is
to make use of the Peoples strength to destroy themselves, it is
to appeal from order and method, to nonsense and confusion, to
appeal from the People in that Capacity, wherein alone they
are capable to Act with prudence and safety</font> (and that is by their
Representatives) <font>to the People in another Capacity wherein they
are never able to meet but in Parties and Factions, nor able to bring
any dispute to a Determination without Clubs and Staves, or worse
Weapons</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is very true, and the Last Sessions we got the  
House
of C--ns to be made Sensible of it, for it plainly appearing
at the free conferrence with the L--ds, that the
misunderstanding about the proceedings relating to the A--r of the
R--pt of the <font>Exchequer</font> were chiefly owing to the printing
of our Votes, wherein they say a Member of their House was
publickly Censured in print, in the Sight of the whole Nation;
before he was convicted on a Tryal at Law; tho' the Commons
did hardly think that to be a Sufficient reason for their
Proceeding. Yet to avoid giving any handle for such another
dispute, the House came to a Resolution not to print their Votes
any more; so very desireous were the C--ns to preserve
a right understanding with the L--ds for the Common
good of this Nation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then did they print their proceedings
concerning the Bill for preventing Occasional Confirmity?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because they understood that the L--ds made an
order for printing their Arguments upon it, and therefore they
thought it requisite to print theirs too; or else I hope you'll
not be much Troubled with printing from our House any
more;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what is the meaning of it, that the L--ds      
proceedings
upon the said Bill are not only printed at Large as they used
to be, but they are reprinted in a less Character, and many
Thousands of them printed by Subscription of private Persons,
industriously dispersed all over the Kingdom, and sold at a Low
rate under the usual price.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These are very extraordinary proceedings indeed,
and I cannot imagine what the meaning can be, unless they
are also making Subscriptions for a Dissolution of the
Parliament; but that will never do with the Ministers in this Reign,
they have not such Tools to work upon as they had formerly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope not, or else we should be in a miserable
condition; but I have taken notice that there is a Gentleman in our
Country, who imploys so many Mercury's to disperse those
Papers with Comments upon them; that there is never a
Messenger to be had for Money in all our Neighbourhood.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have a great many busy People in this Nation:
But why did you censure the A--r of the R--pt in Print?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because we thought he had highly neglected his     
duty,
and that it was time (when the Nation was engag'd in a War, and
Twenty Millions in Debt) to Prosecute some, in order to deterr
others; for we can never hold out long at this rate; we have
Mortgag'd all the other Funds, and there is nothing else left,
but the Land must now bear the burthen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt of it, God help us poor Freeholders, it  
is
time to punish Offenders indeed, it is plain her Majesty was of
that Opinion, when she was pleas'd to use these very words in
her Speech to the Parliament; <font>And that my Subjects may the more
Chearfully bear the necessary Taxes, I desire you to inspect the      
accounts
of all the Publick Receipts and Payments, and if there have been
any Abuses or Mismanagements, I hope you will detect them, that the
Offenders may be Punish'd, and others be deterr'd by such examples
from the like practices</font> . This was encouragement enough, but
why did not you Prosecute him first, and Censure him
afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Commons have but two ways of Prosecuting great
Men for any Offence, and that it is either by Impeachment, or
by Addressing the Queen to order her Attorney-General to
Prosecute at Law, and which way soever they take, their
Resolutions will be Printed if they Print their Votes; and they must
first come to a Resolution that a great Man is Guilty, before
they can either Impeach, or desire the Queen to Prosecute him,
for the Commons are in the nature of the grand Inquest of the
Nation, and must first find <font> <foreign>Billa Vera</foreign> </font> , before they can   
regularly
proceed any farther.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is plain, if you publish your Votes, your       
private
Censures and Resolutions will be publish'd too, not only to the
People of <font>England</font> , but to all the World, and therefore I have
often wondred that the great Council of the Nation should
take so much pains to expose their proceedings to their Enemies
abroad, as well as at home, when certainly it is for the interest
<pagebreak id="8" />
of any Kingdom that they should keep their Proceedings as
private as they can; The States of other Wise Nations
think it so; for tho' they do indeed publish on a particular
occasion, what they think convenient for the Information and
service of the Nation, yet all other matters are kept as
private as may be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If all Lawyers had been as Honest, and as little
Avaricious as you, Printing of Votes had never been brought in
fashion, for if I am not mistaken, it was a Gentleman of your
Profession that first brought in that practice for his own
Advantage, when he was Speaker of the House of Commons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember that Gentleman very well, he was one
that lov'd Money as well as another, and had more of mine
than I desir'd, or he deserv'd: But pray what was it worth to a
Speaker?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was formerly worth no more than Five Pounds a
Day, but now they say it is worth Ten, because they Pay
double Price for the Votes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ten Pounds a Day, that is Sixty Pound a Week, a
very pritty business; then I'll warrant you, the present Speaker
has too much Wit to part with such a Perquisite in his Office;
he might be contended to loose the Benefit of it for two Days
the last Sessions, but he'll make Friends enough to renew the
Order for Printing the Votes next Sessions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is your mistake, our present Speaker is a Man
of Honour, and scorns to Sacrifice the Interest of his Country
for any private Advantage; he was always against Printing the
Votes, and ever will be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That will be very honourable in him indeed; but if
this practice was so lately introduc'd, and by no better a Man
than the person you mean, I am contented it should be let
alone for the future. The Representatives of every County and
Burrough, will (I presume) take care to give notice of every
thing that relates to them in particular, and the whole House
will publish as much as is requisite to be known in general,
and for the rest you may keep it among your selves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This method of proceeding will make us more       
careful
what Members we Chuse for our Bourroughs; for as long as
the Votes were Printed, we knew what they were a doing in
Parliament, as well as our Members, and therefore it was no
great matter who were our Representatives, whether they 
liv'd in <font>London</font> , or in the Country, nor whether they attended
the publick Business or not; but now on my word, we must
take care to Chuse such as live amongst us, are concern'd for
the true Interest of our Burrough, and will be sure to atend
<pagebreak id="9" />
the publick service, or else we may suffer in our Priviledges,
or our Trade, before we are aware of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is an advantage to the Publick, that I did not
think of, and for ought I know, may be one good way to
prevent the Electors from taking Bribes in Elections, I am
sure the more you consider of Printing the Votes, the
better you will be pleased that we shall keep to the Ancient
Constitution of the Government, which never allowed of this
practice, but pray what did you mean by saying that you
learn nothing by publishing our Proceedings, but that your
Neighbours were going together by the Ears.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mean Sir, I mean to tell you the truth, that the
People begin already to take sides, some are for one, and
some for the other, and they are ready to Quarrel at every
meeting, which of them have the best of the Argument.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is very fine indeed, I was afraid of such Evil
consequences, and what do they generally say? on which side
are the Majority in your Neighborhood?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I must confess we have not many, that appear
against the C--ns, for we naturally incline to favour our
own Representatives, but the Dissenters (who are but few
amongst us) do generally incline to the other side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That must be expected, tho' if the Dissenters had
heard all the Debates in our House, they would be better
Satisfied with this Bill of <font>Occasional Conformity</font> then they are,
for if I can understand the matter, all the honest Dissenters
will have an advantage by it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish they may, and that some worthy Member of
your House would state the matter a little more at large
to us, for tho' the Arguments of the C--ns are very
strong, yet they are very short, and ordinary People do not
immediatly comprehend the Force of an Argument in so few
words; besides the Arguments on the other side are more
Copious, which makes them more easily apprehended by
vulgar Capacities.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The C--ns may be easily out done in matters of
this Nature, for they are a great body, full of business and
perpetually in a hurry, and others are more at leasure, and
take more pains in drawing up their proceedings; but I
think the Arguments on the other side are not rightly
grounded in this Case, tho' it must be confessed there is as
much said on that side as the nature of the Case would
admit, but they do not confine their Arguments to the
Subject matter of the Bill, which only relates to publick
Officers, and not to private Dissenters, which is indeed a plain
<pagebreak id="10" />
and short answer to all the Objections made against it, but
what do the People say to the other Proceedings
concerning the publick accounts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, there you have the advantage very clearly on
your side, for tho' some Persons seem to aim at a discovery
of mistakes by the Commissioners of accounts, of which I
am informed some are only Errors of the Clerk, and are
rectified in the other Papers given in before, yet they 
confess the substance with you, and prove more plainly then
you did; <font>That all the publick Accounts are far behind, and that
there has been great Mismanagements by the publick Officers</font> , and
tho' there may have been several Deficiencies in the Funds,
yet it does not follow, but that with good management, the
many Millions given by the Commons would have answer'd
all the <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: the the</comment> Publick occasions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't like the way of Arguing so much in favour
of offenders, which looks to me as if the first draft had been
made by some of the Parties concerned; and I observe that
they compute the deficiencies from the Estimates given it,
but perhaps the Estimates were as unreasonable as the
management, for both were under the care of the same
Persons; but suppose there have been some Deficiencies in the
supplies or in the produce of the Funds, does it therefore
follow that there hath been no Mismanagement? methinks
they Labour a little too much, to excuse the Parties Accused
by the C--ns.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And a little too soon in my opinion, for if they  
are
Innocent it will appear on a fair Tryal, without any
previous Arguments in their favour; but I must confess, I think
there are some things mentioned in the C--ns Address to
the Queen, upon the observations and Representations of
the Commissioners of Accounts, which prove themselves, and
(amongst the rest) <font>the Receivers and other publick Officers,
getting great Estates, at the Expence of the Publick</font> , for by
what other means could they get them? a great many of
them to my knowledge, had no other way to get a Penny,
and some that were hardly able to shew their heads, have
now got great Estates, and have no more Wit then to keep their
Coaches, that the world may know it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a very good method formerly
prescribed in this Case, if it had been put in practice, and that was
<font>To consider the value of their Estates when they were first
Employ'd by the Government, what it is now, and what they could
Honestly get by their Offices and Employments, and to resume the
overplus for the ease of People</font> .
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That would for ever prevent any publick Frauds,
but I am sure there is one thing mentioned in the C--ns
Address, that we Conveyancers were very sensible of, and
that was the Stock-jobbing Trade between the <font>Exchange</font> ,
and the <font>Exchequer</font> , for the Money'd men got so much that
way, that my poor Clyents could not borrow a penny of
Money tho' they were willing to give Procuration,
Continuation, <font>&amp;c.</font> Besides the Lawful Interest of Six <font>per       
Cent</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was not only an inconvenience to private
persons, but to the whole Kingdom, for there was so much
Money misemployed that way, that it Lessened the true
Trading Stock of the Nation, and thereby hindred the
exportation of our Woollen-Manufacture, <font>&amp;c.</font> and the importation  
of
other Comodities to be Manufactured in <font>England</font> , and yet we are
told on the otherside, that there were no Tallies with interest
Struck unnecessarily, all was well manag'd, and no Body in fault.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure there was something or other done
unnecessarily, for they got so much in this <font>Exchequer</font> Trade, that
Land was become a meer Drug; we could neither Sell nor
Mortgage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were not like to do either, when the greatest
Money'd men in the Kingdom sold their Estates in order to
lend the Money into the <font>Exchequer</font> , and what did they lend
it for? only out of their great zeal for the publick
Service? no doubt of it, they had no unnecessary Interest nor large
Premiums: Fie, fie, this daubing work will never do the
business of the Nation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is no wonder such men were willing to grant
heavy Taxes on the People, for they not only got by it, in
the <font>Exchequer</font> , where they doubled their Estates in a few
years, but slipt their Necks out of the Collar in the
Country, and avoided the Taxes, by selling their Estates to so
great an Advantage; but as to the publick Accounts and
striking of Tallies, let the Commissioners of Accounts
answer for themselves next Sessions: pray Sir, don't you plead
their Cause without a Fee; for my part I think they need
no Council, they have done very well, and are able to
Defend themselves, and if it had not been for them, we should
have had no account at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is certain, but I don't speak now as a Council
when I am retained for my Client, I must make the best
of his Cause, but now I may speak freely and impartially
without favouring either side, and I must confess I think
the Commissioners of Accounts deserve the thanks of the
Nation, they have acted like men of Honour, Quality and
<pagebreak id="12" />
Integrity, and have demonstrated the same, to the whole
Nation; what can they get by Quarelling with great Men?
if they consulted their own private Interest, and not the
good of their Country, they would accept the Complements,
the Caresses, and the Bribes that are usually offered on such
occasions; but it is plain they have stood Buff against all
Temptations, and been faithful to the true Interest of their
Queen and Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is very true, but what thanks have they had for
their Pains? here is a Hue and Cry, after their mistakes
but not one word in their Commendation; Is this the way
to Encourage honesty and Fidelity in publick Officers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will not be put out of conceit with them, for
all that, if these Observations had been printed before the
Parliament was Prorogued, we should have had an Answer,
Il'e warrant you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt of it, but what do you say to the good
management in the last Reign, when the late Ministers
prevailed on the King to give near three Millions out of
his own Revenue for the Service of the Nation? What do
you say to that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say to it, I am ashamed to hear it mentioned, what
sad Shifts are we forced to make, to save one another; the
Revenue of the Crown, is a publick Revenue; Three or
four hundred thousand pounds a year did formerly maintain the
Civil List, or expence of the Kings Household, and the residue was
to be employed in keeping the Fleet in good order, and in
other publick uses, and it has been formerly sufficient to
maintain a standing Army, but the Late King of Glorious
Memory, being at more expences in travelling abroad, and
treating the Foreign Ministers and Generalls for the good
of <font>England</font> ; The Estimates given in to the Parliament by
the Ministers for the <font>Civil List</font> , was generally five or six,
and for some years Seaven hundred thousand pound a year,
and the over plus above that was employed for the publick
Service, and carrying on the War against France <font>as it ought to
be, and as the good King designed it</font> , and thus you have this
great management of those Ministers explained to you;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this all? does not the Queen now do the very    
same
thing? She pays to the publick a rent Charge out of the
Revenue <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Revenne</comment> of the Crown, of three thousand     
seaven hundred
pounds a week, which is near Two Hundred Thousand
pounds a year, and in fourteen or fifteen years

then formerly. Is this then the mighty Service done by the
Late Ministry for the Publick? if they had saved for the
Nation one hundred thousand pounds out of the allowance for
the Civil List, as the Queen hath done, they might have
boasted of it;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were so far from saving any thing, that
whatever was allowed for the Expences of the Kings Household,
they generally expended a great deal more: Nay when
Seaven hundred thousand pounds was allowed for the Civil List,
they had some times Eight, and sometimes Nine hundred
thousand pounds for those uses, besides all the other
misapplications mentioned by the Commons;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I understand their Frugality and good
Management very well, the publick Aids and the standing Revenue
of the Crown, were it seems by the Kings directions and consent
to be applyed promiscuously for the Service of the publick,
but Liberal estimates being made by the Ministers for the
Occasions of the Civil List, and agreed to in Parliament they
still took more than was allowed; And the overplus that was
not misapplyed, must now be attributed to the good
Management of the said Ministers;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this the way of it? hold, let me see, I have   
the
Address of the C--ns in my pocket give me leave to read
one Paragraph; <font>'And we humbly crave leave farther to represent
to your Majesty, That tho' your Commons (who were always
ready to support the Dignity of the Crown) had amply provided
all those Sums (which according to the Largest Estimates laid
before them) were thought necessary for the occasions of the Civil
List, yet over and above the said sums and out of the Aides given
by Parliament, which by the Law of</font> England <font>are appropriated,
and ought to have been employed to the Common profit of the whole
Realm) many Large sums of Mony during the time of such
heavy Taxes upon the people, have been diverted under the head of
Secret Service, and for Salaries, Bounties, and Pensions, to
private Persons, which (if proper to be paid at all) ought to have
been Supplied out of the Civil List; Nay to so great a degree
did this profuseness extend, that several thousand pounds were
paid out of the publick Aids, to purchase great places for the Late
Earl of</font> Sunderland, <font>and the present Earl of</font> Albermarle, <font>so
little could your Commons depend upon the integrity of the publick
Officers, so little regard was had by them to these heavy Taxes
the people Lay under. That nothing less could secure the publick
Mony from misapplications then an express clause of appropriation;
which tho' not at all necessary for the Security of the publick
Mony in general, but only to direct the application of it in some
<pagebreak id="14" />
particular cases, yet whenever your Commons made no such particular
appropriation, they seldom failed to misapply the publick Mony;
which has been another great Cause of the heavy debt that Lies
upon the Nation</font> ; This it seems, is the Clause that is now to
be evaded by a Calculation how much Issu'd out of the
Excise, Custom, and other Branches of the Civil List, to the use
of the War during the Late Reign.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's fine indeed, what matter which way it
issued, since it was agreed that the late King should have a
rent Charge out of the whole for his own occasions? and
that the overpluss should go to the Service of the War?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None at all, for when the Money for the Civil List
was first paid and satisfied, the Publick must take the
overpluss for the Service of the War, where they could get it,
is this then any answer to the Representation of the
Commons?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No surely, but you may guess by these sort of
Answers, who takes most care to make right
Representations to the People, but do you observe what frequent
occasions are taken to applaud the Actions of the A--r of
the R--pt?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Yes, it is plain enough, we poor Freeholders 
are
not so silly as the great Men think us, we can see thorough
these Cobweb Politicks well enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay but pray Neighbour do him Justice, he has
done more then any of his Predecessors, ever did before
him, he takes care of the Cash every day and Locks it up
in a Chest with three Locks and Keys (which was never
done before.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish he has not lock'd it up so fast, that it   
will never
come all out again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray observe the true state of this Case. He       
solicited
a Bill when he sat in the House of Commons, to regulate
others, and boasted then of his great service therein, and now
he wont be regulated by it himself, but if he performs any one
direction of that Act, and breaks all the rest, he draws an
Encomium of himself beyond all comparison; this Act was made
<font>for the better observation of the Course Anciently used in the</font>
Exchequer. The King, Lords, and Commons take upon
them to say what was the Ancient Course, and this Noble
L--d was the promoter of that Interpretation; and amongst
other things this Act directs, <font>that all the Money in the said      
Reciept
shall be kept in Chests under three different Locks, and three Keys,
the Teller to have one, the Clerk of the Pells one, and the Eldest
Deputy Chamberlain the Third</font> ; and it farther directs <font>that the
<pagebreak id="15" />
Auditor of the Receipt shall Transmit the Imprest Rolls half Yearly  
to
the Queens remembrancer, in order to the charging or prosecuting of
Accountants, and shall half Yearly transmit to the Treasury the
Declaration of the Receipts issues and remains at the Exchequer, and
examine the Tellars Vouchers every three Months</font> ; these are the
Directions of the Statute, and the said Officer has Lock'd up
the Cash, but has done nothing else as the Act directs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is very fine indeed, the A--r has done his   
Duty
in one point, therefore he has done it in all the rest, is this the
Logick used amonst all the publick Officers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shoop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay but observe how this is expressed by some
persons; the <font>A--r has been more then ordinary carefull, &amp;c. and
thinking this to be too great a Sum to be entrusted with the Tellars,
has made a new Regulation in this particular</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is remarkable indeed; as if it was not the   
<font>Law</font>
but the A-r had made this new Regulation; <font> <foreign>O rara avis</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was not convenient to give too much credit to  
that
Statute, for except this Clause about the Money, it is aver'd
that the rest of the Act is mistaken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, that's fine indeed, to aver against a Record,
against an Act of Parliament, against King, Lords, and
Commons, and tell them they are all mistaken; the Act declares
what is the duty of the A--r, and also the Clerk of the
Pells, and in setting forth the same, affirms that the A--r
shall transmit the Imprest Rolls to the Remembrancer, and
not one word of any such thing to be done by the Clerk of the
Pells, and yet others say, that the Act is mistaken; the Clerk
of the Pells must do it, and not the A--r.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Act is mistaken, that's a jest, then there is 
an end
of all Laws at once; that's an Answer will serve to cover all
evil actions whatsoever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why may not the same persons that Stock-Job the
Publick Money into their own Pockets, expound away the
Statutes into wast Paper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of what use then are these general words in the   
Act,
<font>All which shall be done according the Ancient Course of the</font>
Exchequer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The meaning of these words were to keep up the
Course of the <font>Exchequer</font> in all other matters, not Enumerated in
the Act, as that the Imprest Rolls shall be Sign'd and Indorsed
by the A--r as usual, that the Clerk of the Pells shall have
the usual time of 30 days to examine the same, and that he
shall also Sign and Endorse the same, <font>&amp;c.</font> according to the
Ancient course of the <font>Exchequer</font> ; but these general words were
not to contradict the Special words before; for that is contrary
<pagebreak id="16" />
to express Maxims in the Law, for the Interpretation of all
Statutes whatsoever that where there is a General and Special
Clause in one Act, the Spicial Clause shall Govern the
General one; but the contrary would be a contradiction, and destroy
the Act, <font> <foreign>&amp; maledicta est expositio quae corrumpit textum</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you are told it is not practacible to account  
by
these Rolls.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The act says otherwise, but if the Rolls are not   
made
up as they ought, whose fault is that, shall we be allowed to
excuse fault by another?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thats too Common a thing in this Age; but as to
the processes against accountants, its said, that it would be
Vexatious to issue them out in Course;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Process ought to issue of Course, and on an
application, the Treasury may respite the same and give a
reasonable time, and such proceedings would make Officers follow
their accounts and get them passed, for want whereof, the
accounts are so very far behind;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is a World of Excuses made beforehand, but
what are they to the purpose? Let the Law judge of
these matters, if the party is innocent, Let it appear on
his Tryal, and that is the best way to clear his
reputation, and not to banter the Nation at this rate;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But as to the examining the Tellars Vouchers, they
say the Act was mistaken again, for who can tell whether a
Voucher be Legal or not; and to what purpose then is that
Law made?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what purpose indeed? For tho' no man can be
certain whether a voucher be forged or not, yet he may guess
even at that, and he can tell when he sees an acquittance
Signed with the name of the proper Party who was to receive
the Money, and Witnessed by an Officer, which would be
very much for the Publick Safety; for what Officer would
venture to be guilty of Forgery and forfeit his Office? And I
am sure for want of this examination a great Sum of Money
has been lost in the <font>Exchequer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this the way of it, When a man has made a
breach of the Law, instead of Arraigning the Offender, he
Arraigns the Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, and Arraigns a Law obtained by his own
Solicitation, but thus it is, the Law and the Commissioners must
bear all the blame, for the A--r is above all Law
and Com--ns whatsoever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And above Parliament too, for the poor Commons
shall neither have Remedy in Parliament nor out of
<pagebreak id="17" />
Parliament, if some can hinder it, Ee'n let them take all at
this rate;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The only way to preserve any Government,
especially in time of War and publick dangers, is a strickt
observation of <font>Rewards and Punishments</font> , but if honest men must
suffer and there be no way to punish great Offenders, then
farewell all indeed;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But of all the contrivances to run the Nation in  
debt,
there was none like the project of <font>Exchequer</font> bills; which (as
I am Credibly informed) served a great many evil purposes
at one and the same time, for they had thereby an
opportunity of obliging several Members of Parliament with good
offices, by evading the Law, <font>which said that no Members of
Parliament should be concerned in the management of any Aid to
be granted by Parliament, least they shoald grant more then was
necessary, in order to have a share for themselves</font> ; Then they had
an opportunity to oblige their friends by letting them have a
considerable interest for subscribing to the Circulation of them,
without paying in all their principal Money, and they had an
opportunity to gain great Sums for interest Mony to themselves
(tho subscribed in other Persons names) without paying in
any principal at all; and after all this they let the said Bills
run at a great discount of 15, 20, 25, and 30 <font>l. per Cent</font> loss   
to
the publick, that they might buy them up at a low rate, and
pay their Debts with them at parr to the Crown; and thus
the Nation has been used, and the publick Money Stock-job'd
away into private mens Pockets;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were a long time before we could find out the
mystery of this project. But I hope that Debt will be
discharg'd next Sessions, for it is a great Clog upon all the
publick Revenue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is so, and you would do well to make a more
effectual Law next Sessions, for the better regulating the method
of passing the publick Accounts of the Navy, Army, <font>&amp;c.</font> and
for compelling the Accountants to prosecute and pass their
Accounts, for we shall never get out of Debt whilst the
publick accounts are so far behind and unpass'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see but little hopes of having many good
Laws, till there is a better understanding between the two
Houses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, how did those misunderstandings first
begin, who made the first false step, the L--ds or
C--ns?
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those unhappy misunderstandings first began upon
the Impeachments of the L--ds; but who made the first false
Step I will not determine: I presume you have read the
Vindication of the Commons. I think that worthy Author
hath writ very plainly and very honestly upan that Subject,
and I do not remember that I have met with any book that
has fairly answered him;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I agree with that worthy Member, in most things, but
not in all, however I wish he would apply his thoughts how
to reconcile these Differences; That would be a noble
undertaking, and becoming his Character, for it is much easier
to find out a fault, then to find out a remedy for it, and we
are not now so much concerned to know who was in fault, as how
both Houses may be reconciled for the publick good;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say well Sir, That is the main concern, what is
past cannot be helped, we must not now look backwards, but
forwards, I believe the L--ds themselves do think they were
a little too hasty in that matter to go to Trial and
Judgment of acquittal in so many Impeachments, the very same
Sessions, without the petition or assent of the C--ns, and to
let men sit as Judges for one another in their own Cases;
No History, no Record from the foundation of the English
Government can give one other instance of such a
proceeding; but we must remember that the Commons have been
as faulty formerly in another particular, when they Voted
the Lords useless; and therefore I think it will do well if they
set one failing against the other, and so shake hands again for
the publick good;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Divines and the Lawyers agree together
in the same opinion, we may have some hopes; but the
matter of the impeachments is past, and in a manner forgot,
therefore there must be something else that occasions these
misunderstandings at this time a day;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The matter of the impeachments will never be
forgot whilst <font>England</font> remains, but there is some thing else
indeed that causes fresh misunderstandings, for it is easie to start
new points, however I beleive an Act of Indemnity would
reconcile us all;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An Act of Indemnity! I do not know what you mean,
I cannot understand how that would tend to a reconciliation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Guilty Conscience is always full of Fears and
Jealousies, and some men will never think themselves safe,
unless they are sheltred by an Act of Oblivion, or by keeping
up a misunderstanding between the two Houses;
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I understand you, truly I am afraid you have
hit upon the true Cause of all our differences.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But how is it possible that two or three persons can
be able to influence a Majority of so great a body of men of
Honor and Principles, and who can have no other thing so
much at their heart, as the Common good of their Native
Country;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The L--ds are naturally Jealous of their Rights and
Priviledges, as well as the C--ns, and any Members that will
stand up as Champions for the Rights and Prerogatives (as
some now call them) of that Noble House, will be sure to
get into esteem amongst them: and if they be men of parts
and speaking Members, they become at last, to be great
Men in the House, and to gain the Ascendant; and such men
will never want Numbers to support them; it is the
Common failing of both Houses, to be a little too much
Influenced by particular Persons, who are therefore commonly
known by the name of <font>Leading-men</font> , because by their Oratory,
by their plausible Arguments, and by their Established
influence, they <font>Lead</font> , and some times <font>Mislead</font> , very Honorable
Members into their Opinion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope Master you are none of those <font>Leading or
mislead Members, that are for Setting up Prerogatives in either
House</font> : I know of no <font>Prerogatives</font> but what are in the Crown,
and if you can both keep the Priviledges that belong to you,
it is well enough; I had rather be Governed by one Tyrant
if I were to chuse, then by a Multitude of them; but God
be praised, we have now as good a Government, as our
hearts can wish, and I hope you'll neither Lead, nor be
Mislead to change it for any other, for in Troth, if I thought
you would, you must excuse me as poor as I am, i'll never
Complement away my Free-hold to a Leading-Member.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art an honest Fellow, and a true              
<font>English-man</font> ,
no honest <font>Jack</font> , I am entirely of thy opinion, <font>for preserving
the Establisht Government, and the Established Succession, in the
Protestant Line</font> , and I am one of those in the House of
Commons, they call the <font>Flying Camp</font> , sometimes on this side,
sometimes on the other, as the Justice of the Cause leads me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I'll Fly to your Election as long as I Live; I
am but a poor man and of a mean Capacity, and therefore
I'll be glad to be advised, and to hear every mans opinion,
but I am resolved to follow my own poor Judgment at last, and
not to be led by the Nose blindfold.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art an Honest heart I'll warrant, <font>he who    
doth any
thing without hearing both Parties, or without Acting according to
his own Judgment, tho' the thing be ever so just, yet he cannot be
said to be a just man</font> , I wish all our Senators of both Houses were
of thy mind; but what will you say, if men resolve to stand
by one another right or wrong, and in a manner Subscribe
their names to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they that do so, ought to have but one    
Vote
amongst them all, for if Twenty Souls be as it were glew'd
together by Combination, they are in effect but one Soul, and
therefore ought to have but one Vote in Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast certainly pass'd a very good Sentence,   
if it
were possible to be put in Execution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But pray Sir, what is it that can possibly give   
any men
an opportunity at this time to create any differences amongst
us, we have certainly <font>the best Queen in the World, she is a right
English-Woman, and loves her People with all her Heart</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She does so, and if you did but know what pains she
takes in Council every day, you would wonder; she spends all
her time in taking care of her People, she is always consulting
how to preserve them, or praying for a blessing upon her
Endeavours for their good; she Scarce affords her self time
for necessary Refreshment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Nation is happy, I warrant, there are few     
Ladies
about her, would take so much pains to be Queen in her
Place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have stood amaz'd to see with what Patience she
attends in Council to hear Causes and Complaints, to redress
Greivances and Consult with them for the Common Safety.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is an excellent Princess indeed, and has not    
only
care of the outward happiness of her People, but like a true
Parent of her Country, she thinks her self concerned also
to take care of their Souls; Witness her several
Proclamations for Encouragement of Piety and Vertue, and for the
Discouragement of Vice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We had abundance of such Proclamations in former
Reigns, but it was then a general observation, that about the
same time, some very Lew'd and Debauch'd men were
preferr'd, and advanced at Court, that made all the rest look
a little like a Banter; pray Sir, can you tell me any
Nobleman that hath been Advanced or taken Notice of on
account of his Virtue, for that once known would be the
best Proclamation to promote Piety and Virtue                        
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: virtne</comment> .
<pagebreak id="21" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have no very great acquaintance amongst the
Nobility, I believe there are many, but I know one Noble Lord
lately Advanced, that is a man of Piety and Virtue, and I
doubt not, will always maintain that Character.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish I could hear his Name, for I would         
Endeavor
to get his Custom, Prompt payment is a brave thing amongst
us Tradesmen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sorry I cannot oblige you with his name,
without asking him leave, I am afraid he meets with many
discouragements already, but if he were named, he wou'd
be the standing mark for all the Debauchees in the Town
to let fly their Randome Shot at; truly I believe there
are many Virtuous and Religious Noblemen who conceal
themselves in this Wicked Age for that very reason;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, if you know one Good man, I can tell you ten
bad, that have got into places, notwithstanding these
Proclamations;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, do you think that the Queen can know mens
hearts, do you think that she is personally acquainted with
her Officers; all Kings and Queens are forced to hear with
other persons Ears, and see with other persons Eyes, and so
are their Ministers too, therefore we must not wonder, that
in all Reigns, more bad then good men are preferred;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The reason of that is plain, for they get the      
places
that Solicite and make the most Friends; but good men are
Modest and never seek for them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you will not loose a good Place for the     
sake of your
Modesty, or for want of asking; but we that have no other Aim
but the good of our Country, do not complain of any preferments
whatsoever, it is indifferent to us who have the places, so they
are well managed for the Service of the Queen and Country;
if they are good men so much the better; if they are bad,
perhaps the Example of such a Queen may reform them, if
they do well, we are contented, if they do ill they must be
contented to hear of it from us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But it vexes me to see men of no merit, men that   
have
formerly railed at this Court, men that are Enemies to the
Established Government, both in Church and State, intrusted
with the Administration of Publick Affairs in this happy Reign.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must be content to let some weeds grow up
together with the Corn, neither the Queen, nor her Ministers, have
had much time yet to look about them; they are Buisy on the
Grand Affairs of <font>Europe</font> , how to preserve our Religion, our
Liberties, and our Properties, from a Foreign Enemy; but they'll
<pagebreak id="22" />
find you out at last, and then we shall hear no more
complaints.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank you Sir, for your Reprimand: I confess it  
do's
not become a Man of my profession to be speaking of these
matters, for it naturally raises a Jealousy; and I am afraid
there are too many that hunt after faults and 
Male-Administration, and make great complaints of this nature, when  
they
really are angry at nothing, but that they are not preferr'd
themselves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly Sir, I am always Jealous of any man that is
very violent in these matters; let us have a little patience, and
I doubt not as fast as ill men are found out, good men will come
into their places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Bill of Conformity will help the Queen, and  
her
Ministers to know men; but pray Sir, who are our great
Officers in all the high stations?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast a mind to be a States-man, I am afraid you
will be as great a Politician as your Ploughman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In troth Master, since I am got into so good      
Company,
I would willingly learn as much as I can, that I may baffle my
Ploughman, and keep him close to his Work, and if I could learn
so much as to free my Neighbours from fears and jealousies,
and settle their heads to their Husbandry; I believe you'd
have your Rents better paid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed you wou'd Master; pray give him a little
Instructions, for he is a leading Member in our Parish, I assure
you, and makes a great Figure at a Quarter-Sessions,
he is generally Foreman of the Grand-Jury, and will baffle a
Whigg Justice very handsomely.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee leave of thy Old distinctions of Whigg and
Tory, I know no distinction but one, and that is between an
Honest Man and a Knave, between those who love their Queen
and their Countrey, and those who do not, between those who
are for the Established Government in Church and State,
and those who are against it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right Master, I know no other neither, but when I  
dare
not venture to call a man <font>Knave</font> , least he should break my
head, yet I can say he is a <font>Whigg</font> without danger, and that is
the same thing in my understanding; but I confess we often
mistake, and call an Honest Man a Knave, and a Knave an
Honest Man, and so I doubt we do not always apply the Name
of Whigg and Tory as it ought to be; but pray excuse my
rudeness, and do not deny my good Friend a little
Information.
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not need much entreaty in this matter, for I
would have all the Freeholders of <font>England</font> know what great
care is taken for their common safety and wellfare in this
particular, and first you have <font>his Royal Higness the Prince of</font>   
Danemark
<font>High-Admiral of</font> England, <font>and Generalissimo of all her Majesty's
Forces by Sea and Land, a Prince whose Character can never be
sufficiently extolled for Sincerity to the true Interest of</font>        
England, <font>for
steddiness in his Councils, for his care of our Trade and Navigation,
for his easiness of Access, and readiness to hear all Parties</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is a Prince of an extraordinary disposition      
indeed,
but among all his other good Characters, pray don't forget his
ready submission to the will of his late Sovereign, his constant,
and I may now say dutiful affection to the Queen, his former
tenderness of his Children, and great condescention and
kindness to all his Servants.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a certain sign of good Principles, as well 
as of a
good Disposition, but since you are for recollecting my memory,
give me leave to recollect yours too, and to entreat you not to
forget his Conformity with the Establish'd Government, both
in Church and State, for tho' as a Foreign Prince, he was bred up
in a National Church abroad, that differs in Ceremonies from
ours; yet he has order'd the Lyturgy of the Church of
<font>England</font> to be Translated into the <font>Danish</font> , or <font>High Dutch</font> 
Language
which he best understands, and so by using the same, hath
given a noble and Princely example of a Christian and Dutiful
submission to the Establish'd Government, in order to comply with
the Laws of the Land, and preserve the Unity of the Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Di.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was a noble Compliance indeed, and I pray God
his Princely example may have the good effect, that may
reasonably be expected from it, we should then be a happy
Nation, and entirely United among our selves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, how comes it to pass that some Men do
complain of this Prince's Bill; certainly the Husband of a Queen
ought to have a great deal more than the Wife of a King,
besides the possibility of surviving was very remote, and the
Advantage of obliging him was very great.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One reason is, because he is good; for you never   
knew
Wicked Men love a good Man in your life; and some persons
are pleas'd to fancy what I believe they'll find themselves very
much mistaken in; that by such proceedings they make Court
to the Successor, but that wise Princess well knows, that they
who are ready to support one Prince will be ready to support
another; and what the People give out of the Civil List, they
can easily supply to the Crown another way, if ever there be
an occasion for it; which there is great odds there never will;
<pagebreak id="24" />
and she also knows that such sorts of Complements are more
for hopes of preferment to themselves, than any real kindness
to the Successor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Question of it, but I am very well contented to
bear my share of the Prince's Bill, if it ever takes effect; I
don't doubt but he will deserve a great deal more from the
Nation; but I perceive he is so good a man at Home, the Queen
cannot spare him abroad. Pray what kind of man have you to
be Admiral at Sea?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have Sir <font>G. R.</font> a man of undoubted Courage   
and
Conduct, Loyal to his Queen, Zealous for the Interest of his
Country, a true Lover of the Seamen, and heartily belov'd
by them, and all that know him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I have seen some scurvey papers against him;
as if he had taken French Money;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, Ha, he has taken some, that is certain, and has
endeavoured to take a great deal more, if he could have got
at it, but the Bird was flown;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, you mean at <font>Vigo</font> , that was a lucky hit    
for him,
for his friends the Whiggs had a rod in pickle for him, if that
Job had not prevented;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Law.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, that Job did not save him neither, for he was
under as strict an examination as he could have been, if that
had never happened; but such was his Integrity and Conduct,
that even the L--ds bestowed a Vote of Commendation upon
him;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure the C--ns unanimously Voted the thanks
of their House to him, for his great and signal Service              
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Servics</comment> to
the Nation, which he received with the presence of an
Admiral, and returned with the Language of an Orator;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What an Admiral, and an Orator, a man of Courage
and of Conduct too, Loyal to his Queen, true to his
Country? Nay then, so far we are Safe, now for our Armies
abroad, who is General there this Summer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You know well enough, the same as the last, only
his Loyalty to the Queen, and great Services to his Country
have been the meanes to advance him from Earl, to a
higher Title of Duke of <font>M.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like that way of Rewarding great men very well,
for it pleases them, and Costs us nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Free.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am for rewarding publick Services every way, I
know by my little Affairs in the Country, that Frugality in
such cases, is no better than Folly.
