<nonSpeech>St. James's Park, <font>Nine in the Morning</font> .</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech>Bellamar <font>and</font> Marlove <font>meet</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bellamar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good-Morrow, Madam; the Sun
and you are up Betimes to Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Marlove.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; but we did not
go to Bed together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, or he had not rose so
soon. But pray now was you any where late last Night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Worthy's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He in Town, and I not know it!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You was not to be found. Had you come, you'd
been in Love with Matrimony, to have seen a Man of
Sense so happy in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Excuse me; 'twould rather have frightn'd me, to
have seen it able to impose upon the best Understanding.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He talks prodigiously of the <font>how much</font> he owes to
both our Friendships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I owe more to your Friendship than he does, but
must show my Gratitude in Silence. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kisses her Hand.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray, does the Lady seem as much oblig'd as he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis hard to tell. You know that Fop <font>Alamode</font>
had made great Impressions; and nothing is so difficult to
get rid of as a Fool.
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Except the Passion fair Ladies have for keeping
'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's civil. -- But <font>Moderna</font> I fear will grow
impatient. I've made her wait this Hour. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, Madam! I'd forgot. -- Is <font>Florinda</font> come 
with her Brother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that all you stopt me for. She is. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Goes,   
but returns</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray, Mr. <font>Bellamar</font> , How come you to enquire after
<font>Florinda</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Only to know, if after her late Illness, she's as
handsome as she was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To other People she is: But I believe she won't
seem so to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why d'think so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because she is the same. And that is what has
no Charms for you, I know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In any Body but you, I hope you mean, 
Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Matter what you hope, my Meaning is as
easily understood as yours, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wou'd always have my Meaning plain, Madam,
that I might ever appear your Humble Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And her Slave.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you Dream?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I am awake: Mine are Visions all. Come,
come! Throw off the Mask. D'think I have forgot,
when she was last in Town, how with an affected
Negligence you Courted her, as Life; told her her Faults only
to be thought sincere, when e'er you spoke your Love, and
prais'd her Virtues; thou poor Dissembler!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall reform me then: I will dissemble no     
longer,
since it displeases you. Pray, Madam, have you lately
heard from Mr. -- him, who won a Thousand
Pounds at <font>Pickett</font> of you, and generously forgave the
Debt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Insulting Monster! To reproach me with what
Necessity, Confusion, and Surprize subdu'd me too; when
Love and Choice resign'd me up to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Love resign'd to me no more than your Want
did to him. And I'm not Casuist enough to decide which
is best, between Two Things that generally produce the
same Effect.
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then there is no deciding which is worse, the
Devil or you. Since Ingratitude and Mischief, Falshood
and Ruin, proceed alike from both, thou Faithless, Base,
Perfidious Man. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Marlove.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou very very -- true Woman!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Solus.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I begin to wish I'd had no 
Hand in this
Marriage; but he forc'd me to use my Interest with
<font>Marlove</font> , to influence <font>Moderna</font> ; 'twas never my Judgment:
But here he is.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Worthy.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Bellamar</font> , welcome, welcome to the Man that
owes his Peace and Happiness to you; say, how can my
Gratitude repay the Joy you gave me with <font>Moderna</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, just the Way you do, by being happy with
her. Believe me, Friend, I am as glad to see thee pleas'd,
as Knaves wou'd be to have thee griev'd. -- I need not
ask how your Wife does, since your Joys seem without
Allay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are indeed, <font>Bellamar</font> . And -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, I guess what you would say; Rapturous Love,
<font>Elizium</font> Fields, and all the Joys that Poets ever dream'd of,
are much surpass'd by yours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Bellamar</font> , thou art in the Right; I am happier 
if
possible than thou hast spoken; and what's impossible to
her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's hard to say. In the mean Time, Is it
possible for you to tell me where you was a-going.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No farther, now I've met you; though I had a 
Compliment this Morning from my Rival <font>Alamode</font> , to tell
me, even the Plague, much less the Summer, cou'd not
empty <font>London</font> , whilst my Wife and I were here. --
What do you think of visiting him? His Lodgings are hard
by. 'Twill amuse an idle Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should readily consent, if I was not sure he had
a Thousand idle Ones to be reveng'd on us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You continue still most implacable to him, and
poor <font>Lurcher</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because they are most monstrously Incorrigible. -- 
The Foppery of <font>Alamode</font> puts one out of Countenance
Ten Times a Day. You are as dear to him one Moment
as his own Affectations; and the next, he's as great a 
<pagebreak id="4" />
Stranger to you as to true Sense or good Breeding: Then his
Conversation is a perpetual War with Words, which the
Ladies and their Favourites not understanding, admire for
Wit. In short, he's a meer Perspective, pleases at a
Distance, but when you are near, you'll find the Colours are
upon an insensible Wall. -- However, if you've
a Mind, I'll go, though Fifty to One he'll not be at 
Home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shou'd have thought for that very Reason, you
wou'd have gone. But how come you to fancy a Man of
his Fashion shou'd be Abroad so early?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such a one would be most likely, for want of
Entertainment at Home, and a Desire to trouble other People:
But I have another Reason to think so; the Coxcomb, ever
fertile in Foppery, has taken lately into his Head a Fancy
of changing his Name, and seeing none on certain Days,
but some particular People. I luckily call'd one of those
Times, and his Servants told me that his Master went by
the Name of <font> <foreign>Le bel Esprit</foreign> </font> , and that Day saw none but 
Courtiers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was in the right, or he would have got a new
Name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought so, and forgave all his other Follies for
the Sake of this one, since it hinder'd my seeing him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is strangely absurd, and wou'd seem monstrous
even upon the Stage, where 'tis lawful to represent Figures
larger than the Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In my Opinion the Poets have no great Obligation
to Mankind for that Liberty; 'tis no more than granting
them what's impossible: I've seen more Gigantick Fools
upon the Theatre of the World, than were ever shewn at
the <font>Theatre-Royal</font> -- What do you think of a 
Coxcomb walking over an intimate Acquaintance of Six Foot
High, and bowing to a Dwarf with a Nick-Name, at the
further end of a Gallery; and then excusing himself to the
Man he trod upon, by saying he did not see him? There
is another Species not unlike these Things, who look as
saucily upon you when they are in Power, as on their
Footmen when they ask their Wages; and the Moment
they are turn'd out, ready to go of your Errand, and
professing Friendship to a Doorkeeper: Is not this as
prodigious as a Man's changing his Name? Death!
changing one's Nature, or having no Nature at all,
<pagebreak id="5" />
is being more a <font>Caliban</font> than ever Fiction dream'd
on -- Wretches without Honour or Sense!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must confess this in Honour to their Sense,
they all suspect one another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you must allow, in Reproach to it, they all
trust one another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Satyr turns extreamly upon great Men;
'tis lucky for the Crowd, they pass by uncensur'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because little Villains are meer <font>Irish</font>        
Vermin, carry
no Venom in 'em; but the Crimes of Great Men, like
the poisonous Serpents, conceal Destruction under their
exterior Lustre: Their Examples are so many
Commands to the inferior World, and the heedless Herd
are caught as Apes and Monkeys are, by an ignorant
Admiration and Propensity to mimick those who only make
Slaves and Jests of 'em -- But does your
Indulgence for an Ass continue still? Won't this Fop cure you of
your Charity for the Fool <font>Lurcher</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing can cure me of the Value I have for his
Truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: Believing him will; I'll answer for it, the
Rogue is as unsincere as a First Minister, and would lie
as fast, if he had Language enough to be Intelligible;
but want of that makes all he says neither true nor false;
for Giberidge cannot properly be called either.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, Fie; <font>Lurcher</font> is a well natur'd honest     
Fellow;
and let me tell you, good Nature and Complaisance will
attone for the want of infinite good Qualities, that are
requisite to excuse the Defect of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pox of his Complaisance and good Nature; 'tis
the Effect of Idleness, and want of Inclinations of his
own: Then for being honest, 'tis Fear keeps him
so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, you must allow him Courage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. If you'll try it as you do Gold, by the
<font>Weight</font> , he'll turn the Scale against <font>Alexander</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's a surer way of trying Gold, by Fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which to my Knowledge he can't stand on a
Training Day. I've seen him start and look Pale at a Squib at
my Lord-Mayor's Show.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Involuntary Motions -- <font>Caesar</font> , we are told,
would often faint.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay. But <font>Caesar</font> was a Lion when he came to
himself; and then 'tis the other's most an Ass. To be sincere,
I hate this Fool worse than <font>Alamode</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, you're too severe upon poor <font>Lurcher</font> , in
preferring <font>Alamode</font> to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I differ with you; I can forgive a Coxcomb sooner
than a Fool. Fops are like those Insects that fly about in
hot Weather, rather troublesome than hurtful: Creatures
that in common Justice must be annihilated, for they have
not Virtues enough to save 'em, nor Vices enough to damn
'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I always thought Coxcombs less pardonable than
Fools, because their Faults are generally of their own
acquiring, and the others impos'd by Nature.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So is the Cruelty of Tygers, Wolves, and
Mountain Cats, natural too, and therefore in my Opinion the
more to be fear'd, by as much as 'tis harder to change
Nature than reform Custom. As to the Coxcomb, amuse
'em with Women; take all the Letters they receive from
their Creditors for <font> <foreign>Billet-Deux</foreign> </font> ; Give 'em Ribbons,
Essence, fine Cloaths and Flattery, and you may sooth the
harmless Things into doing any Good that does not
interrupt their Folly. But a Fool is a very <font>English</font> Bull-dog,
you may injure, but can't oblige him; they are despis'd as
Dull and Little, and Men never know their Strength and
Activity, till they feel it at their Throats.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Coxcombs have a flower, but full as sure a way
of killing, by torturing of your Ears; though I 
confess bad is the best. But I've forgot, How does my friend
<font>Townly</font> ? He's no Fool, I hope.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; but he makes a great many by passing upon
them for a Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Poh. He cou'd not do that if he had not Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pardon me; 'tis but resolving, and by the help
of Party, you may have a good Character as easy as a 
bad one: You're a Patriot at St. <font>James's</font> Coffee-House,
and a Rebel at the <font>Cocoa-Tree</font> ; Fool in one Company,
and a Philosopher in another. But don't imagine from
this, that I think he wants plain Sense and
Honesty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, an useful Understanding passes most current
in the World.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay: As Farthings do in a Market, they're the
ready Change for Things of least Value there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I grant you, Wit, like Painting, is valuable, as
it entertains us; but whoever gazes all his Time
away <font>upon Pictures, or spends it on the other</font> , will be left
Naked, Dry and Hungry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad Wit has any Thing in common with
Virtue. But in the Pleasure of meeting you, I forgot a 
little Business I had to do. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pulls out his Watch.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall I see you at Dinner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most certainly. I intended if I had not met 
you.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exeunt severally.</font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Scene changes to</font> Worthy's <font>Lodging</font> .</nonSpeech> 

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Moderna <font>and</font> Marlove.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Moderna.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear <font>Marlove</font> ! What has kept you so long?
I waited for you as impatiently as the Country
Ladies do for the Assizes or a Horse-Race; you must
expect for the first Month nothing but rural
Similies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Marlove.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the first Month? For your whole Life, 
I hope; since I would always have you bring your Images
from the Seat of Innocence and Quiet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Yes! they're as innocent as <font>Adam</font> and <font>Eve</font>
without their Aprons: But then, believe me, they're as
ignorant too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad to find neither Marriage, nor the
Country, have been able to spoil thy Gaiety. You stand a little
indebted to me; for sure, had you had that Creature of
some Twenty several Shops, that Fop <font>Alamode</font> , you wou'd
have been a miserable Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps not. -- I can't tell whether 'twould
not have been better if I had Married him, for
then Fifty to One I should have dislik'd him by this 
Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And don't you, as it is?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What if I did not?
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you didn't, I should think you in the 
Green-Sickness, and pin'd for Trash, whilst the Luxurious <font>Autumn</font>
offer'd you his Luscious Store.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shu! 'tis but a lusty Surfeit, and one's well for
ever. -- Prithee, dear <font>Marlove</font> , -- Why so severe? You over-rul'd
my Inclinations in this Match: Besides, you know, Child, our
Affections are no more in our Choice than our natural
Complexions, therefore we are no more accountable for
loving a Fool, than liking an ill Face; we'll be judg'd by
my Sister.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Florinda.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

I was just defending the Cause of Fools; What is your
Opinion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That 'twas generously done, Madam, to defend
your greatest Enemies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pish -- But what do you seriously think, are they
really despicable or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in their own Opinions; I'll answer for 'em, or
they were not Fools.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Horrid! But answer me directly, is not a Fool as
entertaining as a Farce.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I grant you. But wou'd you, because a Farce
diverts you for half an Hour live with <font>Harlequin</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay! I vow she's in the Right on't. One goes
to see Monsters or the Tombs for Amusement; but I shou'd
be sorry to be lock'd up with them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because they can't talk to one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In that, I think 'em preferrable to Fools.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O fye, Sister! Never go about to persuade me,
that a living Fool has not more Merit with us, than the
Seven Wise Masters of <font>Greece</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knocking at the Door.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord! here's the more fashionable Drums and
Trumpets coming in the Name of Congratulatory Visits,
<font>Marlove</font> . Let us be gone.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exeunt</font> Flor. <font>and</font> Mar.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bellamar.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To give you Joy upon your Marriage, Madam, 
were needless. All I can wish you, is, May your 
Happiness know no Change.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For Heavens sake! Why, confine me? What if
I shou'd change my Inclinations?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, 'twoud be as unpardonable in you, as to
change your Face, since you must do both for the worse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But without changing one's Inclinations, one
might be as well Ugly as Handsome; as they who have no
Variety of Passions, may as well be Poor as Rich.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Alamode.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

Sir, your humble Servant!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Alam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, your Slave! You've left the Country
Desart in Spight of Spring, and Winter flourishes now you
are here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It does not seem so by your Shoes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Alam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shoes! What do you mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are not Dirty, that's all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! I never walk, but at Chapel, the 
Drawing-Room, or the House of Commons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought the Members sat at the House of 
Commons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Admirable! But 'tis cruel to rob me of a Pun:
You might as well disrobe me, Ha! I think that was well
enough.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Townly.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I'm extreamly glad to see you so well in
Health, and with a Husband!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm oblig'd to you, Sir. I'm happily possess'd of
both.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O dear <font>Townly</font> , I joy to see thee!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do! -- Gad, I met you just now, and
you did not know me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask Ten Thousand Pardons. I was thinking,
and did not see you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe the latter, because you trod upon me.
Prithee, What was you thinking on?
<pagebreak id="10" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Maid, whispers</font> Moderna.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, you'll excuse me. We all dine
together, I hope. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Moderna.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I was a Saying, What was your Thoughts
employ'd on?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why? -- A Criticism on one of Mr.
<font>Congreve's</font> Plays, where he exposes Men of Quality, by making
'em Fops and Fools.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard Judges say, he drew exactly after
Nature.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good, <font>Bellamar</font> ; very good. -- <font>Townly</font> , when
shall I hear thee say such a Thing? Thy Wit is like
a certain Friends of ours, who to be very sharp, bids you
kiss his A---, and laughs. You know him, <font>Bellamar</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, to have no Sharpness, but what he owes to
his Amours. And tho' his Satyr comes from his Mouth
like other Men's, 'tis not from his Brain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But his Stomach; sweetly intimating his Breath is
sowre. -- Sweet and Sowre. -- You know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive, <font>Alamode</font> is as well pleas'd with
<font>Antithesis</font> as Mr. <font>Bayes</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's as pleas'd with a Fool as Mr. <font>Bayes</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's that, <font>Alamode</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, as much as to say, <font>Townly</font> , I am very well
pleas'd when thee and I meet. Ha! <font>Bellamar.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A fair Hit. But I thought every Body knew a Jest
and you were inseparable; and that 'twas impossible to find
the one without the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm sure one can never find you without the
obliging'st Things in Nature. I'll tell you, <font>Bellamar</font> , a Pun
I made t'other Day: I was maintaining at <font>White's</font> , that the
<font>Czar's</font> Troops were the bravest Fellows in the World. Why
so, Sir? says the Brigadier. Why so, Sir, says I, the
Reason's plain, for they always Rush-on when they must go
fight: So I went Abroad and told it; and Folks made me
blush, by saying I had too much Wit.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Lurcher.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

O <font>Lurcher</font> , I'm sure thou art no Cheat!
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish he is not, for he looks like a Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing. But that they are too often Cheats.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cry you Mercy! that Turn escap'd me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Matter what I look like, I know what you
talk like.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee now, What?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, like one that hates ev'ry Body who have
not as much Wit as your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You wrong me, my Quarrel was only with those
who have so little, that their going upon Two Legs looks
like playing of Tricks. How long have we been Foes,
<font>Lurcher</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you, if you won't think me a Fool for
repeating his Words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, tell him, tho' he was the only Man I desir'd
you not to tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I am the only Man he ought to tell, for I
hope thou never spok'st well of me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you're grave, I'm dumb. -- 'Twas the
simplest Thing in the World: The Day we din'd last together,
<font>Bellamar</font> negligently went into the Room before <font>Lurcher</font> ,
sate upon his Right Hand at Table. -- And worst of all,
took the Glass of Wine he call'd for, and with it his
Stomach; for he cou'd not eat out of Anger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that all, I'm sorry for it, dear <font>Lurcher</font> : 
To
make thee amends, thou shalt go to Heaven before me, if
thou canst.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then, Are we Friends?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Entirely. What think you of a Turn in the Park
till Dinner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Agreed. -- I find we all dine together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you come, <font>Lurcher</font> , <font>Bellamar</font> will go 
into the Room before you, and take your Glass again.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exeunt all but</font> Lurcher.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Worthy</font> is my good Friend, I will stay and Dine,
for all them. -- Beside, I have a Design to ask him
for his rich Sister: I know he loves me; but then he loves
<font>Bellamar</font> better. I wish I cou'd make 'em fall out, then
shou'd I have her snug to my self.
<pagebreak id="12" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Marlove.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How comes this Fool to stumble on this frightful
Probability? I am alarm'd! And something must be
done, for shou'd it be a Match, <font>Bellamar</font> is lost! For his
Behaviour just now sufficiently confirmed me, if she gives
her Consent, his will not be wanting.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coming towards</font> Lurcher.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What's that you are resolving to try, <font>Lurcher</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To vex 'em that vex me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who are they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Matter. But mayhap I may fit 'em as well. 
Will you carry me up and introduce me to Mr. <font>Worthy's</font>  
Sister?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my Heart. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fools are often
lucky at guessing. -- I must improve this Hint, tho'
the Fancy of a Fool; for shou'd it be Real, I am lost.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you, <font>Florinda</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ladies, your Servant! -- I was just coming
up to you. This honest Gentleman, Madam, is a Friend
of your Husband's; and desires to be known to you and
your Sister.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Recommended by you, and my Husband's Friend,
are Merits will always make him welcome here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord! Madam, I am welcome where-ever I go.
All People love honest <font>Lurcher</font> : I am known every where
by the same Name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That proceeds from your being every where the
same Thing, I dare say, Sir.
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Madam; for I am the same I was the Hour I
was Born; never have any Thing to do, but to go to Plays
and Opera's, or where People ask me: 'Twould kill
another Man to do as I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, sure, for he would die first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> D'you think so; thank God I'm as healthy as a
Horse; pardon the Comparison.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Horse does, I do. But pray, Sir, Was you
never in Love? That wou'd try the Strength of your Heart,
more than all you have mentioned.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She likes me, I see -- She talks of Love,          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
-- Never but with a Cousin of my own, who is as like
me as ever she could Stare; just such a Face for all the
World, and such a Humour; every-body said we shou'd
have made a charming Couple; but she was my Second
Cousin; had she been my First, I might lawfully have
married her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is unlucky for the rest of Womankind -- You'll 
never love so truly again; our first Passion is ever the
sincerest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She's at it again. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so neither,
Madam; your Ladyship methinks is as like her in Person as any
Thing, only indeed you are not so facetious. Gemini, the
Jokes we used to crack upon our Neighbours, and upon one
another: I shall never forget one she made upon me at a
Christning; said she, I believe your Father and Mother
were both Maids when they were married; because when
Two Maidenheads meet they always get a Fool. Ha!
ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe by that your Cousin's Father and Mother
were not Maids when they married, for she was no
Fool.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How come you to know that? No more they were;
and that broke off the Match, for they say she was a 
Bastard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought, being your Relation made it
impossible.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so neither: For by paying so much Yearly
to the Poor, I was told the Spiritual Court would wink 
at it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This must break her Heart sure?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; that was too tough, as they say, but it did
turn her Brains.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then she was cured of her Passion, I suppose, 
Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Madam; I told you Truth, I never tell any
Thing else: Your Brother always said I was too honest to
live in this World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But happily you have another Quality, that always
thrives, though Honesty don't.

<nonSpeech>Worthy, Bellamar, <font>and</font> Lurcher, <font>as just risen from
Dinner</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I am not mightily mistaken, <font>Bellamar</font> , your
Inclinations are not different from mine; here is none
but my Friend, honest <font>Lurcher</font> ; I may speak freely of a 
Design I long have wish'd to execute, by binding of our
Friendships by the Name of Brother: Tell me; Do you
like my Sister well enough to say that seriously which you
have so often spoken to her in Gallantry?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like her, as one that has her Sexes Beauties with
her Brother's Mind; so well, that I conjure you by our
Friendship, put not the least Constraint upon her Actions:
Let her make me happy; or at least leave me the Pleasure
of reflecting I have not made her miserable.
<pagebreak id="15" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis generously answer'd. You have my Consent;
now gain her your own way. -- But shall we go in? The
Women talk'd of Tea.

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Marlove <font>hearkning</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis so; just as I expected, they are to be married
I find.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To be Married! then his Suspicions and my Fears
are true -- But stay, I'll hear more. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her Sexes Beauty with her Brother's Mind; those
were his Words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then Hell's blackest Falshood was in them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is in Love, I see -- But I may spoil his
Sport. If I could make him banish <font>Bellamar</font> his House --
For she seems to like me -- I'll try.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Leave that to me, <font>Lurcher</font> , for I've overheard 
all
you've been saying, and will join my Interest to advance
you in her Esteem; and for your Comfort, know
<font>Worthy's</font> Sister hates <font>Bellamar</font> : Yet further for your Hopes,
if you can keep a Secret, she is, I know, in Love with you.
Her Brother will, she tells me, this Day force her to marry
<font>Bellamar</font> , if some Means are not found out to avert the
Blow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d'you think of making <font>Worthy</font> jealous of
<font>Bellamar</font> with his Wife? -- If you'll tell me what to say,
-- I'll swear any Thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That won't do -- Her Passion lies so much another
Way; -- besides, he is so indifferent in his Behaviour, the
Malice will appear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know well enough who you mean, 'tis <font>Alamode</font> .
-- I saw him Whisper, and put a Note into her Hand
rising from Table, and went away immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I have a better Prospect -- But let us
be gone, -- they'll miss us else -- How quick to fear is
Guilt! -- Go wait for me at my House.

will always be in the Right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I am both, appears in nothing so much as
admiring you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Flattery, after one is married, is downright Abuse,
because we know 'tis Flattery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet 'tis then we want it most.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because we generally discover Faults that won't   
bear
Truth, which we conceal'd before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but the Disease is then grown desperate,
and Sleeping Draughts are best to quiet what's
incurable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm of your Opinion; and it shou'd go near to
quiet, if I prepar'd it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Monster! but tell me <font>Bellamar</font> , what wou'd you
say if a Woman shou'd endeavour to make a Fool of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, that she was inclined to love me, and so
endeavour'd to make me what was most agreeable to her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Wit, Sir, makes you forget here are
Women in the Room.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Madam -- 'tis the best Security against Envy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but 'tis not the best Security against Hatred,
<font>Bellamar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wonder it shou'dn't, -- 'tis the harmlessest    
Thing
upon Earth, it never infects any Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You're intolerable; I'm surpriz'd you escape.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you mean the Power of your Eyes, Madam, I
have not escap'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ridiculous Creature; I would rather hear you
rail than praise, because I'm sure you're sincere then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I'm Dumb, Madam; I say nothing.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I find myself in earnest, I'm as aukward as
Sir <font>Willfull Witwou'd</font> -- how near are Sincerity and
Dullness allied! full as near as strong Desire and
Impotence. I'm so Silly and so Serious, that I'm downright
Speechless -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wonder, Madam, where your
Brother is gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wou'd you have me go and inquire, Sir -- He
looks shamefully Guilty, and I'm glad to see it. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For God's sake, Madam; I only ask'd <font> <foreign>pour     
passer
le temps</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A most happy Expedient truly; but I interrupted
some Jest, I fear -- You seem to be in a most pleasant
Humour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's pardonable in you, Madam, who can
make such good ones of your own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm oblig'd to you, Sir, for that Power.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are, but 'tis sorely against my Will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shou'd be sorry to oppose your Will, whilst
you have that dying Look.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad you think me in so desperate a 
Condition,  you'll the easier believe what I say, since the
Words of even dying Criminals are seldom doubted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wou'd be glad to know what you have to
discover, that makes you so sollicitous to be believ'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truth of great Importance, that will, if I
recover, concern my Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But if you shou'd not recover, what wou'd you
leave me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have nothing I can call my own; you, like a 
bold Invader, have born away by force what else my
Faith and Love had offer'd.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what had my Brother's Visit to do with
this Speech? Why did you not at once open your 
Snuff-box, and then the Case?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, from not thinking well of myself, nor ill
enough of you, to ask you to resign the World for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tho' you pretend too much Modesty to ask it,
I'll be sworn you have Vanity enough to expect it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rather say, I've Love enough to wish it, and too
much, I fear, to be easy under a Disappointment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Love from you sounds like Religion from
Atheists, they never name it but in Ridicule or
Complaisance to the Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg you not to think -- because I laugh at the
<font>French</font> Prophets, I'm so insensible as to reject Truths
enforc'd by Miracles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but Women like a little of the Prophet, a
Man to win us must see Visions and dream Dreams till
he is quite out of his Senses, and then we'll believe him
sent by Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are to blame, your Interest is the same with
true Religion, a Man loves you the more for being in
his Senses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How comes it then all your Lovers in Romances
and Novels are raving?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, unless their Authors were so, I can't tell;
or if that was a Proof, as you pretend, it ought to be
a kind of Mortification, for it looks as if you were not
the proper Objects of Reason's Worship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but we love to be serv'd implicitly; it
shows our Power. Now your Reason is an inquisitive
Free-thinker, that rather prescribes than obeys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It only inquires that it may serve you as you
deserve, a Doctrine Women of your Merit ought to propagate,
and scorn the Offering of Ignorance, that daily sacrifices
to Idols. -- Believe me, the want of Sense makes every
Victory ridiculous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Too much Sense has often the same effect as too
little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then there are fewer ridiculous Things in the
World than I imagin'd.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And so you wou'd have us increase the Number
and marry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And why not -- for People are generally fondest
of their own Jests.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, 'tis a secure Way of never being without 
one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which in a Month's time every Body will laugh
at but ourselves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Does not that Thought frighten you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not when I think how many happy Ages will
rowl round me, and of the painful Hours I am to count
without you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And so you are really in Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As certainly as any one must be that saw you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And how certain is that, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why just as certain as that you don't think I 
flatter when I tell you so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Odious! I don't think of the Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad to hear it, you'll the likelier
consent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since you've help'd me to an Excuse I can't tell 
but I may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then let us lose no Time.

<font>For Beauty like a Shadow flies,
And our Youth before us dies.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Or wou'd Youth and Beauty stay,
Love hath Wings and will away.</font>

But for all that I'll venture -- tho' I'm in the wrong
to consent thus easily, for Men generally measure the
Value of Things by the Difficulty they have in
obtaining 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Quite contrary, Madam, nothing dignifies a
Benefit so much as a readiness in conferring it; and Men
never like any thing for the sake of the Difficulty, but
despise all Difficulties for the sake of what they like;

your own Terms.

I love best.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That will require, Sir, what you won't agree to,
my knowing the Lady, for our Tasts may differ.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Impossible, you may as easily differ from
yourself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That mayn't be so hard a Task, perhaps. But are
you awake, do you know what you say?

that my Mistress is an Angel, and you are another --

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Com.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, indeed, Madam, I'm sure that's what

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Com.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Madam, I have a charming Room

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is Mrs. <font>Florinda</font> to be seen?

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Marlove <font>Sola</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll try how she's inclin'd, before I give a loose
to my Revenge; but why shou'd I be angry with 
<font>Bellamar</font> ? I shew'd him first the way to change his Love, by
being false myself -- Fool that I was, first to give
him up my Person, Honour, and my Heart, and then to
wrong him; he's a Wretch we shou'd despise, that
cou'd forgive an Injury in Love; for such an Easiness
bespeaks Indifferency for us, or else a Meanness in the
Lover's Soul, that everlastingly condemns our Choice
-- But here's <font>Florinda</font> -- Be calm my Griefs.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Florinda <font>with</font> Milton <font>in her Hand</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'll forgive me, dear <font>Marlove</font> , and yet I   
don't
know how to expect it, when I consider what kept me
so long.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If this was it </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>looking at the Book</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must
approve your better Choice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis silly to own it; but I've been as angry with
Mother <font>Eve</font> , as ever Mother was with a Child.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Part provok'd you so?
<pagebreak id="22" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you see -- her Obstinacy in wandring
from her Husband, contrary to his Will and common
Sense -- I can't help thinking it like some of our fine
Ladies, who think their Husbands inhumanly cruel, if
they won't believe they wou'd resist the Charms of all
Mankind united for their sake, and yet won't sacrifice
such a Trifle as a publick Place or Visit to his Quiet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'll make some Man envied, and all
Womankind asham'd, when you marry, if you reason thus.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The latter will be against my Will then; for all
I propose in Marriage, is to make two People as happy
as I can, by never doing any thing to be asham'd of
myself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you do think of marrying?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what will surprize you more, I'll marry
from having thought on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By no means, since you judge too well to
chuse amiss -- shou'd I not be too curious to ask
the happy Man -- Now hold my Heart.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all, since my own Inclinations are
confirm'd by my Brother's Approbation -- though,
perhaps, you'll laugh when I name him, 'tis
<font>Bellamar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish you may have reason to laugh.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's the Danger?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's a Man, that's all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or between you and I, <font>Marlove</font> , I wou'd not
have him; wou'd you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I! not for the <font>Indies</font> -- What stoop to be
the Refuge of a Fop, who brings me the Refuse of 
the whole Town; and, tir'd of Life, wou'd bury himself
with me!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet you persuaded <font>Moderna</font> in my Brother's
Favour, whom you knew a Man of Pleasure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I knew him to be a Man of Honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not <font>Bellamar</font> too a Man of Honour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell, I never trusted him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then when he's mine I beg you never will --
for believe me, <font>Marlove</font> , if he offers to borrow then, it
must be out of Extravagancy.
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d'ye mean, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing, but that I'm glad to be marry'd well;
we Women without a Husband are like Sheep without
a Shepherd, expos'd to Wolves and Foxes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And Marriage, like a Shepherd, saves you from
Wolves and Foxes, only to sell you to the Butcher's
Knife, a Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And so you wou'd have me graze my Life out,
be shorn once a Year to support the Woollen 
Manufactory, cloath Fools, and comfort decay'd Constitutions
-- No, that will never do while my own is so good
-- But don't you think I'm wild, <font>Marlove</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are in the way of being tam'd, remember I
say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad of it, for to tell you the truth, I'm
quite tir'd of this savage Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But had you not better live in a Tree than a 
Cage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, if I had a kind Master, 'twere better than
being disturb'd by hunting Fools and Hawks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I shall wonder at nothing, after your
declaring in favour of the perfidious Sex with the
Frankness of a downright Libertine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll venture to say one thing, Madam, without
thinking myself a Libertine: To subdue our Inclination
to our Duty, is all I know of Virtue; for 'twere
ridiculous to pretend a Merit in the Conquest of what didn't
oppose us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To have a Nature pure, and refin'd from all
Passion, is sure a higher degree of Excellence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But since such a one is not upon Earth, I shall
insist 'tis in Resistance we acquire our Fame.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I cou'd never come up to you --
What, go to Church and declare to the whole
Congregation that I've the Inclinations of a Brute! Oh! I am
ready to faint at the Thought of it!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May be you think the Place too publick; that
puts me in mind of a Lady, who wou'd never taste
Wine at Table where ev'ry Body drank it, and got a
red Face by drinking strong Waters in her Closet.
<pagebreak id="24" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Red Face, Madam -- mine is no redder than 
yours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes it is -- No -- Now 'tis pale again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I've gone too far </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must          
dissemble, or
my Looks will betray me -- I beg Pardon, dear
<font>Florinda</font> , I've only rallied all this time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad to hear it, I protest I was almost out of
Temper, to hear you maintain an Argument so different
from your former Conversation -- I hope I have said
nothing I shou'd not, I mightily fear I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing I assure you, but what I shou'd have 
said in your Case -- Here's your Brother, he seems
pleas'd.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Worthy.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> Marlove</font> , you must be Witness this Night to the
greatest Happiness of my Life, next to <font>Moderna</font> --
Sister, <font>Bellamar</font> overjoy'd me with the News of your
Consent, and begs I'll not delay. So I'm resolv'd I will not
sleep till he's pleas'd -- You may sleep as much as
you think fit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I may, without blushing, own an Esteem that's
authoriz'd by you -- tho' my Friend <font>Marlove</font> has
almost put me out of Humour with Mankind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord, Child, I told you I was but in jest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she'll follow your Example, I'll answer for it
she'll change her Mind. I must dance at your Wedding,
remember, <font>Marlove</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twere kinder to dance at one's Funeral, for
that is the End of our Sorrows, the other the 
Beginning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not I tell you how averse she was -- 
What is it, dear <font>Marlove</font> , has chang'd you so o'th'
sudden?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Banter, meer Banter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing else, I assure you -- Lord, did you
never say a Thing for the sake of saying it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never; and I thank God I have not Wit enough
to teach my Tongue a Language different from my 
Heart.
<pagebreak id="25" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May no Time nor Chance dissolve the happy
Union then; and so I take my Leave of you.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Flor,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see any thing so alter'd? What
can it mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't guess; a secret Sorrow seem'd to hang
about her, that discover'd itself the more she labour'd
to conceal it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Flor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It's odd, this strange Dislike to Matrimony shou'd
seize her at this time. I remember nothing Gayer at
your Wedding than she was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I did not know Malice and Envy had Ten
thousand Tongues, and they all false, her Conduct would
almost tempt me to believe common Fame; and that her
Aversion to your marrying <font>Bellamar</font> was like some
memorable Patriot's Hatred to absolute Power, they could
not endure it in any Hands except their own. -- But I
had forgot my Friend; I am accountable to him for every

he's now grown painful to me. Our Hate
encreases with our Crimes; and the Sight of him we have

and talking
to yourself: Trust me, my Dear, it is unkind to rob my
Eyes and Ears of all that can delight 'em. I've been
this Hour in search of you to let you know I'm resolv'd
this Evening to give my Sister to <font>Bellamar</font> , if you
approve of it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Believe me, my <font>Moderna</font> , 'tis mightily your
Interest to have my Judgment good; for it speaks

be neither of the three by Choice.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bellamar, <font>overhearing</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But why are you not as ready to help Nature in
the Improvement of your Humour, as you are artful in
mending your Complexion, and concealing your Age?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because, being better humour'd were to
cultivate a Weakness that puts it in your Power to impose
upon us, whilst looking young and handsome enables us
to cheat you. And 'tis in Love as 'tis in Play, you must
be the Knave or the Fool.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a way of Reasoning pardonable in none
but those ruin'd by Play. I hope no ill Run has turn'd
you Gamester, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Matter: I shall never attempt repairing my
Loss by one who understands all the Game. You are in
no Danger, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In no Danger, <font>Marlove</font> ! Is he not going to be
married? I told you you'd change your Mind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So will he, if he has not chang'd his Nature.

snuff those dim Eyes of hers, and twinkle after Hearts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then when she would be obliging or civil, she's
as nauseous as the old <font>English</font> Hospitality, that brings you

   <nonSpeech> <font>Maid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Mr. <font>Townley</font> is below.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Show him up. He is an old Admirer of mine.
I could, if he would assist me in my Revenge, be
tempted to do that out of Malice, which I shall never do
out of Love; for <font>Lurcher</font> , I fear, is too great a Fool to
be of any use.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Townley <font>a little fuddled</font> .</nonSpeech> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Love and the Hickup have seiz'd me so of the
sudden, I can't tell the dear Creature how much I love
the Tip of her little Finger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall I get you any thing to bring up the mighty
Nothing you are big with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three Go-downs of you would do me more
good than warm Water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You want warm Water to wash those Hands of 
thine, and that dear dirty Face. Why, Man, thou'rt as
dirty as a Chymist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And as hot as his Fire. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickups, and offers to
kiss her.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Foh! And as windy as the Bellows that blows
it. But prithee where hast been?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's not to the purpose; shall I tell you 
where I would be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where all drunken Men generally would be, in
the Place they are oftner troublesome than pleasing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks you Women shou'd like Drunkenness,
for it opens Mens Purses, and shuts their Eyes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But not their Mouths, Beast: Women hate
Drunkards, for they neither keep their Words nor a 
Secret.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you Women all keep your Words, because
no Body will take 'em. Then for your Secrets you
never trust us with any, but the Subject of a Quarrel
betwixt you and your She Friend, how inhumanly she
made you wait at Home to go with her to the Opera;
<pagebreak id="31" />
be deny'd to seventy or eighty Bosom Friends; and
neglect paying a hundred Visits that the last Winter was too
short to pay: but indeed you're not sorry, since you've
heard her Character, of any Pretence to break off an
Acquaintance that had neither Credit or Entertainment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, you Brute, wou'd you have me believe,
if we repos'd greater Confidence, you wou'd not deceive
us? I would as soon trust <font>Isabella</font> at Play.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It's better doing that than never play.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To those that have the Rage of Gaming.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you never divert yourself with those dear
Fingers? Let me buss 'em. I warrant they are always
full of Court-Cards that crowd about 'em as about
Favourites, to guide 'em to the Port of Preferment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nonsense! What does the Fool mean by Fingers,
Favourites, Port and Preferment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you do not know what I mean I'll explain
myself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, trust that to any Understanding rather than
your own; 'twill be to your Advantage
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay then -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Offers to kiss her.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you're thus rude, I vow I'll keep my
Resolution, and --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Till it spoils in this warm Weather; but it
shan't be my Fault. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Offers to kiss her again.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stand off, Impertinence; d'ye think this
Impudence will prevail?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If that don't, I have neither Wealth, nor
Beauty; and for Modesty that never did; so I have no Hopes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Case is not so desperate as you imagine
perhaps -- If you, in return to any Favour you wou'd
obtain, will <font>grant another</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let the Proposal be what it will, you promise?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Provided it be not Murder, Treason, nor
Marriage, I do promise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None of them; and upon this Condition, an Hour
hence I'll meet you at <font>Spring-Garden</font> . Remember you 
perform.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Keep your Appointment, and you shall find I
will perform, and Wonders too. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech>Bellamar <font>speaking to</font> Worthy's <font>Footman</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where's your Master?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Footm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know, Sir. My Lady is at Mrs.
<font>Commode's</font> Shop. She sent the Coach and me away with
Mrs. <font>Marlove</font> , with Orders to return in an Hour, and
wait for her here.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Bellamar <font>walks up towards Mrs.</font> Trifle's <font>Shop</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Servant, Mrs. <font>Trifle</font> ; how goes new      
Fashions
and old Promises?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Trifle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why truly, Sir, neither to my Advantage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you had no Ladies this Afternoon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Trifle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None, except Madam <font>Moderna</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it long since she went?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Trifle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Sir, at least an Hour: Mr. <font>Alamode</font> and
she just staid to laugh at my Lady, and went away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, together! It's pretty odd, send her Coach
and her Servants away. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your servant, Mrs.
<font>Trifle</font> ; I wish, for your sake, little Heads may go out
of Fashion. Pray make hast with what I sent about.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Goes to the other end of the</font> Change, <font>and meets</font>
Alamode <font>handing</font> Moderna <font>out of a Hackney-Coach</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha! is not that <font>Alamode</font> and <font>Moderna</font> coming out of a 
Hackney-Coach?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't this look strange, <font>Bellamar</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By no means, Madam, 'tis the commonest thing
in Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Marlove</font> and I had certainly been kill'd; for the
Coach broke at <font>Temple-Bar</font> ; and if Mr. <font>Alamode</font> had not
come by, I know not what we should have done without
him. Pray, Heaven, <font>Marlove</font> has kept the Coach. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I live but to serve the Fair, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And your Friend, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After them <font>Bellamar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Both at once sometimes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mod.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm frighten'd to Death; he seems suspicious.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you are expected at our House to Night.
I'm the unluckiest Creature. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="33" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Alla.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll not fail. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Mod.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope, Sir, you'll come and see the last of your 
humble Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Alla.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How soon, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You can never come too soon. In an Hour at
farthest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ala.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll not fail waiting on you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt        
Ambo.</foreign> They
