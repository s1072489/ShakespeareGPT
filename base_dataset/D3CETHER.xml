<nonSpeech> <font>Enter my Lady</font> Townly, <font>and</font> Emilia.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady Townly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> Was afraid <font>Emilia</font> , all had been 
discover'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tremble with the Apprehension still.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That my Brother should take Lodgings i'the 
Very House where you lie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas lucky, we had timely notice to warn the 
People to be secret, he seems to be a mighty good 
Humour'd old man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He ever had a notable smerking way with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He calls me Rogue, tells me he can't abide me;
And does so bepat me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my word you are much in his favour then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has been very inquisitive I am told about my 
Family, my reputation, and my Fortune.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am confident he does not i'the least suspect 
You are the Woman his Son's in Love with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shou'd make him then inform himself so
<pagebreak id="18" /> 
Particularly of me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was always of a very Loving Temper himself; 
It may be he has a doating Fit upon him, who knows.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It cannot be. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Young Bellair.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here comes my Nephew. Where did 
You leave your Father?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Writing a Note within, <font>Emilia</font> , this early 
visit
Looks as if some kind Jealousie wou'd not let you 
Rest at home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The knowledge I have of my Rival, 
Gives me a little cause to fear your Constancy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Constancy! I vow --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do not vow -- Our love is frail as is our life, and
Full as little in our power, and are you sure you shall
Out-live this day? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not, but when we are in perfect health,   
'twere 
An idle thing to fright our selves with the thoughts of
Sudden death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what has pass'd between you and your Father 
I'the Garden?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's firm in his resolution, 
Tells me I must marry Mrs. <font>Harriet</font> , 
Or swears hee'l marry himself, 
And disinherit me, when I saw I could not 
Prevail with him to be more indulgent, I dissembled 
An Obedience to his Will, which has compos'd his passion, 
And will give us time, and I hope opportunity to 
Deceive him. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Old Bellair, <font>with a Note in his hand</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Peace, here he comes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Harry</font> , take this, and let your man carry 
it for me 
To Mr. <font>Fourbes</font> Chamber, my Lawyer i'the Temple.
Neighbour, a Dod I am glad to see thee here, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Emilia.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Make much of her Sister, she's one 
Of the best of your acquaintance; I like her 
Countenance and her behaviour well, she has
A Modesty that is not Common i'this Age, a Dod, 
She has.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know her value Brother, and esteem her          
accordingly.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Advise her to wear a little more mirth in her
Face, a Dod, she's too serious.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The fault is very excusable in a young Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, a Dod, I like her ne're the worse, a 
Melancholy Beauty has her Charms, I 
Love a pretty sadness in a Face which varies 
Now and Then, like changeable Colours, into a smile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks you speak very feelingly Brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am but Five and Fifty Sister you know, an
Age not altogether unsensible! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Emilia.</nonSpeech><dialogue> chear up sweet 
Heart; I have a secret to tell thee may 
Chance to make thee merry, we three  will make 
Collation together anon, i'the mean time
Mum, I can't abide you, go I can't 
Abide you -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Young Bellair.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Harry</font> , Come, you
Must along with me to my Lady <font>Woodvills</font> . 
I am going to slip the Boy at a Mistress.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At a Wife Sir, you wou'd say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You need not look so glum, Sir, a 
Wife is no Curse when she brings the blessing 
Of a good Estate with her, but an idle Town 
Flurt, with a painted Face, a rotten Reputation, 
And a crasie Fortune, a Dod is the Devil and all, 
And such a one I hear you are in League with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot help detraction, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Old. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out, a pise o' their Breeches, there are 
Keeping Fools enough for such flaunting 
Baggages, and they are e'ne too good for 'em.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Emilia.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Remember Night, go y'are a Rogue, y'are a 
Rogue; fare you well, fare you well; come, come, 
Come along, Sir. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex.</font> Old <font>and</font> Y. Bellair.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my Word the old man comes on apace; 
I'le lay my life he's smitten.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is nothing but the pleasantness of his     
humour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know him better than you, let it work, 
It may prove lucky. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter a</font> Page.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Mr. <font>Medley</font> has sent to know 
Whether a Visit will not be Troublesome 
<pagebreak id="20" />
This Afternoon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Send him word his visits never are so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's a very pleasant man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's a very necessary man among us Women; 
He's not scandalous i'the least, perpetually 
Contriving to bring good Company together, 
And always ready to stop up a gap at Ombre,
Then he knows all the little news o'the Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I love to hear him talk o' the Intrigues, 
Let 'em be never so dull in themselves, he'l 
Make 'em pleasant i'the relation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But he improves things so much one can take no
Measure of the Truth from him. 
Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> swears a Flea or a Maggot, is 
Not made more monstrous by a magnifying 
Glass, than a story is by his telling it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, here he comes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Medley.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Medley</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Servant Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have made your self a Stranger of late.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe you took a surfeit of Ombre 
Last time you were here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed I had my Belly full of that Tarmagant,
Lady Dealer; there never was so unsatiable 
A Carder, an old Gleeker never lov'd to sit 
To't like her; I have plaid with her now at 
Least a dozen times, till she'as worn out all
Her fine Complexion, and her Tour wou'd 
Keep in Curl no longer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blame her not poor Woman, she loves nothing
So well as a black Ace.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The pleasure I have seen her in when she has had   
hope
In drawing for a Matadore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis as pretty sport to her, as perswading 
Masks off is to you to make discoveries.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray where's your Friend, Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soliciting his affairs, he's a man of great 
Imployment, has more Mistresses now depending 
<pagebreak id="21" />
Than the most eminent Lawyer in <font>England</font> 
Has Causes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here has been Mrs. <font>Loveit</font> , so uneasie and 
Out of humour these two days.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How strangely love and Jealousie rage 
In that poor Woman!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She cou'd not have pick'd out a Devil 
Upon Earth so proper to Torment her,
Has made her break a dozen or two of  
Fans already, tare half a score Points in pieces, 
And destroy Hoods and Knots without number.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We heard of a pleasant Serenade he gave 
Her tother Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Danish Serenade with Kettle Drums, and Trumpets.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Barbarous!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, you are of the number of the Ladies whose
Ears are grown so delicate since our 
Operas, you can be charm'd with nothing 
But Flute doux, and French Hoboys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Leave your raillery, and tell us, is there any 
New Wit come forth, Songs or Novels?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very pretty piece of gallantry, by an 
Eminent Author, call'd, <font>the diversions of 
Bruxells</font> , very necessary to be read by all 
Old Ladies who are desirous to improve themselves 
At Questions and Commands, Blindmans buff,
And the like fashionable recreations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Ridiculous!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then there is the Art of affectation, written 
By a late beauty of Quality, teaching you how 
To draw up your Breasts, stretch up your neck, 
To thrust out your Breech, to play with your Head, 
To toss up your Nose, to bite your Lips, to turn 
Up your Eyes, to speak in a silly soft tone of a 
Voice, and use all the Foolish French Words 
That will infallibly make your person and 
Conversation charming, with a short apologie 
At the latter end, in the behalf of young Ladies, 
<pagebreak id="22" />
Who notoriously wash, and paint, though they 
Have naturally good Complexions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emilia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a deal of stuff you tell us?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such as the Town affords Madam. 
The <font>Russians</font> hearing the great respect we 
Have for Foreign Dancing, have lately sent 
Over some of their best Balladins, who are
Now practising a famous Ballat which will 
Be suddenly danc'd at the <font>Bear-Garden</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray forbear your idle stories, and give us 
An account of the state of Love, as it now stands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly there has been some revolutions in those
Affairs, great chopping and changing among the 
Old, and some new Lovers, whom malice, 
Indiscretion, and misfortune, have luckily 
Brought into play.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you of walking into the next Room,
And sitting down before you engage in this business?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wait upon you , and I hope (though Women 
Are commonly unreasonable) by the plenty of 
Scandal I shall discover, to give you very good 
Content Ladies.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>

 <head>SCENE II.</head> 

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Mrs.</font> Loveit <font>and</font> Pert.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Mrs.</font> Loveit <font>putting up a Letter, then pulling
out her pocket Glass, and looking in it</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pert.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hate my self, I look so ill to day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hate the wicked cause on't, that base man 
Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> , who makes you torment and 
Vex your self continually.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is to blame indeed.
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To blame to be two days without sending, 
Writing, or coming near you, contrary to 
His Oath and Covenant; 'Twas to much 
Purpose to make him swear; I'll lay my 
Life there's not an Article but he has Broken, 
Talk'd to the Vizards i'the Pit, waited upon the 
Ladies from the Boxes to their Coaches; gone behind 
The Scenes, and fawn'd upon those little insignificant 
Creatures, the Players; 'tis impossible for a man 
Of his inconstant temper to forbear I'm sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know he is a Devil, but he has something of the
Angel yet undefac'd in him, which 
Makes him so charming and agreeable, that I 
Must love him be he never so wicked.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I little thought Madam to see your spirit 
Taim'd to this degree, who banish'd poor 
Mr. <font>Lackwit</font> but for taking up another Ladies 
Fan in your presence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My knowing of such odious Fools, contributes to 
the
Making of me Love <font>Dorimant</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Dorimrnt</font> </comment>        
the better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your knowing of Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> , in my mind,    
shou'd
Rather make you hate all mankind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it does, besides himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, what excuse does he make in his Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has had business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Business in general terms wou'd not have 
Been a currant excuse for another; 
A Modish Man is always very busie 
When he is in pursuit of a new Mistress.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some Fop has brib'd you to rail at him; 
He had business, I will believe it, and will forgive him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may forgive him any thing, but I shall never
Forgive him his turning me into Ridicule, 
As I hear he does.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive you are of the number of those 
Fools his Wit has made his Enemies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am of the number of those he's pleas'd 
To railly, Madam; and if we may believe 
<pagebreak id="24" />
Mr. <font>Wagfan</font> , and Mr. <font>Caperwell</font> , he sometimes 
Makes merry with your self too, among 
His Laughing Companions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blockheads are as malicious to witty men, 
As ugly Women are to the handsome; 'tis 
Their Interest, and they make it their business 
To defame 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> wou'd not make 
It his business to defame you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shou'd he, I had rather be made infamous 
By him, than owe my reputation to the dull 
Discretion of those Fops you talk off. 
<font>Bellinda</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>running to her.</font> </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bellinda.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have been unkind of late.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do not say unkind, say unhappy!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cou'd chide you, 
Where have you been these two days?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pitty me rather my dear, where I have been 
So tired with two or three Country Gentlewomen,
Whose conversation has been more 
Unsufferable than a Country Fiddle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are they Relations?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Welch acquaintance I made when I was last year
At St. <font>Winefreds</font> , they have asked me a thousand
Questions of the Modes and Intrigues of the Town,  
And I have told 'em almost as many things for news 
That hardly were so, when their Gowns were in Fashion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Provoking Creatures, how cou'd you endure e'm?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now to carry on my Plot, nothing but love 
Cou'd make me capable of so much falshood; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
'Tis time to begin, lest <font>Dorimant</font> shou'd 
Come before her Jealousie has stung her; 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Laughs and then speaks on.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I was yesterday at a Play with 'em, 
Where I was fain to shew 'em the living, as the 
<pagebreak id="25" />
Man at <font>Westminster</font> does the dead; that is 
Mrs. such a one admired for her Beauty,
This is Mr. such a one cry'd up for a Wit; 
That is sparkish Mr. such a one who 
Keeps reverend Mrs. such a one, and there
Sits fine Mrs. such a one who was lately 
Cast off by my Lord such a one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see <font>Dorimant</font> there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did, and imagine you were there with him, 
And have no mind to own it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shou'd make you think so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Lady mask'd in a pretty dishabillie`, 
Whom <font>Dorimant</font> entertain'd with more 
Respect, than the Gallants do a Common Vizard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dorimant</font> at the Play entertaining a Mask, 
Oh Heavens! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he stay all the while?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Till the Play was done, and then led her 
Out, which confirms me it was you!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Traytor!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now you may believe he had business, and 
You may forgive him too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ingrateful perjur'd man!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seem so much concern'd my Dear, 
I fear I have told you unawares what I 
Had better have conceal'd for your Quiet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What manner of shape had she?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tall and slender, her motions were very gentile, 
Certainly she must be some person of condition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shame and confusion be ever in her face 
When she shows it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should blame your discretion for loving that
Wild man my Dear, but they say he has a way 
So bewitching, that few can defend their hearts 
Who know him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tear him from mine, or die i'the attempt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be more moderate.
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wou'd I had Daggers, Darts, or poyson'd Arrows  
in my
Breast, so I cou'd but remove the thoughts 
Of him from thence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, fie, your transports are too Violent, my Dear.
This may be but an accidental Gallantry, 
And 'tis likely ended at her Coach.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shou'd it proceed farther, let your comfort be,
The Conduct Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> affects, will 
Quickly make you know your Rival, ten to one 
Let you see her ruin'd, her reputation expos'd 
To the Town; a happiness none will envy her 
But your self Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who e're she be, all the harm I wish her, is, may
She love him as well as I do, and may he give her 
As much cause to hate him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never doubt the latter end of your Curse Madam!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May all the passions that are rais'd by neglected
Love, Jealousie, Indignation, Spight, and Thirst of 
Revenge, eternally rage in her Soul, as they do 
Now in mine. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Walks up and down with a distracted air.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not see him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told him you were within, Madam.

I fear this restlessness of the body, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>pursuing her</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Proceeds from an unquietness of the mind. 
What unlucky accident puts you out of  
<pagebreak id="27" />
Humour; a Point ill-wash'd, Knots spoil'd i'the 
Making up, Hair shaded awry, or some 
Other little mistake insetting you in order?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A trifle in my opinion, Sir, more inconsiderable
Than any you mention.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Mrs. <font>Pert</font> , I never knew you sullen enough
To be silent, come let me know the business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The business, Sir, is the business that has taken 
you 
Up these two days; how have I seen you 
Laugh at men of business, and now to become a man 
Of business your self!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are not Masters of our own affections, our
Inclinations daily alter; now we love pleasure, and 
Anon we shall doat on business; humane 
Frailty will have it so, and who can help it;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faithless, inhumane, barbarous man --

Gratitude, 
Tell me, for I will know, what Devil mask'd 
She was, you were with at the Play yesterday?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith I resolv'd as much as you, but the 
Devil was obstinate, and wou'd not tell me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> False in this as in your Vows to me, you do know!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The truth is, I did all I cou'd to know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And dare you own it to my Face? 
Hell and Furies! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tears her Fan in pieces.</font> </nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Y'are the most mistaken Man i'the World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It must be so, and here I vow revenge; resolve
<pagebreak id="28" />
To pursue, and persecute you more impertinently 
Than ever any Loving Fop did his Mistress, hunt 
You i'the <font>Park</font> , trace you i'the <font>Mail</font> , Dog 
You in every visit you make, haunt you at 
The Plays, and i'the Drawing Room, hang my 
Nose in your neck, and talk to you whether 
You will or no, and ever look upon you with such 
Dying Eyes, till your Friends grow Jealous of me, 
Send you out of Town, and the World suspect 
Your reputation. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>In a lower voice.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good! There's one made Jealous already.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this the constancy you vow'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Constancy at my years! 'tis not a Vertue in 
Season, you might as well expect the Fruit the 
Autumn ripens i'the Spring.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Monstrous Principle!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Youth has a long Journey to go, Madam, shou'd  
I have set up my rest at the first Inn I lodg'd at, 
I shou'd never have arriv'd at the happiness I now enjoy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dissembler, damn'd Dissembler! 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am so I confess, good nature, and good manners
Corrupt me. I am honest in my inclinations, and 
Wou'd not, wer't not to avoid offence, make a 
Lady a little in years believe I think her young, wilfully 
Mistake Art for Nature; and seem as fond of a thing 
I am weary off, as when I doated on't in earnest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> False Man. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now you begin to show your self!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Love gilds us over, and makes us show fine things 
To one another for a time, but soon the Gold 
Wears off, and then again the native brass appears.
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Think on your Oaths, your Vows and Protestations. 
Perjur'd Man!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I made 'em when I was in love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And therefore ought they not to bind? 
Oh Impious!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What we swear at such a time may be a certain proof 
Of a present passion, but to say truth, in Love there is
No security to be given for the future.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Horrid and ingrateful, begone, 
And never see me more!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not one of those troublesome Coxcombs, who
Because they were once well receiv'd, take the 
Priviledge to plague a Woman with their Love ever 
After; I shall obey you, Madam, though I do my 
Self some violence. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>He offers to go, and</font> Loveit <font>pulls him

   <nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come back, you sha'not go. 
Cou'd you have the ill nature to offer it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When love grows diseas'd the best thing we can do
Is to put it to a Violent Death; I cannot 
Endure the torture of a lingring and 
Consumptive passion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you think mine sickly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, 'tis desperately Ill! what worse symptomes
Are there than your being always uneasie when 
I visit you, your picking quarrels with me on 
Slight occasions, and in my absence kindly listning 
To the impertinences of every fashionable Fool 
That talks to you? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What fashionable Fool can you lay to my charge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why the very Cock-fool of all those Fools, Sir

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw him in my life but once.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The worse Woman you at first sight to put on 
All your charms, to entertain him with that softness 
In your voice, and all that wanton kindness in your 
Eyes, you so notoriously affect, when you design 
A Conquest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So damn'd a lie did never malice yet invent; 
<pagebreak id="30" />
Who told you this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter; that ever I shou'd love a Woman that
Can doat on a senceless Caper, a Tawdry French 
Riband, and a Formal Cravat!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You make me mad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A guilty Conscience may do much,
Go on, be the Game-Mistress o'the Town, and 
Enter all our young Fops, as fast as they come 
From travail.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Base and Scurrilous!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A fine mortifying reputation 'twill be for a 
Woman of your Pride, Wit, and Quality!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Jealousy's a meer pretence, a cursed trick
Of your own devising; I know you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Believe it and all the ill of me you can, I wou'd
Not have a Woman have the least good thought 
Of me, that can think well of <font>Fopling</font> ; farewel, 
Fall too, and much good may do you with your Coxcomb.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stay, oh stay, and I will tell you all.

Were it my concern. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex.</font> Pert.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> H'as frighted me from the very thoughts of 
Loving men; for Heav'ns sake, my dear, 
Do not discover what I told you; I dread his tongue 
As much as you ought to have done his Friendship.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lightning blast him!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I told him you desired him to come back, 
He smil'd, made a mouth at me, flung into his 
Coach, and said --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Drive away, and then repeated Verses.

Monster, Barbarian; I could tear my self in pieces. 
Revenge, nothing but Revenge can ease me; Plague,

   <nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear Madam! 
Let me set that Curl in order.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me alone, I will shake 'em all out of order.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you never leave this Wilderness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Torment me not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look! there's a Knot falling off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let it drop.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But one pin, dear Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do I daily suffer under thy Officious Fingers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah the difference that is between 
You and my Lady <font>Dapper</font> ? how uneasy she is 
If the least thing be amiss about her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is indeed most exact! nothing is ever wanting
To make her ugliness remarkable!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Jeering people say so!
<pagebreak id="32" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her powdering, painting, and her patching never    
fail in
Publick to draw the tongues and Eyes of all the men upon her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is indeed a little too pretending.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Women should set up for beauty as much in spite 
Of nature, as some men have done for Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope without offence one may endeavour 
To make ones self agreeable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not, when 'tis impossible. Women then 
Ought to be no more fond of dressing than Fools 
Should be of talking; Hoods and Modesty, 
Masques and Silence, things that shaddow and conceal; 
They should think of nothing else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Jesu! Madam, what will your Mother think is 
Become of you? for Heav'ns sake go in again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I won't!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the Extravangant'st thing that ever
You did in your life, to leave her and a Gentleman 
Who is to be your Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Husband! 
Hast thou so little wit to think I spoke what I meant 
When I over-joy'd her in the Country, with a low Courtsy, 
And what you please, Madam, I shall ever be obedient.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I know not, you have so many fetches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And this was one, to get her up to <font>London</font> !
Nothing else I assure thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, the man, in my mind, is a fine man!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The man indeed wears his Cloaths fashionably, and
Has a pretty negligent way with him, very Courtly,
And much affected; he bows, and talks, and smiles
So agreeably as he thinks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw any thing so gentile!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Varnish'd over with good breeding, many a 
Blockhead makes a tolerable show.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wonder you do not like him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think I might be brought to endure him, and that 
is
All a reasonable Woman should expect in a Husband, but
There is duty i'the case -- and like the haughty <font>Merab</font> , I
<font>Find much aversion in my stubborn mind</font> ,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Leave your prating, and sing some foolish Song or

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You expect I should take it ill I see!

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The confidence is generous, and in return I could

Find in my heart to let you know my inclinations.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, with this dear Town, to that

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for us, I find we shall agree well enough!

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> L. Townley, Emilia, <font>and Mr.</font> Medley.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pitty the young lovers, we last talk'd of,
Though to say truth their conduct has been so indiscreet,
They deserve to be unfortunate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Medley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Y' have had an exact account, from the great Lady 
I'th'Box down to the little Orange wench.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Y' are a living Libel, a breathing Lampoon; I
Wonder you are not torn in pieces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you of setting up an Office of          
Intelligence 
For these matters? the project may get Money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You would have great dealings with country     
Ladies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> More than <font>Muddiman</font> has
With their husbands. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bellinda.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Bellinda</font> , what has been become of you! we
Have not seen you here of late 
With your friend Mrs <font>Lovit</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bellin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear creature, I left her but now so sadly      
afflicted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With her old distemper Jealousy!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dorimant</font> has plaid her some new prank.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, that <font>Dorimant</font> is certainly the worst 
Man breathing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I once thought so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And do you not think so still?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No indeed!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Jesu!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Town does him a great deal of Injury, and I
Will never believe what it says of a man I do 
Not know again for his sake!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You make me wonder!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's a very well bred man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But strangely ill-natur'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he's a very Witty man!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But a man of no principles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your man of Principles is a very fine thing indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To be preferr'd to men of parts by Women who have
<pagebreak id="38" /> 
Regard to their Reputation and quiet. Well were I minded 
To play the Fool, he shou'd be the last man I'd think of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has been the first in many Ladyes favours, though 
You are so severe, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What he may be for a Lover I know not, but
He's a very pleasant acquaintance I am sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you seen him use Mrs <font>Loveit</font> as I have done,
You wou'd never endure him more -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What he has quarrel'd with her again!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the slightest occasion, he's Jealous 
Of Sir <font>Fopling</font> . 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She never saw him in her life but 
Yesterday, and that was here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my Conscience! he's the only man in Town
That's her aversion, how horribly out of humour 
She was all the while he talk'd to her!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And some body has wickedly told him --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here he comes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Dorimant.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dorimant</font> ! you are luckily come to justify 
Your self -- here's a Lady -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has a word or two to say to you from a 
Disconsolate person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You tender your Reputation too much I know Madam, 
To whisper with me before this good Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To serve Mrs. <font>Loveit</font> , I'll make a bold       
venture.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's <font>Medley</font> the very Spirit of Scandal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis something you are unwilling to 
Hear, Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell him <font>Bellinda</font> whether he will or no!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Loveit</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>aloud.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Softly, these are laughers, you do not know 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a Word y'ave made me hate you,                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Dor. <font>apart</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Which I thought you never could have done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In obeying your Commands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas a cruel part you play'd! how could you act  
it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing is cruel to a man who could kill himself
To please you; remember Five a Clock to morrow Morning.
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tremble when you name it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be sure you come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sha'not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Swear you will!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Swear I say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my life! by all the happiness I hope for -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Kind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am glad i've sworn, I vow I think I should ha'
Fail'd you else!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surprisingly kind! in what temper did 
You leave <font>Loveit</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her raving was prettily over, and she began to be
In a brave way of defying you, and all your works.
Where have you been since you went from thence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I look'd in at the Play.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have promis'd and must return to her agen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Perswade her to walk in the Mail this evening
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She hates the place and will not come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do all you can to prevail with her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Fopling</font> will be here anon, I'll prepare him 
To set upon her there before me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You persecute her too much, but I'll do all you'l 
ha'me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell her plainly, 'tis grown so dull a business    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>aloud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I can drudge on no longer.   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There are afflictions in Love Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You Women make 'em, who are commonly as 
Unreasonable in that as you are at Play; without 
The Advantage be on your side, a man can never 
Quietly give over when he's weary?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you would play without being obliged to
Complaisance <font>Dorimant</font> , you should play in 
Publick places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ordinaries were a very good thing for that, 
But Gentlemen do not of late frequent 'em; the

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This confidence will go nigh to spoil this

Are brought up under practising Lawyers prove 
The abler Council when they come to be call'd

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Town has been very favourable to you 
This afternoon, my Lady <font>Townley</font> , you use to have 
An Ambara's of Chaires and Coaches at your Door, 
An uproar of Footmen in your Hall, and a noise 
Of Fools above here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Town.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed my House is the general rendevouze,
And next to the Play-house is the Common 
Refuge of all the Young idle people.

Wonder you do not love it a little more Chosen.

Should love Wit, but for Variety, be able to divert 
Our selves with the Extravagancies of those who want it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fools will make you laugh.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Emil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For once or twice! but the repetition of their
Folly after a visit or two grows tedious and unsufferable.

Life he passes for a Wit with many.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That may very well be, Nature has her cheats, stum's 
A brain, and puts sophisticate dulness often on the tastless
Multitude for true wit and good humour. <font>Medley</font> , Come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must go a little way, I will meet you i'the Mail.

 <head>SCENE III. <font>THE</font> MAIL.</head> 

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Harriet, Y. Bellair, <font>she pulling him</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come along.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And leave your Mother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Busie</font> will be sent with a Hue and Cry after us; 
But that's no matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twill look strangely in me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She'l believe it a freak of mine, and never blame
Your manners.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What reverend acquaintance is that she has met?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A fellow-beauty of the last Kings time, though by  
the 
Ruines you would hardly guess it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Dorimant <font>and crosses the Stage</font> .</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="45" />
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Y. Bellair, <font>and</font> Harriet.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By this time your Mother is in a fine taking.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If your Friend Mr. <font>Dorimant</font> were but here now,
That she might find me talking with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She does not know him but dreads him I hear of
All Mankind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She concludes if he does but speak to a 
Woman she's undone, is on her knees every day to 
Pray Heav'n defend me from him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not apprehend him so much as she does.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw any thing in him that was frightful.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On the contrary, have you not observed something 
Extream delightful in his Wit and Person?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's agreeable and pleasant I must own, but he
Does so much affect being so, he displeases me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord Madam, all he does and says, is so easie,
And so natural.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some Mens Verses seem so to the unskilful,
But labour i'the one, and affectation in the other 
To the Judicious plainly appear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never heard him accus'd of affectation before.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Dorimant <font>and stares upon her</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It passes on the easie Town, who are favourably
Pleas'd in him to call it humour.                                    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex.</font> Y. Bellair <font>and</font> Harriet.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis she! it must be she, that lovely hair, that 
Easie shape, those wanton Eyes, and all those melting
Charms about her mouth, which <font>Medley</font> spoke of; 
I'll follow the Lottery, and put in for a 
Prize with my friend <font>Bellair</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex. Dor.</font> repeating.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>In Love the Victors from the

   They fly that Wound, and they pursue that dy.</font>
<pagebreak id="46" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Y. Bellair, <font>and</font> Harriet, <font>and after them</font> Dorimant
<font>standing at a distance</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most people prefer <font>High Park</font> to this place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It has the better Reputation I confess: but I
Abominate the dull diversions there, the formal bows,  
The Affected smiles, the silly by-Words, and 
Amorous Tweers, in passing; here one meets with 
A little conversation now and then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These conversations have been fatal 
To some of your Sex, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be so, because some who want temper
Have been undone by gaming, must others who have it
Wholly deny themselves the pleasure of Play?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Trust me, it were unreasonable Madam.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coming up gently, and bowing to her.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord! who's this?                                  
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She Starts and looks grave.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dorimant.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this the Woman your Father would 
Have you marry?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Harriet.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not mistaken, she's handsome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Talk to her, her Wit is better than her face; 
We were wishing for you but now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Overcast with seriousness o' the sudden!           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Harriet.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
A thousand smiles were shining in that Face but now; 
I never saw so quick a change of Weather.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I feel as great a change within; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
But he shall never know it.    
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were talking of Play, Madam, Pray 
What may be your stint?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little harmless discourse in publick walks, 
Or at most an appointment in a Box barefac'd 
At the Play-House; you are for Masks, and 
Private meetings; where Women engage
<pagebreak id="47" /> 
For all they are worth I hear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been us'd to deep Play, but I can make one
At small Game, when I like my Gamester well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And be so unconcern'd you'l ha' no pleasure in't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where there is a considerable sum to be won, the
Hope of drawing people in, makes every trifle considerable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The sordidness of mens natures I know makes 'em 
Willing to flatter and comply with the Rich, though they
Are sure never to be the better for 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis in their power to do us good, and we despair
Not but at some time or other they may be willing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To men who have far'd in this Town like you,
'Twould be a great Mortification to live on hope; 
Could you keep a Lent for a Mistriss?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In expectation of a happy Easter, and though time
Be very precious, think forty daies well lost, to gain your
Favour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Bellair</font> ! let us walk, 'tis time to leave  
him,
Men grow dull when they begin to be particular.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Y'are mistaken, flattery will not ensue, though I  
know 
Y'are greedy of the praises of the whole Mail.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do me wrong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not, as I follow'd you, I observ'd how you
Were pleased when the <font>Fops</font> cry'd she's handsome, very
Handsome, by God she is, and whisper'd aloud your name,
The thousand several forms you put your face into; then,
To make your self more agreeable, how wantonly you play'd
With your head, flung back your locks, and look'd smilingly 
Over your shoulder at 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not go begging the mens as you do 
The Ladies Good liking with a sly softness in 
Your looks, and a gentle slowness in your bows, 
As you pass by 'em -- as thus Sir -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Acts him.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Is not this like you?

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lady</font> Woodvil <font>and</font> Busy.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Mother Madam.

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Wood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah my Dear child <font>Harriet</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now is she so pleased with finding her agen
She cannot chide her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Wood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come away!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis now but high Mail Madam, the most entertaining 
Time of all the Evening.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would fain see that <font>Dorimant</font> Mother, you so 
Cry out of, for a monster, he's in the <font>Mail</font> 
I hear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Wood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come away then! the plague is here and you
Should dread the infection.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Y. Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may be misinform'd of the gentleman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Wood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh no! I hope you do not know him. 
He is the Prince of all the Devils in the Town,
Delights in nothing but in Rapes and Riots.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you did but hear him speak Madam!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Wood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! he has a Tongue they say would tempt the
Angels to a second fall.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Sir</font> Fopling <font>with his Equipage, six 
Footmen, and a Page</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hey, Champaine, Norman, La Rose, la Fleur,
La Tour, La Verdure. Dorimant --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Wood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, here he is among this Rout, he 
Names him; come away <font>Harriet</font> , come away.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex.</font> L. Wood. Harr. Busy <font>and</font> Y. Bell.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This fool's coming has spoil'd all, she's gone, 
But she has left a pleasing Image of her self 
Behind that wanders in my Soul -- 
It must not settle there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What resverie is this! speak man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dor.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Snatcht from my self how far behind
Already I behold the shore!</font>

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Medley.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dorimant</font> , a discovery! I met with <font>Bellair</font> .
<pagebreak id="49" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You can tell me no news Sir, I know all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you like the Daughter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You never came so near truth in your life, 
As you did in her description.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you of the Mother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What ever I think of her, she thinks 
Very well of me I find.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she know you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She did not, whether she does now or no I know not. 
Here was a pleasant Scene towards, when in came Sir
<font>Fopling</font> , mustering up his Equipage, and at the 
Latter end nam'd me, and frighted her away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Loveit</font> and <font>Bellinda</font> are not far off, I saw 
'em 
Alight at St. <font>James's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Fopling</font> hark you, a word or two,           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Whispers.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Look you do not want assurance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never do on these occassions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Walk on, we must not be seen together, make your
Advantage of what I have told you, the next turn 
You will meet the Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Fop.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hey -- Follow me all.                           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex. Sir</font> Fopl. <font>&amp; his Equipage</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Medly</font> , you shall see good sport anon between
<font>Loveit</font> and this <font>Fopling</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought there was something toward by that       
whisper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You know a worthy principle of hers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not to be so much as civil to a man who speaks to   
her 
In the presence of him she professes to love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have encourag'd <font>Fopling</font> to talk to her to    
night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now you are here she will go nigh to beat him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the humor she's in, her love will make her do   
some 
Very extravagant thing doubtless.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was <font>Bellindas</font> business with you at my
Lady <font>Townleys</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To get me to meet <font>Loveit</font> here in order to an 
<foreign>Eclercisme`nt</foreign> ; I made some difficulty of it, and have prepar'd 
This rancounter to make good my Jealousy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Med.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here they come!                                    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Lov. Bell. <font>and</font> Pert.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le meet her and provoke her with a deal of dumb
<pagebreak id="50" />
Civility in passing by, then turn short and be behind 
Her, when Sir <font>Fopling</font> sets upon her -- 
<font>See how unregarded now
That piece of Beauty passes</font> -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex.</font> Dor. <font>and</font> Med.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How wonderful respectfully he bow'd!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's alwayes over-mannerly when 
He has done a mischief.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methoughts indeed at the same time he had a 
Strange despising Countenance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The unlucky look he thinks becomes him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was afraid you would have spoke to him my Dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would have di'd first; he shall no more find me
The loving fool he has done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You love him still!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pert.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish you did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not, and I will have you think so: What made
You hale me to this odious place <font>Bellinda</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hate to be hulch'd up in a Coach; 
Walking is much better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would we could meet Sir <font>Fopling</font> now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord! would you not avoid him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would make him all the advances that may be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That would confirm <font>Dorimants</font> suspicion, my    
Dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is not jealous; but I will make him so, and be
Reveng'd a way he little thinks on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bellin.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she should make him         
jealous, that may make
Him fond of her again: I must disswade her from it. Lord! 
My Dear, this will certainly make him hate you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twill make him uneasie though he does not care
For me; I know the effects of jealousie on men of his 
Proud temper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a fantastick remedy, its operations are 
Dangerous and uncertain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Loveit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis the strongest Cordial we can give to dying 
Love, 
It often brings it back when there's no sign of life remaining: 
But I design not so much the reviving his, as my revenge.
