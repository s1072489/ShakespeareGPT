continue lame as shee had doone before, shee
woulde finde the meanes to knowe howe it
came, and y=t= shee woulde creepe vpon her knees
to complaine of them to haue iustice done vpon

any time.</nonSpeech>

in her bones, &amp; specially in her legges, at which
time y=e= said Vrsley came vnto her vnsent for and
w=t=out <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wout</comment> request: And said, she would helpe     
her of
her lamenes, if she the said Grace woulde giue

her xii. pence, y=e= which the said Grace speaking
her fayre, promised her so to doe, and thereupon
for the space of v. weekes after, she was wel &amp;
in good case as shee was before. And then
the said Vrsley came vnto the saide Grace, and
asked her y=e= money she promised to her. 
Wherupon the saide Grace made answere, that shee
was a poore and a needie woman, and had no
money: &amp; then the said Vrsley requested of her
cheese for it: but she said she had none. And shee
the said Vrsley, seeing nothing to be had of the
saide Grace, fell out with her, and saide, that she
woulde bee euen with her: and thereupon shee
was taken lame, and from that day to this day

   <nonSpeech>And she saith, that when she is any thing well
or beginneth to amend, then her childe is 
tormented, and so continueth for a time in a very

Then shee the saide Grace becommeth so lame,
as without helpe shee is not able to arise, or to

arise, &amp; this examinat saith, that sithence he with
others that presented her, and sithence she the
<pagebreak id="E7R" />
saide Annis talked with him, he hath had not so
fewe as twentie sheepe and lambes that haue
died, and be lame and like to die: &amp; hee saith, that
hee hath lost of his beasts &amp; other cattell, which

   <nonSpeech>Thomas Cartwrite saith, that after a great
winde &amp; snowe wel neere three yeeres sithence,
there was an arme of boughe of a tree of his
that was blowen downe, whereof Annis Herd
had remoued a peece and laid the same ouer a
wet or durtie place to goe ouer, which being to
this examinate vnknowen, hee tooke the same &amp;
the rest and carried it home: the which the saide
Annis knowing, that hee had carried the same
away, she said, that the churle (meaning this
examinat) to a neighbour of hers had carried
away the peece of the bough that she had laied to
go ouer, saying, that shee woulde bee euen with 
him for it. After which this Examinat saith,
within three nights after, there then beeing a
snowe two of his beasts went from all the rest,
where as they lay as he might well perceiue by
the snowe, and the head Cowe fell ouer a great
bancke into a ditch on the other side, and there
lay with the necke double vnder her, and the
head vnder the shoulder, but a liue, and he saith,
he gate it home by good helpe and laied it in his
barne, and saith, that it lay fourteene dayes in a 
<pagebreak id="E7V" />
groning and piteous sort, but of all that time
woulde eate nothing: whereupon hee saith hee
tooke an axe &amp; knocked it on the head. And
also the other Cowe that was with the said Cow
being a caluing in a most strange sorte died, the
which this examinat saith, y=t= hee verily thinketh
to be done by some witchery by the saide Annis
Herd.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Bennet Lane wife of William Lane, saith,
y=t= when she was a widdow, Annis Herd beeing
at her house she gaue her a pint of milke &amp; also
lent her a dish to beare it home, the which dishe
she kept a fortnight or 3. weekes, &amp; then y=e= girle
of the said Annis Herds came to her house on a
message: &amp; she asked the girle for the dish, &amp; said</nonSpeech><dialogue>
though I gaue thy mother milk to make her a 
posset I gaue her not my dish, </dialogue><nonSpeech>she this examinat
being then a spinning: &amp; so y=e= girle went home,
&amp; as it seemed told her mother, who by her sent
her dish home to her, y=e= which girle hauing done
her arrand, &amp; being but a while gone: shee this
examinat saith, she could no lo~ger spin nor make
a thread to hold, whereat she was so greeued y=t=
she could not spin, she saith, she tooke her spindle
and went to the grindstone therewith once or
twise, &amp; grownd it as smoth as she coulde,
thinking it might be by some ruggednesse of y=e=
spindle that did cause her thread to breake, and so
<pagebreak id="E8R" />
when she had grownd it as wel as she could, she
went againe to worke therewith, thinking that
then it would haue done, but it would not do no 
better then it did before: then she saith, y=t= shee
remembred her self and tooke her spindle and put
it into y=e= fire, &amp; made it red hot, &amp; then cooled it
gaine and went to worke, and then it wrought
as well as euer it did at any time before.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This examinat saith, that an other time the
saide Annis Herd owed her two pence, and
the time came that shee shoulde pay the Lordes
rent, and she beeing a poore woman was
constrained to aske her the two pence, and to borow
besides (as shee said): whereto she the saide 
Annis answered, that shee had paied eight or nine 
shillings that weeke, and shee had it not nowe:
saying she should haue it the next weeke, 
whereto shee this Examinat saide,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you must needes
helpe me with it now, for this day I must paye
the Lordes rent, </dialogue><nonSpeech>then shee saide shee must goe
borrowe it, and so went and fetched it, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
there is your money, </dialogue><nonSpeech>whereunto shee this
examinat answered, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> now I owe you a pint
of milke, come for it when you will &amp; you shall
haue it: </dialogue><nonSpeech>the which she came for y=e= next day, &amp; had
it with y=e= better, this examinat saith, y=t= y=e= next day
she would haue fleet hir milk bowle, but it wold
not abide y=e= fleeting, but would rop &amp; role as it were
<pagebreak id="E8V" />
the white of an egge, also the milk being on the
fier it did not so soone seath but it would quaile,
burne by and stincke, the which shee saide shee
thought might be lo~g of y=e= feeding of her beasts,
or els that her vessels were not sweete,
wherevpon she saith, she scalded her vessels, and
scoured them with salt, thinking that might helpe,
but it was neuer the better but as before: then
she saith, shee was full of care, that shee shoulde
loose both milke and creame, then shee saith it
came into her minde to approoue another way,
which was, shee tooke a horse shue and made it
redde hote, and put it into the milke in the 
vessals, and so into her creame: and then she saith,
shee coulde seath her milke, fleete her creame,
and make her butter in good sort as she had
before.</nonSpeech>

the~ he said vnto her,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Annis, thou art ill thought

<pagebreak id="F1V" />
to see in what strange case the pig was in, and
asked them what was best to doe therewith, to
which some of them said, burne it, other said, cut
of the eares &amp; burn them, and so they did, &amp; then
the pig amended by &amp; by. and within two daies
after this examinats wife met with the said
Annis Herd, and shee then burdened her with
that she had said to her boy: To the which y=e= said
Annis made answere, y=t= she did say so: and then
this examinats wife told the said Annis in what
case her pig was, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> thou saidest the other
day thou hadst no skill in witcherie, </dialogue><nonSpeech>his saide

she was full of care, saying, y=t= somtimes she put
one thing into her brewing fat, sometimes an

counsell to put a hot yron into her mesh fat, the
which she did, and then shee could brewe as well
as she did before.</nonSpeech>
