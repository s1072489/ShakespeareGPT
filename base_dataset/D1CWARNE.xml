</dialogue> <head>SCENE. 2.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Enter Menechmus talking backe to his
wife within.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>

If ye were not such a brabling foole and
mad-braine scold as yee are, yee would
neuer thus crosse your husbande in all
actions. Tis no matter, let her serue me
thus once more, Ile send her home to
her dad with a vengeance. I can neuer
go foorth a doores, but shee asketh mee
whither I go? what I do? what busines?
what I fetch? what I carry? * As though she were a 
Constable, or a tollgatherer. I haue pamperd her too much: she
hath seruants about her, wooll, flax, and all things necessary
to busie her withall, yet she watcheth &amp; wondreth whither
I go. Well sith it is so, she shall now haue some cause, I mean
to dine this day abroad with a sweet friend of mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea mary now comes hee to the point that prickes
me: this last speech gaules mee as much as it would doo his
wife; If he dine not at home, I am drest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We that haue Loues abroad, and wiues at home, 
are miserably hampred, yet would euery man could tame his
shrewe as well as I doo mine. I haue now filcht away a fine
ryding cloake of my wiues, which I meane to bestow vpon
one that I loue better. Nay, if she be so warie and watchfull
ouer me, I count it an almes deed to deceiue her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, what share haue I in that same?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out alas, I am taken.
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, but by your friend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, mine owne <font>Peniculus</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yours (ifaith) bodie and goods if I had any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why thou hast a bodie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, but neither goods nor good bodie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou couldst neuer come fitter in all thy life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush, I euer do so to my friends, I know how to    
come
alwaies in the nicke. Where dine ye to day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ile tell thee of a notable pranke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did the Cooke marre your meate in the 
dressing? Would I might see the reuersion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell me didst thou see a picture, how <font>Iupiters</font> 
Eagle 
snatcht away <font>Ganimede</font> , or how <font>Venus</font> stole away <font>Adonis</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Often, but what care I for shadowes, I want        
substance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Looke thee here, looke not I like such a picture?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O ho, what cloake haue ye got here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prethee say I am now a braue fellow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But hearke ye, where shall we dine?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush, say as I bid thee man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out of doubt ye are a fine man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What? canst adde nothing of thine owne?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ye are a most pleasant Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay not a word more, vnlesse ye tell mee how you 
and your wife be fallen out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I haue a greater secret then that to impart to
thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say your minde.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come farther this way from my house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, let me heare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay farther yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I warrant ye man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>* Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay yet farther.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis pittie ye were not made a water-man to row in  
a wherry.
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because ye go one way, and looke an other, stil    
least 
your wife should follow ye. But what's the matter, Ist not 
almost dinner time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seest thou this cloake?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not yet. Well what of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This same I meane to giue to <font>Erotium</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's well, but what of all this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There I meane to haue a delicious dinner prepard
for her and me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O sweet word. What, shall I knock presently at her 
doore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I knocke. But staie too <font>Peniculus</font> , let's not  
be too
rash. Oh see shee is in good time comming forth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, he now lookes against the Sun, how her beames 
dazell his eyes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter <font>Erotium.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Eroti.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What mine owne <font>Menechmus</font> , welcome sweete
heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what am I, welcome too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You sir? ye are out of the number of my welcome
guests.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>* Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am like a voluntary souldier, out of paie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Erotium</font> , I haue determined that here shal be  
pitcht 
a field this day; we meane to drinke for the heauens: And
which of vs performes the brauest seruice at his weopon the
wine boll, your selfe as Captaine shall paie him his wages 
according to his deserts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Agreed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would we had the weapons, for my valour pricks
me to the battaile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall I tell thee sweete mouse? I neuer looke vpon
thee, but I am quite out of loue with my wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eroti.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet yee cannot chuse, but yee must still weare
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
something of hers: whats this same?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This? such a spoyle (sweete heart) as I tooke from
her to put on thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ero.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mine owne <font>Menechmus</font> , well woorthie to bee my
deare, of all dearest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now she showes her selfe in her likenesse, when shee
findes him in the giuing vaine, she drawes close to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke <font>Hercules</font> got not the garter from      
<font>Hypolita</font> so hardly, as I got this from my wife. Take this, and   
with
the same, take my heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus they must do that are right Louers: especially
if they meane to beggers with any speed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I bought this same of late for my wife, it stood mee
(I thinke) in some ten pound
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Penicu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's tenne pounde bestowed verie 
thriftily.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Menechmus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But knowe yee what I woulde haue yee 
doo?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erotium</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It shall bee done, your dinner shall be 
readie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>* Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let a good dinner be made for vs three. Harke
ye, some oysters, a mary-bone pie or two, some artichockes,
and potato rootes, let our other dishes be as you please.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue a litle businesse in this Cittie, by that   
time
dinner will be prepared. Farewell till then, sweete <font>Erotium</font> :
Come <font>Peniculus</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I meane to follow yee: I will sooner leese my 
life, then fight of you till this dinner be done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Erotium.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who's there? Call mee <font>Cylindrus</font> the Cooke

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Cylindrus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>

<font>Cylindrus</font> , take the Hand-basket, and heere, there's
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
ten shillings is there not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis so mistresse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Buy mee of all the daintiest meates ye can get, ye
know what I meane: so as three may dine passing well, and
yet no more then inough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What guests haue ye to day mistresse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here will be <font>Menechmus</font> and his Parasite, and my
selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's ten persons in all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ten, for I warrant you, that Parasite may stand for
eight at his vittels.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Erot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go dispatch as I bid you, and looke ye returne with
all speed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will haue all readie with a trice.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
 <head>ACT. 2. SCEN. 1.</head> 
<nonSpeech>Enter <font>Menechmus</font> , <font>Sosicles</font> . <font>Messenio</font> his seruant,
and some Saylers.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely <font>Messenio</font> , I thinke Sea-fairers neuer   
take
so comfortable a ioy in any thing, as when they haue
bene long tost and turmoylde in the wide seas, they hap at
last to ken land.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ile be sworn, I shuld not be gladder to see a whole
Country of mine owne, then I haue bene at such a sight. But
I pray, wherfore are we now come to <font>Epidamnum</font> ? must we
needs go to see euerie Towne that we heare off?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Menech.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Till I finde my brother, all Townes are alike to
me: I must trie in all places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then let's euen as long as wee liue seeke your
brother: six yeares now haue we roamde about thus, <font>Istria,
Hispania, Massylia, Ilyria</font> , all the vpper sea, all high           
<font>Greece</font> ,
all Hauen Towns in <font>Italy</font> , I think if we had sought a needle
all this time, we must needs haue found it, had it bene aboue
ground. It cannot be that he is aliue, and to seek a dead man
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
thus among the liuing: what folly is it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, could I but once find any man that could
certainly enforme me of his death, I were satisfied; otherwise
I can neuer desist seeking: Litle knowest thou <font>Messenio</font> how
neare my heart it goes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is washing of a Blackamore. Faith let's goe
home, vnlesse ye meane we should write a storie of our
trauaile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirra, no more of these sawcie speeches, I         
perceiue I
much teach ye how to serue me, not to rule me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, so, now it appeares what it is to be a         
seruant. Wel
yet I must speake my conscience. Do ye heare sir? Faith I
must tell ye one thing, when I looke into the leane estate of
your purse, and consider aduisedly of your decaying stocke,
I hold it verie needfull to be drawing homeward, lest in
looking your brother, we quite lose our selues. For this assure
your selfe, this Towne <font>Epidamnum</font> , is a place of outragious
expences, exceeding in all ryot and lasciuiousnesse: and (I
heare) as full of Ribaulds, Parasites, Drunkards, Catchpoles,
Cony-catchers, and Sycophants, as it can hold: then for
Curtizans, why here's the currantest stamp of them in the world.
Ye must not thinke here to scape with as light cost as in
other places. The verie name shews the nature, no man comes 
hither <font> <foreign>sine damno</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yee say very well indeed: giue mee my purse into
mine owne keeping, because I will so be the safer, <font> <foreign>sine         
damno</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I feare you wil be busie among the 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: among the the</comment> 
Curtizans, &amp; so be cosened of it: then should I take great paines
in belabouring your shoulders, so to auoid both these harms,
Ile keep it my selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray do so sir, all the better.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter <font>Cylindrus</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
* I haue tickling geare here yfaith for their dinners: It 
grieues me to the heart to think how that cormorant knaue
<font>Peniculus</font> must haue his share in these daintie morsels But
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
what? Is <font>Menechmus</font> come alreadie, before I could come
from the Market? <font>Menechmus</font> how do ye sir? how haps it
ye come so soone?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Menech.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God a mercy my good friend, doest thou know
mee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Know ye? no not I. Where's mouldichappes that 
must dine with ye? A murrin on his manners.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whom meanest thou good fellow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why <font>Peniculus</font> worship, that whorson            
lick-trencher,
your Parasiticall attendant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Peniculus</font> ? what attendant? My Attendant?
Surely this fellow is mad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not I tell ye what cony-catching villaines yee
should finde here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Menechmus</font> , harke ye sir, ye come too soone    
backe
again to dinner, I am but returned from the Market.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fellow, here thou shalt haue money of me, goe get
the priest to sacrifice for thee. I know thou art mad, els thou
wouldst neuer vse a straunger thus?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas sir, <font>Cylindrus</font> was wont to be no stranger 
to you,
know ye not <font>Cylindrus</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Cylindrus</font> , or <font>Coliendrus</font> , or what the    
diuell thou art,
I know not, neither do I care to know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know you to be <font>Menechmus</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou shouldst be in thy wits, in that thou namest
me so right, but tell me, where hast thou knowne me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where? euen heere, where ye first fell in loue with
my mistresse <font>Erotium</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I neither haue Louer, neither knowe I who thou
art.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Know ye not who I am? who fils your cup &amp;
dresses your meate at our house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a slaue is this? that I had somewhat to breake
the Rascals pate withall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At your house, when as I neuer came in <font>Epidamnum</font>
till this day.
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh thats true. Do ye not dwell in yonder house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Foule shame light vpon them that dwell there, for
my part.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Questionlesse, hee is mad indeede, to curse himselfe
thus. Harke ye <font>Menechmus</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What saist thou?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I may aduise ye, ye shall bestow this money which
ye offred me, vpon a sacrifice for your selfe: for out of doubt
you are mad that curse your selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a verlet art thou to trouble vs thus?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush he wil many times iest with me thus. Yet when
his wife is not by, tis a ridiculous iest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat's that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This I say, Thinke ye I haue brought meate inough
for three of you? If not, ile fetche more for you and your
wench, and snatchcrust your Parasite.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Away Iack Napes, I say nothing to thee, for I know

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out drunken foole, without doubt thou art out of
thy wits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you shall see by the dressing of your meat. Go,
go, ye were better to go in and finde somewhat to do there,
whiles your dinner is making readie. Ile tell my mistresse ye

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is he gone? <font>Messenio</font> I think vppon thy words
alreadie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush marke I pray, Ile laie fortie pound here dwels
some Curtizan to whom this fellow belong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But <font>I</font> wonder how he knowes my name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh ile tell yee. These Courtizans assoone as anie
straunge shippe arriueth at the Hauen, they sende a boye
or a wench to enquire what they be, what their names be,
whence they come, wherefore they come, &amp;c. If they can by
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
any meanes strike acquaintance with him, or allure him to
their houses, he is their owne. We are here in a tickle place
maister, tis best to be circumspect.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I mislike not thy counsaile <font>Messenio</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, but follow it then. Soft, here comes somebodie
forth. Here sirs, Marriners, keep this same amongst you.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter <font>Erotium</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Let the doore stand so, away, it shall not be shut. Make
hast within there ho: maydes looke that all things be readie.
Couer the boord, put fire vnder the perfuming pannes, let all
things be very handsome. Where is hee, that <font>Cylindrus</font> sayd
stood without here? Oh, what meane you sweet heart, that
ye come not in? I trust you thinke your selfe more welcome
to this house then to your owne, and great reason why you
should do so. Your dinner &amp; all things are readie as you
willed. Will ye go sit downe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whom doth this woman speake to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ero.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Euen to you sir, to whom else should I speake?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlewoman ye are a straunger to me, and I
maruell at your speeches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ero.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea sir, but such a straunger, as I acknowledge ye 
for
my best and dearest friend, and well you haue deserued it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely <font>Messenio</font> , this woman is also mad or    
drunke,
that vseth all this kindnesse to mee vppon so small
acquaintance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mess.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush, did not I tell ye right? these be but leaues
which fall vpon you now, in comparison of the trees that wil

* Twentie yeares I thinke and more, haue I playde
the knaue, yet neuer playd I the foolish knaue as I
haue done this morning. I follow <font>Menechmus</font> , and he goes
to the Hall where now the Sessions are holden: there
thrusting our selues into the prease of people, when I was in
midst of all the throng, he gaue me the slip, that I could
neuer more set eye on him, and I dare sweare, came directly
to dinner. That I would he that first deuised these Sessions
were hang'd, and all that euer came of him: tis such a
hinderance to men that haue belly businesses in hand. If a man be
not there at his call, they amearce him with a vengeance.
Men that haue nothing else to do, that do neither bid anie
man, nor are themselues bidden to dinner, such should come
to Sessions, not we that haue these matters to looke too. If it
were so, I had not thus lost my dinner this day: which I think
in my conscience he did euen purposely couzen me off. Yet
I meane to go see: if I can but light vppon the reuersion, I
may perhaps get my peny-worthes. But how now? is this
<font>Menechmus</font> comming away from thence? dinner done, and
all dispacht? what execrable lucke haue I?

first ile harken awhile what he saith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good goddes, who euer had such lucke as I? Such

I am sure he is now flowting at me for the losse of my

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She tels me how I gaue it her, and stole it from my
wife. When I perceiued she was in an error, though I knew
not how, I began to sooth her, and to say euery thing as she
said. Meane while I far'd well, and that a free cost.

   Most foolishly was I ouerseene in giuing my purse and
money to <font>Messenio</font> , whom I can no where find, I feare
he is fallen into some lewd companie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I maruaile that my husband comes not yet, but see

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I muse where the knaue should be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will go ring a peale through both his eares for  
this
his dishonest behauiour. Oh sir, ye are welcome home with
your theeuery on your shoulders, are ye not ashamde to let
all the world see and speake of your lewdnesse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now? what lackes this woman?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neuer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because she did as you do now, on whom soeuer she
met withall, she railed, and therfore well deserued that
dogged name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These foule abuses and contumelies, I can neuer 
endure, nay rather will I liue a widowes life to my dying day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What care I whether thou liuest as a widow or as a
wife. This passeth, that I meet with none but thus they vexe
me with straunge speeches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What straunge speeches? I say I will surely liue a 
widowes life, rather then suffer thy vile dealings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prethee for my part, liue a widow till the worldes
end, if thou wilt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mulier.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Euen now thou deniedst that thou stolest it from

with stealing of this cloake, which this day an other gaue me

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I will first complaine to my father. Ho boy,
who is within there? <font>Vecio</font> go runne quickly to my father,

* Though bearing so great a burthen, as olde age, I can
make no great haste, yet as I can, I will goe to my daughter,
who I know hath some earnest businesse with me, that shee
sends in such haste, not telling the cause why I should come.
But I durst laie a wager, I can gesse neare the matter: I
suppose it is some brabble between her husband and her. These
yoong women that bring great dowries to their husbands,
are so masterfull and obstinate, that they will haue their own
wils in euerie thing, and make men seruants to their weake
affections. And yoong men too, <font>I</font> must needs say, be naught
now a dayes. Well ile go see, but yonder mee thinks stands
<pagebreak id="D3V" />
my daughter, and her husband too. Oh tis euen as I gessed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mulier.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Father ye are welcome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now daughter? What? is all well? why is your
husband so sad? haue ye bin chiding? tell me, vvhich of you
is in the fault?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> First father know, that I haue not any way
misbehaued my selfe, but the truth is, I can by no meanes endure
this bad man to die for it: and therefore desire you to take
me home to you againe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is the matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He makes me a stale and a laughing stocke to all the
world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who doth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This good husband here, to whom you married me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> See, see, how oft haue I warned you of falling out
with your husband?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot auoid it, if he doth so fowly abuse me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I alwaies told ye, you must beare with him, ye must
let him alone, ye must not watch him, nor dog him, nor
meddle with his courses in any sort.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mulier.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee hauntes naughtie harlottes vnder my
nose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee is the wiser, because hee cannot bee quiet at
home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mulier.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There hee feastes and bancquets, and spendes
and spoiles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wold ye haue your husband serue ye as your drudge?
Ye will not let him make merry, nor entertaine his friendes
at home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Father will ye take his part in these abuses, and
forsake me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so daughter, but if I see cause, I wil as well 
tel him
of his dutie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I vvould I vvere gone from this prating father and
daughter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hitherto I see not but hee keepes ye vvell, ye vvant
<pagebreak id="D4R" />
nothing, apparrell, mony, seruants, meate, drinke, all thinges
necessarie: I feare there is fault in you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But he filcheth away my apparrell and my iewels, to
giue to his Trulles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he doth so, tis verie ill done, if not, you doo 
ill to
say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may beleeue me father, for there you may see
my cloake which now he hath fetcht home againe, and my
chaine which he stole from me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now will <font>I</font> goe talke with him to knowe the     
truth.
Tell me <font>Menechmus</font> , how is it, that I heare such disorder in 
your life? Why are ye so sad man? wherein hath your wife
offended you?

<font>Iobe</font> ,
and by all the Gods <font>I</font> sweare vnto you, whatsoeuer this
woman here accuseth mee to haue stolne from her, it is vtterly
false and vntrue, and if I euer set foote within her doores, <font>I</font>
wishe the greatest miserie in the worlde to light vppon
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why fond man, art thou mad to deny that thou euer
setst foote within thine owne house where thou dwellest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do <font>I</font> dwell in that house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doest thou denie it?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Menechmus</font> , I pray leaue this fondnesse, ye    
iest too
peruersly with your friends.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good old father, what I pray haue you to do with
me? or why should this woman thus trouble me, with whom
I haue no dealings in the world?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Father, marke I pray how his eies sparkle, they    
rowle
in his head, his colour goes and comes, he lookes wildly.
See, see.
<pagebreak id="D4V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What? they say now I am mad, the best way for me
is to faine my selfe mad indeed, so I shall be rid of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Looke how he stares about, now he gapes.

hunt in the woods with you, I see, I heare, I come, I flie, but
I cannot get out of these fields. Here is an old mastiffe bitch

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What if I fetch my folkes hither, and haue him
carried in before he do any harme.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now? they will carry mee in if I looke not to

bid me <font>Phoebus</font> , to teare this dog in peeces with my nayles?
if I laie hold on him, I will do thy commandment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Get thee into thy house daughter, away quickly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is gone: yea <font>Appollo</font> I will sacrifice this

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come not neare me sirra.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea I will quarter him, and pull all the bones out

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sure I am sore afraid he will do some hurt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Men.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Many things thou commandest me <font>Appollo</font> , wouldst
