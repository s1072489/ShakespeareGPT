 <head> <font>I.</font> DIALOGUE.

ABOUT ASKING THE WAY;

BETWIXT A FRENCH TRAVELLOUR, AND
A COUNTRYMAN HE MEETS UPON
THE ROAD.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Honest Man.
   Is this the Way to 
London?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   You are out of your way.
<pagebreak id="46" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half a Mile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must I then go back
again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis your best way.
   And, when you come to such a
Place, turn on your Right
Hand.
   Go on that way, and you can't go 
amiss.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must I turn neither to the 
right Hand, nor the left?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all. Go strait
forwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank you heartily.
   I am much obliged to you.
   But, pray, how many miles do you
reckon it thither?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Five Miles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No more?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half a Mile hence you will
be in sight of the Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So much the better.
   It joys me already to think on't.

</dialogue> <head> <font>A DIALOGUE</font> ,

TO LIE IN AN INN.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Boy.
   Take my Horse.
   Put him in the Stable.
   Take care of him.
   Rub him well.
   Give him some Oats.
   A whole Peck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I shall take a special
care of your Horse.
   Do not trouble your self about it.
<pagebreak id="47" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is the Landlady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d' ye want, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any thing to 
eat?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What have ye?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you for Fowls, or for
Butchers Meat?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Fowls have ye?
   Let me see.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look ye, Sir.
   Here's a good Pheasant.
   Those are very fat Partridges.
   If you want a Dish of Larks,
here is Larks.
   If you had rather young Pigeons,
there be choice ones.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. I had rather have one
of those Partridges.
   How much must I pay for't?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must pay half a Crown
for it, when 'tis dressed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis too much.
   You must take two shillings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It cost me near upon what
you bid me for it.
   Partridges are scarce at this time
of the Year.
   'Tis hard to get any at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then let it be presently laid 
on the Spit.
   Make a good Sauce to it.
   And, pray, let it be done with all
speed, for I am ready to starve.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall have it
presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you alone, or have you
<pagebreak id="48" />
Company with ye?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you got a Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not yet.
   I am but just come in.
   Pray, give orders that I may have
a good Chamber.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall have a very
neat Room, a good Bed, and clean
Sheets.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well. But when the
Maid has made the Bed, she
must warm it well with a Pan
full of Coals.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, the Sheets are very
dry, and it is now sweltry
Weather.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis no matter. I do it for 
my Health.
   Your Beds are Hackney Beds, and
apt to be infected.
   Now the Heat draws out all the
Malignancy of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Sir, you shall have
every thing done to your
satisfaction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is my Supper ready?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twill be ready
presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then let the Cloth be
laid.
   Bring me a Penny-roll.
   A Quart of Ale, and a Pint of
Wine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Wine will ye please
to have?
   White, or Claret?
<pagebreak id="49" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which is best?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are both very good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Draw me then a Pint of
Claret, the best you have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So I will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Wine is not natural.
   This is sophisticated Wine.
   I cannot drink it.
   It makes me sick already.
   Have you none better?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, that Wine go's for the 
best in Town.
   You are the first that ever found
fault with it.
   There's no mixture in the least,
I assure you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a pretty Man, to
make me believe I have no skill
in Wine.
   Bring me a bit of Cheese.
   And some Fruit, if you have any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall have it
presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take away.
   Take care of my Things.
   Awake me to morrow by five a
clock.
   Now I think on't, where is the
Landlord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is at home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do's he understand French?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, tell him, I desire his
company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall be sure to tell him,
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stay a little.
<pagebreak id="50" />
   See if there be a Chamber-pot
under the Bed.
   There is one.
   That's well.
   Remember to awake me to
morrow by break of day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who's there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis I, Sir.
   Tis five a clock.
   It struck five just now.
   I am going to rise.
   Bid the Hostler to saddle my
Horse.
   Bid him get it ready.
   Bring me some Water in a Bason,
and a Towel withal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will ye be pleased to eat
any thing before you go?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I could eat a couple of
boiled Eggs.
   When you bring them, bring the
Reckoning too.
   What's to pay?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is so much.
   For the Partridge, half a Crown.
   A peny Roll.
   Two pence for Ale.
   A Pint of Wine, six Pence.
   The Fruit, three Pence.
   The Bed six Pence.
   In all, four Shillings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And for my Horse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's a thing by it self.
   The Hostler will tell you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, there's your
Reckoning.
   And six Pence for you.
<pagebreak id="51" /> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I humbly thank ye.
   I wish you a happy Journey.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell the Hostler, that I am
ready, and bid him get my Horse
out of the Stable.
   Well, honest Man, what must I 
pay for my Horse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sixteen pence, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's eighteen Pence,
keep the Two-pence for your
self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank ye, Sir.

</dialogue> <head> <font>A DIALOGUE</font> ,

ABOUT TAKING A LODGING.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you, Madam, any
Rooms to let?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I have one, two pair
of Stairs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forwards, or backwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Backwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you be pleased to let
me see it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, if you please to
give your self the trouble to come
up.
   This is a good Stair-case.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is pretty lightsom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you be pleased to step
in, Sir.
   This is the Room.
   Tis a very fine Chamber, well
furnished, and very convenient,
<pagebreak id="52" />
   There is a little Closet to put
Things out of the way.
   Here is another larger, with a
good light, and very fit for a 
Schollar.
   The Feather-bed is very good,
and the Furniture very neat.
   Here you have a Table, a couple
of Stands, and a Looking-glass.
   The Maid shall make clean your 
Shoos.
   Every Morning she shall bring you
a Bason of Water, and give
you from time to time such
attendance, as you can reasonably
expect.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So far, Madam, all is very
well.
   But the Room is two Stories high.
   That's an Inconveniency.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis according as People
fancy.
   In my Judgment, the Air ought to
be better and clearer, than in
the first Story.
   I am sure of one thing, that here
is a far better Prospect.
   Do but take a View, Sir, of that
large extent of Country which
is seen from hence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say, Madam, but
that the Room is convenient
enough.
   The Rate is the thing we must now
go upon.
   Therefore, pray, tell me the
lowest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How would you take it, Sir,
By the Quarter, by the Month, or
by the Week?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By the Week.
<pagebreak id="53" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you must pay five
Shillings a Week.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed 'tis too much.
   But I won't be much out of the
way, I offer you fairly four
Shillings. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis too little.
   I have had six Shillings a Week
for this Room.
   And I cannot part with it under
five.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le tell you, Madam, what
we shall do, if you please.
   We shall part the odd shilling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, Sir, you are too
hard.
   D' ye intend to lie here to night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you please to get the Room 
ready.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I'le go fetch my Things,
and I shall be back again within
an hour at farthest.
   But first I must know the Name
of the Street.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Street is called...
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what Sign is this that
hangs here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Paradise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A good Omen, I hope. I
please my self with this lucky
hit.

</dialogue> <head> <font>A DIALOGUE</font> ,

BETWEEN THE TRAVELLOUR AND THE
COACHMAN.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I come to fetch my
Things away.
   I took a Chamber in 
<font>Covent-Garden</font> .
   Let's see what I ow here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis but a small matter.
   There's but ten Pence to pay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, give me the rest.
   Do so much as call a Coach.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's one over the way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Coachman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Turn your Coach.
   Take in this Portmantle.
   Open the Door.
   Carry me to Paradise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To Paradise, Sir.
   There is no Coach-way thither.
   And, to tell you the truth on't, I
am not at all acquainted with
that Road.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I know the way to Hell
very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't question it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you please to go thither,
'tis at <font>Westminster</font> .
   I shall carry you thither with a
full gallop.
   As we go along you may take a
view of the Devil in
<font>Fleet-street</font> , near <font>Temple-bar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God forbid, thou wretched
Charon.
<pagebreak id="55" />
   Carry me to <font>Covent-Garden</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell me then the Name of
the Street.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go strait to the Garden.
   There I'le shew you what Place 
we must go to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis well enough.
   Sir, we are at the Garden.
   Which way must I go now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go into the Street which is
just over against us.
   And, when I bid you stop, be sure 
to stop.
   Hold, hold, this is the Place.
   How much must thou have?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Shilling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shillings run faster than
Coaches in this Town.

</dialogue> <head> <font>A DIALOGUE</font> ,

BETWEEN THE TRAVELLOUR AND HIS
LANDLADY.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you are very
welcome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I am your most
humble Servant.
   Well! is all ready now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Maid is above imployed
about your Room.
   I'le go and bid her make haste.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>H.</font> </comment> By no means, Madam.
   Don't give your self that trouble.
   I am in no haste.
   I can stay a little.
   Provided you will be troubled 
with my Company.
<pagebreak id="56" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir, step then into
this Parlour.
   Will you be pleased to sit down?
   Let us sit down, if you please.
   How long, Sir, have you been come
to London?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came last night about
twelve a clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis likely then that you
came by Water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From Dover I came Post
as far as Gravesend, and from
Gravesend by Water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Thames is very
pleasant at this time of the Year.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it is.
   The truth on't is, 'tis a very fine
River.
   And I admired, as I came along,
that infinite Number of Ships
that rid upon the River as far
as London-Bridge.
   You would take it, at a distance,
for a great Forest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis an undoubted
Argument of the great Trading of this
Place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a Gulf of Commerce.
   Every where you see scarce any
thing but Store-houses, Shops,
and Commodities.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mary</font> , is the Gentleman's 
Chamber ready?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Madam, all is 
ready.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Carry up that Portmantle.

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's your Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Name is <font>Mary</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then, <font>Mary</font> , you must give
your self the trouble to warm my
Bed very well.
   Reach me those Slippers.
   Take my Shoos, and make 'em 
clean to night.
   For I intend to go out to morrow
morning early.
   Be sure to bring me a Bason of
Water, and a Towel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Towel hangs in that
Corner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's very well.
   What time do you rise?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By break of day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And your Mistress, what
time do's she commonly rise?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At seven a clock.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is she married, or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is a Widow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long has she been so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These two years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was her Husband?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Sword-man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has he left any Estate?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has left his Wife this
House ready furnished, and a
competent Estate in the Countrey,
which she lives handsomly upon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has she any Children?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She had some.
<pagebreak id="58" />
   But they are all dead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She seems to be a well-born
Gentlewoman.
   And I look upon her as an
ingenious Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is so, I assure ye; but
her good Nature and Breeding go's
beyond all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not doubt it in the least,
and I think my self happy to be
under her Roof.
   But, hark ye, <font>Mary</font> , is the House
full of Lodgers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is now but one Room
empty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Lodgers are they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very civil People.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you been a
Servant here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Near upon five years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a great while.
   But I forget my self.
   Pray, go fetch the Warming-pan.
   I'le go to bed e're it be long.
   For I did not sleep a wink all last
night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, your Bed is warm

   Have you any thing else to 
command me?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know an honest and
good Washer-woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I know one that washes
very well, and at a reasonable
rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, send for her.
   For my Linnen is almost all foul.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le step to her my self.
   She lives here hard by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bring her then along with
you, if you can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, here is the 
Washer-woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bid her come in.
   Good Woman, I have here a stock
of foul Linnen.
   What shall I give you to wash it?
   You must be very reasonable.
   Otherwise I shall pitch upon 
another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, we must see the Pieces.
<pagebreak id="60" />
   And I shall tell you my Rates.
   A night-Shirt, is Two pence.
   A fine Shirt, six Pence.
   A Lace-Cravat, with Ruffles, 
four Pence.
   A plain Cravat, with Ruffles, 
Two-pence.
   The Socks, a Penny a Pair.
   And a Handkerchief, 
Half-peny.
   That is my lowest Rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I am willing to give
you what you ask.
   But I expect to have my Linnen
very well washed.
   Pray, do it with great care, for I
am a little nice in that
particular.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you will have no cause
to complain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell the Pieces, and I shall
set them down.
   See now whether I have the right
Number.
   Whilst I read, do you tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis all right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, see you tear nothing.
   But above all, take care you don't
change my Linnen.
   You see how 'tis all marked.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, trouble not your self in
the least about it.
   All will be well on my side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very good, we shall quickly
see what you mean by it.
<pagebreak id="61" />
   But, pray, when shall I expect my
Linnen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have it 
Saturday-night at furthest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't fail me then.
   I shall stay for it.

</dialogue> <head>THE WASHER-WOMAN'S
CHEAT.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mary</font> , has the 
Washer-woman brought my
Linnen home?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! dear Sir, I am loth
to tell you of the Misfortune which
is befaln you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d' ye mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That base Jade, your 
Washer-woman, has given us all the slip.
   She has carried away with her all
the Linnen she could take and
scrape.
   Yours is amongst all the rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, now I am finely
brought to bed.
   I am curiously put to it.
   Now I may go to bed without a 
Shift, and blow my Nose with
my Fingers.
   I am undone, if I must buy a new
stock of Linnen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you sport your self
ingeniously with your Loss.
   And I am much mistaken, if I
don't take it more to heart than
your own self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! the unlucky Jade,
she knew what she meant, when
<pagebreak id="62" />
she told me all would be well on
her side.
   That Expression bred presently
some Suspicion within me.
   But I deceived my self, when I
went about to undeceive my self.
   However, I must take patience.
   Provided my Linnen be neither
changed, nor torn, I am
contented.
   Those two Things I strictly charged
her with.
   When all comes to all, I save the
Washing however.
   A Peny saved, is a Peny got.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I admire how
cunningly you turn off the Point of your
Misfortune.
   And you put me in mind of a great
Artist; who, to save Candle,
would never work in the
Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When all is done, <font>Mary</font> , I
must think of providing my self
with Linnen.
   Therefore you must direct me to
some place or other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you will find
Seamstresse's Shops enough.
   Your business is only to cheapen as
well as you can.

ABOUT BUYING OF LINNEN.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d' ye want,
Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lace-Cravats.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, Sir, take your choice,
there you have several fashions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But where be the Ruffles?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here they are.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will be but reasonable,
I shall take a couple of Cravats,
with the Ruffles to 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall find me as
reasonable as any Seamstress in
Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shew me then a Cravat of
another fashion, and yet
fashionable too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a delicate one, and
I think very fit for your turn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell me your last word for
these two Cravats, with the 
Ruffles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you must give me three
Pounds.
   The Lace is extraordinary fine.
   I cannot sell them under.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You exact upon me,
Madam.
   What? thirty Shillings a Cravat
and Ruffles.
   'Tis an unreasonable Rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you don't know what
they stand me in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare say you would be loth
<pagebreak id="64" />
I should know.
   Have you any good Night-shirts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I have Shirts of
several Prices.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shew me some of the best, 
and the finest you have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d' ye think, Sir, of
these?
   They are special ones, and of a 
fine length and breadth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are they long enough for
me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Long enough, I warrant 
you.
   And almost too wide.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks the Cloth is not
very fine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fine enough, Sir, for
Night-shirts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell me then your Price.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are eight Shillings a
Piece.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed you are too dear.
   You exact.
   You ask too much for your
Commodities.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you are under a
Mistake.
   I ask you within compass.
   Sure you will allow one some
Profit to live by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis but reasonable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I want besides, Sleeves,
Socks, Handkerchiefs,
Night-Caps.
   Shew me some, if you please
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, Sir, delicate Sleeves
<pagebreak id="65" />
of pure Cloth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But of a mad Price
without doubt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Eight Shillings a pair, and
no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really I was afraid you
would have said twelve.
   Let me see those Socks.
   I fear they are too little for me.
   Have you none bigger?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These, Sir, will fit you to
a hair's breadth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's the Price?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Six pence a Pair.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And these Handkerchiefs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Shillings a Piece.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lay 'em aside.
   These Caps, Madam, how much
do you sell 'em?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Half a Crown is the Price.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very good. Now let us see
what the whole will amount to, by 
my Reckoning.
   For the two Lace-Cravats and
Ruffles I'le give you fifty
Shillings.
   Not a Sous more, Mistress.
   For four Night-shirts, at six
Shillings a piece at the most, four
and twenty Shillings.
   Fifty and twenty four, is 
three-score and fourteen Shillings,
which is (I think) three
Pounds fourteen Shillings.
<pagebreak id="66" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right. But all this while,
Sir, you reckon without your Host.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis no matter. Let us
proceed.
   So the two Cravats, Ruffles,
and Night-shirts come to three
Pounds fourteen Shillings.
   Let us put by the three Pounds,
and take up the Shillings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I must reckon for
the Socks, Handkerchiefs, and
Night-caps.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Six pair of Socks, at
Six-pence a pair, come to three
Shillings.
   Six Handkerchiefs, at 
Twenty-pence a piece, make up ten
Shillings.
   And three Night-caps, at two
Shillings a piece, amount to
six Shillings.
   Fourteen and three is seventeen,
seventeen and ten is seven
and twenty, seven and twenty
and six is three and thirty.
   Three and thirty Shillings is one
Pound thirteen Shillings.
   To which add the three Pounds,
and the whole amounts just to
four Pounds thirteen Shillings.
   Is not it right, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, 'tis right at your own
Rates, but that won't do my
business.
   You must give me, in a word, five
Pounds.
   It is a compleat Sum.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Madam.
<pagebreak id="67" />
   But, to let you see how reasonable
I am, I am willing to give
you four Pounds fifteen
Shillings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my word, 'tis too little.
   And yet I must yield to it against 
the grain, that I may get your
Custom.
   Take 'em, Sir, and remember
that you have 'em Dog-cheap.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell that Mony, Madam, 
and remember that you have
almost ruined me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God forbid. I should be very
sorry for't.
   Sir, shall I send these Things to
your Lodgings?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am going strait home.
   If you please to send any body with
them, we shall go together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's my Apprentice, that
shall wait upon ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well. Follow me,
Sweet-heart.

TO GET A SUTE MADE.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Honest Man, I have occasion
for a new Sute of Clothes.
   But I must have it very neat, and 
fashionable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you have it of Cloth,
or Stuff?
<pagebreak id="68" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am willing to have it of 
Cloth.
   The Winter draws near, and
English Cloth is much in the 
vogue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, shall I shew you some
Patterns?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any about you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir. Pray, see which
you like best.
   If you be for a fine Cloth, and a 
good Colour, this will do your
Business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's the Price of this
Cloth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Eighteen Shillings a Yard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d' ye call a Yard?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Measure three foot long,
which is the common Measure in 
England.
   'Tis less than the French Ell by
one part in five.
   That is, there must be a Yard and
a quarter, to make up a French 
Ell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At this rate, how many
Yards must I have for a Sute?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, for a person of your
Pitch, there must be no less than
three Yards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Eighteen and eighteen is
thirty six, and eighteen to that, 
is just four and fifty.
   So the Cloth alone will stand me
in four and fifty Shillings.
<pagebreak id="69" />
   'Tis a great deal of Money.
   But why must I have three 
Yards?
   In France I never took above two
Ells of Cloth for a Sute.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, they wear now their
Coats very wide at the Pockets, 
and that takes up a great deal of
Cloth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then we must take up three
Yards.
   Where lives your Draper?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here hard by, in
<font>Covent-Garden</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stay a little, and I shall
go along with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Master ... shew us some
Cloth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you have it fine?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Gentleman likes this 
Pattern.
   Let's see the Piece.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Cloth is very fine
indeed, and lasting.
   Here's the Piece.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Cloth is well enough.
   Do but tell us the Price.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, 'tis very well worth
twenty Shillings a Yard.
   But, to be short with ye, I will
have but eighteen.
   That's the Price on't, I will not
bate a Farthing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must give it for
sixteen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I should lose by it at
that Rate.
<pagebreak id="70" />
   That is not the way to live.
   I assure you, at the rate I offer it
for, I get but one Shilling a 
Yard.
   That's little enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wonder how Tradesmen
get Estates.
   By their Discourse, they are most
an end Losers.
   If they get, 'tis so small a matter,
that it is scarce worth their
while to keep Shop.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas! Sir, Trading is
come to nothing.
   It is not now as it has been
formerly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, well. We understand
pretty well your meaning.
   Measure me three Yards of this
Cloth.
   And be sure to give good Measure, 
though it were but for the
Taylor's Profit.
   Tell that Money.
   I take it to be right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is so.
   Sir, I thank ye.
   I hope you will come hither another
time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sure enough I shall come,
either with Thanks, or Reproaches.
   Tis according as the Cloth shall
prove.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I am so well satisfied
with the goodness of the Cloth,
that I have no cause in the least to
fear your Complaints.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish it be so.
<pagebreak id="71" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Honest Man you must come
back along with me, to take my
Measure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Lining, Sir, will you
have?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must have the Coat lined 
with a good Silk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must I find it for ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall find the Lining,

   I leave all to your Discretion.
   Do as you shall think fit.
   When you bring home my Sute, you
shall have your Money.
   But you must be reasonable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I shall make it my
business to please you upon all
accounts.
   But, to be the more sure of it, I
should be glad to know first
what sort of Button you would
have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Plain Silk-buttons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are not for a Vest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. I never wear any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When must you have your
Sute, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As soon as possible.
   You see what case I am in.
   I have but this travelling-Sute.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall have it two
days hence.
<pagebreak id="72" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take three days rather than 
fail.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I dare undertake to

   This is too big for me.
   That is not fine enough.

   Pray, try it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do's it become me well?
   Methinks the Brims are a little

   The Crown is handsom enough.
   But I don't find it well wrought.

service.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d' ye ask for't?

   I offer you fifty Shillings.
   See, if you can afford it at that
rate
   For my part, I'le give no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, Sir, 'tis too little.
   Take it for four and fifty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What I said is said.
   I neither go backwards nor
forwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you must ow me four

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, here is a pretty
Stock of Perwigs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shew me a light one, well
made, and of a good strong Hair.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you have it, Sir, very
long?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of a middle Size.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I think this Perwig
will go near to please ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis something too long,
methinks.
   The Curl is not good.
   Neither do I find it thick enough of
Hair.
   And, pray, would you make me
believe this to be a good Hair?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis as good Hair as any is in
England.
   Upon my word, I pay dear for it.
   Do but handle 'em a little, 'tis a
strong Hair.
   As for the Curl, there is no better 
Curl.
   If you find the Perwig too thin of

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But don't you find it your
self somewhat too long?
<pagebreak id="75" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Far from that, Sir, for a
person of your presence, I should
rather think it too short.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well. What's the Price of
it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall have it for
three Pounds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope, my Friend, to have
it cheaper than so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I can bate no great
matter of it.
   The Perwig is a good and genteel
Perwig, and the Price very
reasonable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I should give ye fifty
Shillings for it, I should think it 
very well paid.
   Perwigs are not now so dear as
they have been.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, here is one of fifty
Shillings. 
   Do but see the difference.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a Perwig worth 
about five and thirty.
   I should be loth to give any more
for it.
   To make no more words, shall I
tell you fifty Shillings for the
other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you please, Sir, to tell me
eight and fifty Shillings, you shall
have it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I find you and I are not like
to clap up a Bargain.
   We keep too great a distance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take it then for five and 
fifty.
   I can bate nothing on't.
<pagebreak id="76" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it be so, I take my leave
of you.
   I shall try somewhere else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Sir.
   Consider well the goodness of this
Perwig.
   Assure your self, that you will find
none better of that Price any
where else.
   Take it for half a Crown more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not a Farthing more.
   I am fully resolved upon it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my word, you have it
too cheap.

 <head>OF THE AIR OF ENGLAND,
AND ITS INFLUENCES.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>England</font> is a strange
Country. See what a 
Fog there is abroad.
   It puts me in mind 
of the Egyptian Darkness.
   One is like to be lost in it.
   Let's have a Saw, and we 
will saw it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Truth on't is, 'tis a 
dismal Fog.
<pagebreak id="88" />
   And it is so very thick, that I
don't remember I ever saw the
like in England.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay. But you cannot deny
me, that ever since the beginning 
of Winter few Days went over
our Heads without some Mist or
other, Morning or Evening.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis true. And I confess, the
Sun is pretty rare here in
Winter-time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis at least ten Days since
the last time I saw it. Do's it
appear? 'tis but a transient
Appearance for a moment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He imitates those Monarchs
of the East, who, to make
themselves to be the more respected by
their People, appear but seldom
abroad.
   Don't you know the Story that
go's about, of a Spanish
Embassadour, who was sent to King <font>James</font>
I. at his first coming to the Crown 
of England?
   Tis said, he was here a whole
Month, and went away, not
having had so much as once a sight
of the Sun all that while.
   At his departure he desired
such Courtiers as waited on him
to Ship-board, to remember his
most humble Service to the King
their Master, and to the Sun
when they should chance to see it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was a pretty Joke
indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, in the very Summer
'tis no common Thing here to see
a clear and serene Sky.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What should be the reason
of that?
<pagebreak id="89" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sea is the Cause of
it, from whence the Sun draws
thick Vapours, which condensing
themselves into Clouds, keep us
so often from the sight of that
glorious Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus from the Premises we
may draw this general Conclusion,
that the Air of England is gross
and thick; that the Weather here
is commonly over-cast, gloomy, and
melancholy; subject to Rain, and
Fogs, in Winter especially.
   So that, when it is cold
Weather in England, it is not (as in
Continents) a hard Frost, but
for the most part a raw kind of
Cold, not wholesom to be sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is not all. There is
another Inconveniency in the
Weather here, I mean its 
Changeableness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le tell you thereupon an
Observation, which I lately made.
   In the space of 24 hours, there
hapned to be four sorts of
Weather, which had very well suted
the four Seasons of the Year.
   The Morning-weather had been
proper for a Spring-day.
   Towards Noon it was hot
enough for an England Summer.
   About Evening the Sky was
over-cast, as it uses to be in 
Autumn.
   And in the Night there fell a
very cold Rain.
<pagebreak id="90" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess, I made 
sometimes that Observation my self,
but this is such a Thing as happens
but seldom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But don't you find however,
that one is very apt to catch Cold
here, especially in Winter.
   This doubtless does proceed
from the Changeableness of the
Weather.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis true, Colds are very
rife in this Country.
   Nay, the Consequences of it
prove sometimes fatal to tender
Constitutions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you believe the
Consumption do's often proceed from
thence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Thing is likely
enough.
   And to prevent that mortal
Disease, 'tis good to keep his
Breast chiefly, the Head, and the
Feet warm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks Feavers are not
altogether so common here, as in
France.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No more they are not. And
therefore hard Drinking is the less
dangerous here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay. But 'tis said on the
other side, that there is more
danger in the secret Commerce with
Woman-kind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Therefore look to your hits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hitherto I must confess we
have made the worst of England.
<pagebreak id="91" /> 
   It behoves us to speak within
bounds, and for me to tell you
that, though this Country be
something troubled with Rain, and
cloudy Weather, yet those
Disadvantages are highly countervailed
by the Sweetness and Comforts of
it.
   Whilst the Sun scorches the
Plants, and the Inhabitants of
the Southern Country's, by the
reflexion of its Beams, it do's but
warm England by a moderate
Heat, which makes it the more
plentiful in Corn and Pasturage.
   The Noise of Thunder is but
seldom heard here, and the 
Heavens darting of Thunder-bolts is
a Thing unfrequent in this
Country.
   Hail is not fatal here to Plants,
as elsewhere.
   And, instead of those
impetuous Showrs of Rain, which often
drown the fairest Hopes of the
Husbandman in hot Climes, here
is commonly nothing but small
Rain to be seen.
   Admirable is besides the
Sweetness of this Country, in that
it is not subject to Hurricanes, nor
Earthquakes; that it do's not
breed many venomous Beasts;
and that the Cattel feed Day and 
Night in the open Field, free from
any fear of the Wolf.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it really true, that there
are no Wolves in England?
<pagebreak id="92" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis true, Historians tell us
there is none. Nay, there are
those who attribute it to a
peculiar Vertue of the English Air, as
if it were mortal to that Creature.
   Others tell us more probably, 
that England was unpeopled of
Wolves by the Care of one of its
Kings; who by a happy
Contrivance exchanged the Tribute paid
him in Gold and Silver by the
Welsh for a yearly Tribute of 300
Wolves Skins.
   Which made that People (as
History tells us) so extream
industrious and active in
Wolf-hunting, that they cleared the
Country from those noxious
Beasts, and thereby eased 
themselves of their burdensom
Tribute.
   For my part, I am apt to think,
that the Race of English Wolves
might be in a manner extinct by
this means. However they were
not so totally routed, but that
there are some now and then to 
be seen.
   The Sight is rare, I confess,
and England being an open
Country, is the more unfit to shelter
such a Creature.
   And so let us resume the thread
of our Discourse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think ye, Friend, of
the last Winter?
<pagebreak id="93" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was pretty mild.
   The Frost do's not last long
here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet England lies North
of France, London being nearer 
the Pole than Paris, by four
Degrees.
   However 'tis certain, that
Winters are milder here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How comes that to pass?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It happens so by reason of
the warm Vapours that arise
from the Sea, whereby the
Rigour of the Season is allay'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The truth is, England is
a very temperate Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is so very temperate,
that whilst the Winter mortifies
the vegetable and sensitive
Creatures in the Northern Regions, 
here we see frequently the Fields
cloathed with green Grass, as in
the Spring.
   You cannot but remember so
many fine Days we have had in
the Winter, amidst the gloomy
Days, the Fogs, and Rain of
that Season.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess, 'tis an happy
Result of the Uncertainty of
English Weather.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet there happens too
sometimes Extremities both of
Heat and Cold.
   But they are look'd upon here as
Irregularities.
<pagebreak id="94" />   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, tell me, whether or
no the Winter was very severe
here two Years ago?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was so very sharp and
bitter, that the Thames, 
notwithstanding the Tide coming in and
going out, was for a long time
buried under its Flakes of Ice.
So that both Carts and Coaches
went over it.
   Nay, there was kept for some
time a Fair, where one could
hardly go through for the Crowd.
   And, which is more wonderful,
a little before the Thaw, there
was a whole Ox rosted towards
<font>White-hall</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fancy, the Cold went then
(if ever) through the thin
Walls of London Houses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speak of a Winter that
was a Prodigy all over Europe, 
both as to the Sharpness and
Length thereof.
   But you may assure your self,
that the English came off as well
at least as any Nation.
   He that is rich is warm
enough, you know.
<pagebreak id="95" />
</dialogue> <head> <font>A DIALOGUE</font> , 

OF THE BUILDINGS, AND FEWEL OF
ENGLAND.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Admire at their Buildings
in England. 
   Here they raise Houses three 
Stories high, and two Rooms of a
Floor, besides the Cellarage,
upon Walls of the thickness only of
a Brick and a half.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's enough for Houses
which are to stand but forty or 
fifty years at the most; and for
a Country which does not require
thick Walls, to keep off either Heat
or Cold.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay. But, in case of an
excessive Heat or Cold, how can
those Walls withstand it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess, that when
those Extremities are of long
continuance, and either the Cold or
the Heat has pierced the Walls, it
proves very troublesom and
uneasy.
   But we talk here of an
extraordinary Case. 
   You know, that in every
Country they build according to the
Temperature of the Air of that
Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I grant it.
<pagebreak id="96" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my part, I admire
the Genius of the English in their
modern Buildings.
   And it is really a Thing worthy
your Admiration at London, to
see Houses built upon a little spot
of Ground, so neat, and so
convenient.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Truth is, they found
out here the right way of
Building.
   But nothing humours me so
much as the Convenience of
Closets, which they have in their
Rooms.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> However I cannot be
reconciled with their common Fewel,
the Sea-coals.
   So noisom it is by the gross
Vapours it casts forth, which stick
not only to Houshold-goods and
Clothes, but to the very Hands
and Face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Great are the
Conveniencies of this very Fewel which
you blame.
   First, it makes a Fire much
hotter than Wood do's.
   Secondly, a Sea-coal Fire is
much more lasting, because those
Coals are a great deal more
compact than Wood is.
   Thirdly, there is moreover this
Advantage in Sea-coals,
especially in a great City, that it is to be
had at a cheap rate.
   Insomuch that for a small
matter one may keep at London a
constant Fire. And I make not
<pagebreak id="97" />
the least doubt, but that when it
is nipping cold, the common sort
of People at <font>Paris</font> would be glad,
could they compass it, to change
Fewel with the Londoners.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not there, besides those
Sea-coals, another sort of Coals,
which is used amongst the
Nobility and Gentry of the Land?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You mean Scotch-Coals,
which is altogether massive, and
makes as clear a Fire as Wood it
self.
   You cannot but know, that they
burn here likewise a good deal
of Wood.
   Nay, there are some Countries
in England, where they scarce
burn any Thing else.

</dialogue> <head> <font>A DIALOGUE</font> ,

OF THE ENGLISH FOOD.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have hinted to me
before, that England was
a plentiful Country of Corn and
Grass.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess there is good Bread,
and good Meat, and both of them
even at London, at very
reasonable Rates.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the Wonder of it,
that Provisions should be
commonly so cheap in so vast, so
populous, and so rich a place as this 
City is.
<pagebreak id="98" />
   I leave you to think how cheap
they live in the Country, but
especially in Places remote from this 
Gulf.
   But, to insist upon Particulars,
where is there better Beef to be
had, than is in England?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is admirable indeed.
   Tis the Partridge of England.
   And I could wish that
Mutton were as good in its kind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must know, Friend, 
how to distinguish in this case.
   The great Mutton is commonly
course, and is not for a sweet
Tooth.
   But the small Mutton (or
rather the middle size) such as
feeds in dry Pastures, is very
palatable.
   Veal and Lamb are likewise
very good.
   And, as for Venison, England
has an infinite Number of Parks
and Warrens; those peopled with
Deer, these swarming with
Rabbets.
   There is also abundance of
Fowls, which are not generally so
delicious to the Taste, as those in
France.
   But some sort there is very 
good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are not Fruits waterish
here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Season proves
rainy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Fish do they eat here?
<pagebreak id="99" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here they have all sorts of
Fish that the Sea, Ponds, and
Rivers can afford.
   But perhaps you will say 'tis 
waterish.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a Wag.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for Drink, shew me a 
Country in Europe, that has more 
Variety.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You make me mad, when
you talk of English Drink.
   'Tis nothing but boiled Water.
   Tell me of Wine, that
admirable Liquor which cheers up the
Heart of Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see I must first shake off
from your Mind those Prejudices
you have against Beer.
   And so you will so much the
more easily be weaned from that
conceited opinion you have of
Wine.
   In order to which, you must
know, that in England they make
all sorts of Beer, both small and
strong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is there any that hath the
quick taste and strength of Wine?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, let me go on.
   The small Beer is commonly
drunk at Meals, because it is
cooling, and apt to quench ones 
Thirst.
   Nay, it is very proper Drink for
French People.
   'Tis good sometimes to mix
Water with Wine.
<pagebreak id="100" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understand ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The strong is either Beer, or
Ale.
   Beer is made with Hops. It
has a strong and pungent Taste,
and will keep several Years.
   Whereas Ale, being made
without Hops, is sweet, and do's not
keep. Therefore 'tis usually
mingled with the other.
   And that is the common sort of
Drink in England.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would fain know,
whether this Drink can be so strong
as to make one drunk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may see Instances of
it daily amongst the common sort
of People.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What? Wou'd you make me
believe that they make themselves
drunk with Beer?
   It must be with Wine, or
Brandy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis an easy thing to
convince ye of what I say to you.
   But let us lay aside those
common sorts of Drink, and let me
tell you that in England they make
Beer even stronger than Wine.
   There is in your Country a
Person of good quality, who knows
it by Experience.
   Nay, there is Beer to be had,
which burns like Brandy, and
flies up as quick into the Head.
<pagebreak id="101" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You tell me here many
Things that I was ignorant of.
   Meanwhile you put me in mind
of an Account I had not long since
in France.
   That here is a sort of bottled
Beer, which makes sometimes a
sportfult Splutter.
   I was told, that it blows up
now and then the Cork into the
Air with a great noise, and then
gets out of its Prison with so much
Impetuousness, that the
Spectatours are at the same time
amazed at, and diverted with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, sometimes it do's
more than so.
   For, when it is in the height
of Fermentation, if it wants Air,
'twill break the Bottle, and make
way through the same.
   And you know what strong
Bottles they have in this Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then sure the Beer must
needs be very strong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ordinary Ale will do that
in Summer-time, when it is
bottled, before it has done working.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I conceive, that Beer
and Ale, good or bad, is the
common Drink in England.
   Pray, tell me, what other
Liquours they have here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here they make great
plenty of Cider, but chiefly in the
Country.
<pagebreak id="102" />
   The best comes from 
<font>Herefordshire</font> , which is very much 
esteemed, and bears at London the same
Price as French Wines, to wit,
twelve Pence a Bottle.
   But I forgot to tell you, that
as you have in France a hundred
ways to dress your Victuals, so
we are, near upon the matter, as
full of Variety in our Drinks.
   It were a hard matter for me
to name you but half on't.
   Only I shall tell you, that, as
they have not the same degree of
Strength, so they differ likewise
in their Taste, according to the
several Ingredients they consist of.
   Nay, there is some made
Physical, and good for several
Diseases.
   But, besides Beer and Cider,
you must know this Country affords
a great deal of Mead; and that
in private Families they make
Currans and Gooseberry-wine, two
sorts of Fruit this Country is
very plentiful of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for Wines, 'tis true the
Sun is not hot enough in England,
to supply it with that sort of
Liquor.
   Not, but that there grow 
sometimes very good Grapes.
   But, this Country being so
conveniently surrounded with the
Sea, here is brought not only an
<pagebreak id="103" />
incredible Quantity of your French
Wines, but also the most
delicious Wines of Italy, Spain, 
Portugal, and Madera Islands.
   More than that, the English go
as far as the Canary Islands, to
make Provision of Canary-Wines,
whereof there is more drunk in
England than in all Europe
besides.
   Wines they have, even from
Greece and Smyrna, for
Varieties-sake.
   And, as for German Wines,
what more common than Rhenish,
or Mosella?
   So you may see, that England
do's not fare the worse for
bearing no Wine of its own.
   On the contrary, 'tis more to
be feared, that an excessive
drinking of that Liquor will do it a
Prejudice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must grant me
however, that Wine is best at the 
Spring. 
   There it is natural, and
cheaper to be sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis true, in France you
drink it at the first hand.
   But, set aside French Wines,
England and France are upon the
same terms.
   Outlandish Wines are as great
Strangers to France as to England.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In France they drink but
little of outlandish Wine.
<pagebreak id="104" />
   They have Wine enough of their
own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say what you will, Men are
pleased with Variety; but here
lies the matter, it is chargeable.
   Whereas the English Nation,
being rich, spare for nothing, when
they mean to enjoy themselves.
   You think it a great
Advantage to drink Wine upon the Place
where it grows. But you must
undeceive your self, as to
strong-bodied Wine.
   For 'tis a certain Truth, that
such Wines drink far better in
England than where they grow.
   The Sea refines 'em, and
makes 'em more palatable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>V.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hear the English Vintners
refines 'em too most ingeniously,
and that they have a great Gift
that way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is doubtless too much
of that true, and it is a grievous
thing.
   However, this Abuse is not so
universal, but that one may have
plenty of good natural Wine.
   I could tell you moreover of an
infinite Number of Cordial Drinks
which are made in England, but
that it is time to put a Period to
this present Discourse.
   Another time we shall speak of
the Use of Brandy, Coffee, Tee,
Chocolate, and Tobacco, which
are so commonly used in England.
