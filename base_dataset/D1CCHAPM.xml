   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis well enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea well enough you say, this recompence
haue I for all my woundes: then thus the King 
inamoured of an other ladie compares your face to hers, and saies
that yours is fat and flat, and that your neather lip was 
passing big.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O wicked man, doth he so sodainlie condemne
my beautie, that when he married me he thought diuine:
for euer blasted be that strumpets face, as all my hopes are
blasted, that did change them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay Madam, though he saide your face was fat,
and flat, and so forth, yet he liked it best, and said, a perfect
beautie should be so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>La.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O did he so! why that was right euen as it should be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You see now Madam, howe much too hastie you
were in your griefes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Que.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he did so esteeme of me indeed, happie am I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So may your highnesse be that hath so good a 
husband, but hell hath no plague to such an one as I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed Madam, you haue a bad husband: truly
then did the king growe mightily in loue with the other 
ladie, and swore, no king could more inriched be, then to 
inioy so faire a dame as shee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O monstrous man, and acurst most miserable dame!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Le.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But saies the king I do inioy as faire, &amp; though I  
loue

leade him, none aliue but I may haue the honour to direct
his feete.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How lead him madam? why hee can go as right

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why thou saidest he wanted his cheerfull light.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of reason still <font>I</font> meant, whose light you knowe
should cheerefully guide a worthie King, for he doth loue
her, and hath forced her into a priuate roome where now
they are.

fond man, thou murtherest me with these exclaimes.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Quee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forth and vnlade the poyson of thy tongue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lem.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Another lord did loue this curious ladie, who 
hearing that the King had forced her, as she was walking with
another Earle, ran straightwaies mad for her, and with a 
friend of his, and two or three blacke ruffians more, brake
desperately vpon the person of the King, swearing to take

Gentles whose wits be rare.
