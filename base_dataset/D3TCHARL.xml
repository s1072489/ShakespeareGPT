<pagebreak id="19" />
<nonSpeech>The Charge being read the Lord President
replyed:</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you have now heard
your Charge read, containing such matter as
appears in it; you finde, That in the close of it,
it is prayed to the Court, in the behalf of the
<font>Commons</font> of <font>England</font> , that you answer to your
Charge. The Court expects your Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would know by what power
I am called hither: I was, not long ago, in the
<font>Isle of Wight</font> , how I came there, is a longer
story then I think is fit at this time for me to
speak of; but there I entred into a <font>Treaty</font>
with both Houses of <font>Parliament</font> with as 
<pagebreak id="20" />
much publique faith as it's possible to be had
of any people in the world. I treated there
with a number of Honorable Lords and
Gentlemen, and treated honestly and uprightly;
I cannot say but they did very nobly with me,
we were upon a conclusion of the <font>Treaty</font> .
Now I would know by what Authority, I
mean, lawful; there are many unlawful
Authorities in the world, Theeves and Robbers
by the high-ways: but I would know by
what Authority I was brought from thence,
and carryed from place to place, (and I know
not what,) and when I know what lawful
Authority, I shall answer: Remember I am
your King, your lawful King, and what sins
you bring upon your heads, and the Judgment
of God upon this Land, think well upon it, I
say, think well upon it, before you go further
from one sin to a greater; therefore let me
know by what lawful Authority I am seated
here, and I shall not be unwilling to answer,
in the mean time I shall not betray my Trust:
I have a Trust committed to me by God, by
old and lawful descent, I will not betray it to
answer to a new unlawful Authority,
therefore resolve me that, and you shall hear more
of me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had been pleased to
have observed what was hinted to you, by
<pagebreak id="21" />
the <font>Court</font> , at your first coming hither, you
would have known by what Authority;
which Authority requires you, in the name of
the People of <font>England</font> , of which you are
Elected King, to answer them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, I deny that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you acknowledg not the
Authority of the <font>Court</font> , they must proceed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do tell them so, <font>England</font> was
never an Elective Kingdom, but an Hereditary
Kingdom for neer these thousand years;
therefore let me know by what Authority I am
called hither: I do stand more for the <font>Liberty</font>
of my People then any here that come to be
my pretended Judges; and therefore let me
know by what <font>lawful Authority</font> I am seated
here, and I will answer it, otherwise I will
not answer it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, how really you have
managed your Trust, is known; your way of
answer is to interrogate the <font>Court</font> , which
beseems not you in this condition. You have been
told of it twice or thrice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a Gentleman, Lievt. Col.
<font>Cobbet</font> , (ask him) if he did not bring me from
the <font>Isle of Wight</font> by force? I do not come here
as submitting to the <font>Court</font> ; I wil stand as much
for the priviledg of the house of Co~mons,
rightly understood, as any man here whatsoever. I
<pagebreak id="22" />
see no House of Lords here that may constitute
a <font>Parliament</font> , and (the King too) should
have been. Is this the bringing of the King to
his <font>Parliament</font> ? Is this the bringing an end to
the <font>Treaty</font> in the publike Faith of the world?
Let me see a legal <font>Authority</font> warranted by the
Word of God, the Scriptures, or warranted
by the <font>Constitutions</font> of the Kingdom, and I
will answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You have propounded
a Question, and have been answered: seeing
you will not answer, the <font>Court</font> will consider
how to proceed; in the mean time, those that
brought you hither, are to take charge of you
back again.
   The <font>Court</font> desires to know whether this be
all the Answer you will give, or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I desire that you would give
me, and all the world, satisfaction in this; let
me tell you, it is not a slight thing you are
about. I am sworn to keep the Peace by that
duty I ow to <font>God</font> and my <font>Country</font> , and I will
do it to the last breath of my body, and
therefore you shall do well to satisfie first <font>God</font> , and
then the <font>Country</font> , by what <font>Authority</font> you do
it, if you do it by a usurped <font>Authority</font> , that
will not last long. There is a God in Heaven
that will call you, and all that give you Power,
to account: Satisfie me in that, and I will
<pagebreak id="23" />
answer, otherwise I betray my Trust, and the
<font>Liberties</font> of the People, and therefore think
of that, and then I shall be willing. For I do
avow, That it is as great a sin to withstand
lawful <font>Authority</font> , as it is to submit to a 
Tyrannical, or any other ways unlawful 
<font>Authority</font> , and therefore satisfie God, and me, and
all the world in that, and you shall receive my
Answer: I am not afraid of the Bill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Court</font> expects you
should give them a final Answer, their
purpose is to adjourn till Monday next, if you do
not satisfie your self, though we do tell you
our <font>Authority</font> ; we are satisfied with our
<font>Authority</font> , and it is upon <font>Gods Authority</font> and the 
<font>Kingdoms</font> , and that Peace you speak of will
be kept in the doing of Justice, and that's our
present Work.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me tell you, if you will
shew me what lawful <font>Authority</font> you have, I
shall be satisfied; But that you have said
satisfies no reasonable man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's in your apprehension:
we think it reasonable that are your Judges.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis not my apprehension, nor
yours neither, that ought to decide it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Presid.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Court</font> hath heard you,
and you are to be disposed of as they have
commanded.
<pagebreak id="24" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Two things were remarkable in this
days Proceedings.</font>
1. It is to be observed, That as the Charge
was reading against the King, the silver
head of his staff fell off, the which he
wondred at, and seeing none to take it
up, he stoops for it himself.
2. That as the King was going away, he 
looked with a very austere countenance
upon the <font>Court</font> , with stirring of his Hat
replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (when the <font>Lord 
President</font> commanded the Guard to take
him away,) and at his going down, he
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I do not fear that</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (pointing with
his Staff at the Sword). The people in 
the Hall, as he went down the stairs,
cryed out, some,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>God save the King</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and some for</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Justice</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>O Yes being called, the <font>Court</font> adjourned till
Monday next, <font>January</font> 22. at 9. in the
morning to the painted Chamber, and from thence
to the same place again in <font>Westminster</font> Hall.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="25" />
 <head> <font>AT THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE SITTING IN
WESTMINSTER HALL, MUNDAY, JANUARY</font> 22. 1648.</head> 

<nonSpeech>O Yes made. Silence commanded. The Court
called, and answered to their names.
   Silence commanded upon pain of 
imprisonment, and the Captain of the Guard <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Gaurd</comment> to
apprehend all such as make disturbance.
   Upon the Kings coming in a shout was 
made.
   Command given by the Court to the
Captain of the Guard to fetch and take into his
custody those who make any disturbance.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr Solicitor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please your Lordship,
my Lord President,
   I did at the last Court in the behalf of the
Commons of England, exhibit and give into
this Court a Charge of high Treason, and other
high Crimes, against the Prisoner at the Bar,
whereof I do accuse him in the name of the
People of England, and the Charge was read
unto him, and his Answer required. My Lord,
He was not then pleased to give an Answer,
but instead of answering, did there dispute the
Authority of this high Court. My humble
Motion to this high Court, in behalf of the
<pagebreak id="26" />
Kingdom of England, is, That the Prisoner may
be directed to make a positive Answer, either
by way of Confession, or Negation; which if
he shall refuse to do, That the matter of Charge
may be taken <font> <foreign>pro confesso</foreign> </font> , and the Court may
proceed according to justice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You may remember
at the last Court you were told the occasion
of your being brought hither, and you heard a
Charge against you, containing a Charge of
high Treason, and other high Crimes, against
this Realm of England; you heard likewise,
that it was prayed in the behalf of the People,
that you should give an Answer to that
Charge, that thereupon such proceedings
might be had as should be agreeable to justice;
you were then pleased to make some scruples
concerning the Authority of this Court, and
knew not by what Authority you were
brought hither; you did divers times
propound your Questions, and were as often
answered, That it was by Authority of the
<font>Commons of England assembled in Parliament</font> ,
that did think fit to call you to account for
those high and capital Misdemeanours
wherewith you were then charged. Since that the
Court hath taken into Consideration what you
then said, they are fully satisfied with their
own authority, and they hold it fit you should
<pagebreak id="27" />
stand satisfied with it too; and they do
require it, that you do give a positive and
particular Answer to this Charge that is exhibited
against you, they do expect you should either
confess or deny it; if you deny, it is offered
in the behalf of the Kingdom to be made good 
against you; their authority they do avow to
the whole world, that the whole Kingdom are
to rest satisfied in, and you are to rest satisfied
with it, and therefore you are to lose no more
time, but to give a positive Answer
thereunto.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The KING.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I was here last, 'tis
very true, I made that Question, and truly if it
were only my own particular case, I would
have satisfied my self with the Protestation I 
made the last time I was here against the 
legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be
tryed by any Superiour Jurisdiction on Earth;
but it is not my case alone, it is the Freedom
and the Liberty of the People of England, and
do you pretend what you will, I stand more
for their Liberties. For if Power without Law
may make Laws, may alter the fundamental
Laws of the Kingdom, I do not know what
Subject he is in England, that can be sure of
his life, or any thing that he calls his own;
therefore when that I came here, I did expect
particular Reasons, to know by what Law,
<pagebreak id="28" />
what Authority you did proceed against me
here, and therefore I am a little to seek what to
say to you in this particular, because the
Affirmative is to be proved, the Negative often is
very hard to do: but since I cannot perswade
you to do it, I shall tell you my Reasons as
short as I can.
   My Reasons why in Conscience, and the
duty I owe to God first, and my People next, for
the preservation of their Lives, Liberties and
Estates; I conceive I cannot answer this, till
I be satisfied of the legality of it.
   All proceedings against any man
whatsoever --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I must interrupt you,
which I would not do, but that what you do
is not agreeable to the proceedings of any
Court of Justice, you are about to enter into
Argument, and dispute concerning the
Authority of this Court, before whom you appear as
a Prisoner, and are charged as an high
Delinquent; if you take upon you to dispute the
Authority of the Court, we may not do it, nor
will any Court give way unto it, you are to
submit unto it, you are to give in a punctual 
and direct Answer, whether you will answer
your Charge or no, and what your Answer is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The KING.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, by your favour, I do not
know the forms of Law, I do know Law and
<pagebreak id="29" />
Reason, though I am no Lawyer profess'd, but
I know as much Law as any Gentleman in
England; and therefore (under favour) I do
plead for the Liberties of the People of England
more then you do, and therefore if I should
impose a belief upon any man without
Reasons given for it, it were unreasonable; but I
must tell you, That that Reason that I have as
thus informed, I cannot yield unto it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I must interrupt you,
you may not be permitted, you speak of Law
and Reason, it is fit there should be Law
and Reason, and there is both against you. Sir,
the Vote of the Commons of England
assembled in Parliament, it is the Reason of the
Kingdom, and they are these that have given
to that Law, according to which you should
have ruled and raigned: Sir, you are not to
dispute our Authority, you are told it again
by the Court. Sir, it will be taken notice of,
that you stand in contempt of the Court, and
your contempt will be recorded accordingly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The KING.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know how a King
can be a Delinquent; but by any Law that
ever I heard of, all men (Delinquents, or what
you will) let me tell you, they may put in
Demurrers against any proceeding as legal, and I
do demand that, and demand to be heard with
my Reasons, if you deny that, you deny
Reason.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you have offered
something to the Court, I shall speak something
unto you the sence of the Court. Sir, neither you
nor any man are permitted to dispute that
point, you are concluded, you may not demur
the Jurisdiction of the Court, if you do, I must
let you know, that they over-rule your
Demurrer, they sit here by the Authority of the
Commons of <font>England</font> , and all your Predecessors,
and you are responsible to them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I deny that, shew me one president.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you ought not to
interrupt while the Court is speaking to you,
this point is not to be debated by you,
neither will the Court permit you to do it, if
you offer it by way of Demurrer to the
Jurisdiction of the Court, they have considered of
their Jurisdiction, they do affirm their own
Jurisdiction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say Sir, by your favour, that
the Commons of England was never a Court
of Judicature, I would know how they came
to be so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You are not to be
permitted to go on in that speech, and these 
discourses.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Clerk of the Court read, as
followeth:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
CHARLS STUART <font>King of England,
<pagebreak id="31" />
You have been accused on the behalf of the
People of England of high Treason, and other
high Crimes; the Court have determined
that you ought to answer the same</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will answer the same so soon
as I know by what Authority you do this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If this be all that you will
say, then, Gentlemen, you that brought the
Prisoner hither, take charge of him back
again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do require that I may give in
my Reasons why I do not answer, and give
me time for that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, 'Tis not for Prisoners
to require.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prisoners? Sir, I am not an
ordinary Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Court hath
considered of their Jurisdiction, and they have already
affirmed their Jurisdiction; if you will not
answer, we shall give order to record your
default.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You never heard my Reasons 
yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Your Reasons are not
to be heard against the highest Jurisdiction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shew me that Jurisdiction
where Reason is not to be heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, We shew it you here,
<pagebreak id="32" />
the Commons of England; and the next time
you are brought, you will know more of the
pleasure of the Court, and, it may be, their final
determination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shew me where ever the House
of Commons was a Court of Judicature of
that kind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Serjeant, Take away the
Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir, Remember that the
King is not suffered to give in his Reasons for
the Liberty and Freedom <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Feeedom</comment> of all his Subjects.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You are not to have
liberty to use this language; how great a
friend you have been to the Laws and
Liberties of the People, let all England and the
world judg.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, under favour, it was the
Liberty, Freedom, and Laws of the Subject that
ever I took -- defended my self
with Arms, I never took up Arms against the
People, but for the Laws.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Command of the
Court must be obeyed; no answer will be
given to the Charge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lord President ordered the
default to be recorded, and the contempt of the
Court, and that no answer would be given to
the Charge.
<pagebreak id="33" />
   And so was guarded forth to Sir <font>Robert
Cottons</font> house.
   Then the Court adjourned to the Painted
Chamber on Tuesday at twelve a clock, and
from thence they intend to adjourn to 
Westminster Hall, at which time all persons
concerned are to give their attendance.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <font>AT THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE SITTING IN
WESTMINSTER HALL, TUESDAY, IANUARY</font> 23. 1648.</head> 

<nonSpeech>O Yes made. Silence commanded. The 
Court called. Seventy three persons 
present.
   The King comes in with his Guard, looks
with an austere countenance upon the Court,
and sits down.
   The second O Yes made, and silence 
commanded.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr</font> Cook <font>Solicitor General</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please
your Lordship, my Lord President,
   This is now the third time, that by the great
grace and favour of this high Court, the
prisoner hath been brought to the Bar before any
issue joyned in the cause. My Lord, I did at
the first Court exhibite a Charge against him,
containing the highest Treason that ever
<pagebreak id="34" />
was wrought upon the <font>Theatre</font> of <font>England</font> :
That a King of England, trusted to keep the
Law, That had taken an Oath so to do, That
had Tribute paid him for that end, should be
guilty of a wicked design, subvert and
destroy our Laws, and introduce an <font>Arbitrary,
and Tyrannical Government</font> , in the defence
of the <font>Parliament and their Authority</font> , set up
his <font>Standard</font> for War against his <font>Parliament</font>
and <font>People</font> ; and I did humbly pray, in the
behalf of the <font>People of England</font> , that he might
speedily be required to make an Answer to the
Charge.
   But, my Lord, instead of making any answer,
he did then dispute the Authority of this High
Court; Your Lordship was pleased to give
him a further day to consider and to put in his
Answer, which day being yesterday, I did
humbly move, that he might be required to
give a direct and positive Answer, either by
denying, or confession of it; but (my
Lord) he was then pleased for to demur to
the Jurisdiction of the Court, which the Court
did then over-rule, and command him to give
a direct and positive Answer. My Lord, 
Besides this great delay of Justice, I shall now
humbly move your Lordship for speedy
Judgment against him. My Lord, I might press
your Lordship upon the whole, That
<pagebreak id="35" />
according to the known Rules of the Law of the
Land, That if a Prisoner shall stand as
contumacious in contempt, and shall not put in an
issuable Plea, guilty or not guilty of the Charge
given against him, whereby he may come to a
fair Tryal; That as by an implicite Confession,
it may be taken <font> <foreign>pro confesso</foreign> </font> , as it hath been
done to those, who have deserved more favor
then the Prisoner at the Bar has done: But
besides, my Lord, I shall humbly press your
Lordship upon the whole Fact; The House of
Commons, the supream Authority and
Jurisdiction of the Kingdom, they have Declared,
That it is notorious, That the matter of the
Charge is true, as it is in truth (my Lord) as
clear as chrystal, and as the Sun that shines at
noon day, which if your Lordship and the
Court be not satisfied in, I have
notwithstanding, on the People of Englands behalf,
several witnesses to produce: And therefore I do
humbly pray, and yet I must confess it is not
so much I, as the innocent blood that hath been
shed, the Cry whereof is very great for Justice 
and Judgment; and therefore I do humbly
pray, That speedy JUDGMENT
be pronounced against the Prisoner at the
Bar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You have heard
what is moved by the Councel on the
<pagebreak id="36" />
behalf of the Kingdom against you. Sir, you 
may well remember, and if you do not, the 
Court cannot forget what delatory dealings
the Court hath found at your hands, you were
pleased to propound some Questions, you
have had your Resolution upon them. You
were told over and over again, That the Court
did affirm their own Jurisdiction, That it was
not for you, nor any other man, to dispute
the <font>Jurisdiction of the Supream and highest
Authority of England</font> , from which there is
no Appeal, and touching which there must be
no dispute; yet you did persist in such
carriage, as you gave no manner of obedience,
nor did you acknowledge any Authority in
them, nor the <font>high Court, that constituted this
Court of Justice</font>
   Sir, I must let you know from the Court,
That they are very sensible of these delays of
yours, and that they ought not, being thus
Authorized by the <font>supream Court of England</font> ,
to be thus trifled withal, and that they might
in Justice, if they pleased, and according to the
Rules of Justice, take advantage of these
delays, and proceed to pronounce judgment
against you; yet nevertheless they are pleased
to give direction, and on their behalfs I do
require you, That you make a positive Answer
unto this Charge that is against you Sir, in plain
<pagebreak id="37" />
terms, for Justice knows no respect of
persons; you are to give your positive and finall
Answer in plain English, whether you be guilty
or not guilty of these Treasons laid to your
Charge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The KING after a little pause, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   When I was here yesterday, I did desire to
speak for the <font>Liberties of the People of
England</font> ; I was interrupted: I desire to know yet
whether I may speak freely or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You have had the
Resolution of the Court upon the like
Question the last day, and you were told, That
having such a Charge of so high a Nature against
you, and your Work was, that you ought to
acknowledge the JURISDICTION
<font>of the </font> COURT, <font>and to Answer to your</font>
CHARGE. Sir, if you Answer to your
Charge, which the Court gives you leave now
to do, though they might have taken the
advantage of your contempt, yet if you be able
to Answer to your Charge, when you have
once Answered, you shall be heard at large,
make the best Defence you can. But Sir, I
must let you know from the Court, as their
commands, that you are not to be permitted to
issue out into any other discourses, till such time
as you have given a positive Answer
<pagebreak id="38" />
concerning the <font>Matter</font> that is <font>CHARG'D</font> upon
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the <font>Charge</font> , I value it not
a Rush, it is the <font>Liberty</font> of the People of
England that I stand for; for me to acknowledge a
new <font>Court</font> that I never heard of before, I that
am your King, that should be an example to all
the people of England for to uphold Justice, to
maintain the old Laws; indeed I do not know
how to do it; you spoke very well the first day
that I came here, (on Saturday) of the
Obligations that I had laid upon me by God, to the
maintenance of <font>the Liberties of my People</font> :
The same Obligation you spake of, I do
acknowledge to God that I owe to him, and to
my People, to defend as much as in me lies, the
ancient Laws of the Kingdom, therefore untill
that I may know that this is not against the
<font>Fundamental Laws</font> of the Kingdom, by your
favour I can put in no particular <font>Charge</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>This is as the      
King express'd, but I supposed he meant Ans.</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> If
you will give me time, I will
shew you my reasons why
I cannot do it, and this --
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Here being interrupted, he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   By your favour, you ought not to interrupt
me; how I came here I know not, there's no
Law for it to make your King your Prisoner:
I was in a Treaty upon the publique Faith of
<pagebreak id="39" />
the Kingdom, that was the known --
two Houses of Parliament that was the
Representative of the Kingdom, and when that I
had almost made an end of the Treaty, then
I was hurried away and brought hither, and
therefore --
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Here the Lord <font>President</font> said;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you must
know the pleasure of the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By your favour Sir:
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay Sir, by your favour,
you may not be permitted to fall into those
discourses; you appear as a Delinquent, you have
not acknowledged the authority of the Court,
the Court craves it not of you, but once more
they command you to give your positive
Answer -- <font>Clark.</font> Do your 
Duty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Duty Sir!
</dialogue><nonSpeech>The Clark reads.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>CHARLES STUART, KING 
of</font> England, <font>You are accused in the behalf of
the Commons of</font> England <font>of divers high crimes
and Treasons, which Charge hath been read
unto You; the Court now requires you to give
Your positive and final Answer by way of
confession, or denial of the Charge</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I say again to you, so that
I might give satisfaction to the People of
<font>England</font> of the clearness of my proceeding, not by
<pagebreak id="40" />
way of Answer, not in this way, but to satisfie
them that I have done nothing against that
Trust that hath been committed to me, I
would do it; but to acknowledge a new
Court against their Priviledges, to alter the
fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, Sir you must
excuse me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, this is the the third
time that you have publiquely disown'd this
Court, and put an affront upon it; how far you
have preserv'd Priviledges of the People, your
actions have spoke it; but truly Sir, mens
intentions ought to be known by their actions,
you have written your meaning in bloudy
Characters throughout the whole Kingdom;
but Sir you understand the pleasure of the
<font>Court</font> , -- <font>Clerk</font> Record 
the default, -- and 
Gentlemen, you that took charge of the Prisoner,
take him back again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will only say this one word
more to you, if it were only my own
particular, I would not say any more, nor interrupt
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you have heard the
pleasure of the <font>Court</font> , and you are 
(notwithstanding you will not understand it) to find
that you are before a COURT of 
JUSTICE.
<pagebreak id="41" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the King went forth with his Guard,
and Proclamation was made, That all persons
which had then appear'd, and had further to do
at the <font>Court</font> might depart into the 
<font>Painted-Chamber</font> , to which place the <font>Court</font> did
forthwith adjourn, and intended to meet in

 <head> <font>THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE
SITTING IN</font> WESTMINSTER HALL, <font>ON SATURDAY
THE</font> 27. <font>OF</font> JANUARY, 1648.</head> 

<nonSpeech>O Yes made. Silence commanded. The <font>Court</font>
called. Serjeant <font>Bradshaw</font> , <font>Lord
President</font> (in a Scarlet robe) with sixty eight other
Members of the Court.

   As the King comes in, a cry made in the Hall
for</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Execution, Iustice, Execution</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall desire a word to be heard a
little, and I hope I shall give no occasion of
interruption.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may answer in your
time, hear the <font>Court</font> first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it please you Sir, I desire to be
heard, and I shall not give any occasion of
interruption, and it is only in a word, a sudden
Judgment. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir you shall be heard in
due time, but you are to hear the <font>Court</font> 
first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I desire it will be in order to
what I believe the <font>Court</font> will say; and 
<pagebreak id="43" />
therefore Sir, an hasty Judgment is not so soon
recall'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, You shall be heard 
before the Judgment be given, and in the mean
time you may forbear. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir, shall I be heard before the
Judgment be given?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, it is well
known to all, or most of you here present, That
the Prisoner at the Bar hath been severall times
convented and brought before the <font>Court</font> to
make Answer to a <font>Charge</font> of Treason, and
other high crimes exhibited against him
in the name of the People of </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Here a Malignant Lady interrupted  
the Court, (saying</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>not halfe the people) </font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>but she was  
soon silenced</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
<font>England</font> , to which <font>Charge</font> being
required to Answer, he hath been so
far from obeying the commands of
the <font>Court</font> by submitting to their
Justice, as he began to take upon
him to offer reasoning and debate
unto the Authority of the <font>Court</font> ,
and of the highest <font>Court</font> that
constituted them to Try and judge him;
but being over-ruled in that, and
required to make his Answer, he
was still pleased to continue
contumacious, and to refuse to submit or Answer:
Hereupon the <font>Court</font> , that they may not be
<pagebreak id="44" />
wanting to themselves, to the trust reposed in
them, nor that any mans wilfulness
prevent Justice, they have thought fit to take the
matter into their consideration; They have
considered of the contumacy, and of that
confession, which in Law doth arise upon that
contumacy; They have likewise considered of
the notoriety of the Fact charg'd upon this
Prisoner, and upon the whole matter they are
resolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be
now pronounced against this Prisoner: but in
respect he doth desire to be heard, before the
Sentence be read, and pronounc'd, the <font>Court</font>
hath resolved that they will hear him; yet Sir,
thus much I must tell you before-hand, which
you have been minded of at other <font>Courts</font> , That
if that you have to say be to offer any debate
concerning Jurisdiction, you are not to be
heard in it, you have offered it formerly, and
you have indeed struck at the root, that is the
power and <font>Supreme Authority of the
Commons of England</font> , which this <font>Court</font> will not
admit a debate of, and which indeed is an
irrational thing in them to do, being a <font>Court</font> that
acts upon <font>Authority</font> derived from them, that
they should presume to judge upon their
Superior, from whom there's no Appeal. But Sir, if
you have any thing to say in defence of your self
concerning the matter charged, the <font>Court</font> hath
<pagebreak id="45" />
given me in command to let you know they
will hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since that I see that you will 
not hear any thing of debate concerning that
which I confess I thought most material for
the peace of the Kingdom, and for the Liberty
of the Subject, I shall wave it, I shall speak
nothing to it, but only I must tell you, That
this many a day all things have been taken
away from me, but that that I call more dearer
to me then my life, which is, <font>My Conscience
and my Honor</font> ; and if I had respect to my Life
more then the Peace of the Kingdom, the
<font>Liberty of the Subject</font> , certainly I should have
made a particular defence for my self, for by
that at leastwise I might have delayed an ugly
Sentence, which I believe will pass upon me;
Therefore certainly Sir, as a man that hath
some understanding, some knowledge of the
world, if that my true zeal to my <font>Country</font> had
not over-born the care that I have of
my own preservation, I should have gone
another way to work then that I have done; Now
Sir I conceive, That an hasty <font>Sentence</font> once
past may sooner be repented then recalled, and
truly, the self-same desire that I have for <font>the
Peace of the Kingdom, and the Liberty of the
Subject</font> , more <font>then my own particular</font> , does
make me now at last desire, That having
<pagebreak id="46" />
something for to say that concerns both, I desire
before <font>Sentence</font> be given, that I may be heard in
the <font>Painted-Chamber</font> before the Lords and
Commons, this delay cannot be prejudicial to
you whatsoever I say, if that I say no reason,
those that hear me must be Judges, I cannot be
Judge of that that I have, if it be reason, and
really for <font>the welfare of the Kingdom, and the
Liberty of the Subject</font> , I am sure on't very
well tis worth the hearing; Therefore I do
conjure you, as you love that that you pretend,
I hope it's real, <font>the Liberty of the Subject, the
Peace of the Kingdom</font> , that you will grant me
the hearing before any <font>Sentence</font> be past, I only
desire this, that you will take this into your
consideration, it may be you have not heard of 
it before hand, if you will I'le retire, and you
may think of it, but if I cannot get this 
<font>Liberty</font> , I do here protest that so fair shews of
<font>Liberty and Peace</font> are pure shews, and not
otherwise, then that you will not hear your
<font>KING</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you have now
spoken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And this that you have
said is a further declining of <font>the Iurisdiction of
this Court</font> , which was the thing wherein you
were limited before
<pagebreak id="47" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray excuse me Sir, for my
interruption, because you mistake me, It is not a
declining of it, you do judge me before you hear
me speak, I say it will not, I do not decline it,
though I cannot acknowledge the Jurisdiction
<font>of the Court</font> ; Yet Sir, in this give me leave to
say, I would do it, though I did not 
acknowledge it in this, I do protest it is not the
declining of it, since I say, if that I do say any
thing but that that is for the Peace of <font>the
Kingdom</font> , and <font>the Liberty of the Subject</font> , then
the shame is mine. Now I desire, that you will
take this into your consideration, if you will I'le
withdraw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, This is not altogether
new that you have moved unto us, not
altogether new to us, though the first time in Person
you have offered it to the Court: Sir, you say
you do not Decline the Jurisdiction of the
<font>Court</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in this that I have said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understand you well
Sir, but nevertheless that which you have
offered, seems to be contrary to that saying of 
yours; for the <font>Court</font> are ready to give a
<font>Sentence</font> : it is not as you say, <font>That they will not
hear your King</font> , for they have been ready to
hear you, they have patiently waited <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: wa ted</comment> your
pleasure for three <font>Courts</font> together, to hear what
<pagebreak id="48" />
you would say to the Peoples Charge against
you, to which you have not vouchsafed to give
any Answer at all; Sir, This tends to a further
delay: Truly Sir, such delaies as these neither
may the Kingdom, nor Justice well bear; You
have had three several daies to have offered in
this kind what you would have pleased; This
<font>Court</font> is founded upon that <font>Authority of the
Commons of England, in whom rests the
Supreme Jurisdiction</font> ; That which you now
tender is to have another Jurisdiction, and a
<font>Coordinate Jurisdiction</font> , I know very well you
express your self. Sir, That notwithstanding
that you would offer to the Lords and
Commons in the <font>Painted Chamber</font> , yet
nevertheless you would proceed on here, I did hear
you say so; but Sir, That you would offer there,
what ever it is, it must needs be in delay of the
Justice here, so as if this <font>Court</font> be resolved, and
prepared for the <font>Sentence</font> , this that you offer
they are not bound in Justice to grant; but Sir,
according to that you seem to desire, and
because you shall know the further pleasure of
the <font>Court</font> upon that which you have moved,
the <font>Court</font> will withdraw for a time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall I withdraw?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Yow shall know the
pleasure of the <font>Court</font> presently, </dialogue><nonSpeech>the <font>Court</font> 
withdraws for half an hour into the <font>Court of
Wards</font>
<pagebreak id="49" />
   Sergeant at Arms, the <font>Court</font> gives command
that the Prisoner be withdrawn, and they give
order for his return again.
The Court withdraws for half an hour and 
returns.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sergeant at Arms, send for
your prisoner.
   Sir, you were pleased to make a motion here
to the <font>Court</font> to offer a desire of yours touching
the propounding of somewhat to the Lords
in the Painted Chamber for the Peace of the
Kingdom; Sir, you did in effect receive an
Answer before the Court adjourned; Truly Sir,
their withdrawing and adjournment was <font> <foreign>pro 
forma tantum</foreign> </font> , for it did not seem to them that
there was any difficulty in the thing; they have 
considered of what you have moved, and have
considered of their own <font>Authority</font> , which is
founded, as hath been often said, upon the
<font>Supream Authority of the Commons of England
Assembled in Parliament</font> . This <font>Court</font> acts
accordingly to their Commission. Sir, the return
I have to you from the <font>Court</font> , is this; That
they have been too much delayed by you
already, and this that you now offer hath
occasioned some little further delay, and
they are JUDGES appointed by the
highest JUDGES, and Judges are
<pagebreak id="50" />
no more to delay then they are to deny Justice,
they are good words in the old <font>Charter of
England</font> , <font> <foreign>Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus,
nulli deferremus Justitiam</foreign> </font> : There must be
no delay, but the truth is Sir, and so every
man here observes it, That you have much
delayed them in your contempt and default, for
which they might long since have proceeded to
judgment against you, and notwithstanding
what you have offered, they are resolved to
proceed to punishment, and to Judgment, 
and that is their unanimous resolution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I know it is in vain for me to
dispute, I am no <font>Sceptick</font> for to deny the
Power that you have, I know that you have 
Power enough; Sir, I confess, I think it would
have been for the Kingdoms Peace, if you
would have taken the pains for to have shewn
the Lawfulness of your Power, for this delay
that I have desired, I confess it is a delay, but it
is a delay very important for the Peace of the
Kingdom, for it is not my Person that I look
on alone, it is the Kingdoms well-fare, and the
Kingdoms Peace, it is an old Sentence, <font>That
we should think on long before we have
resolved of great matters suddenly</font> ; Therefore Sir,
I do say again, That I do put at your doors all
the inconveniency of an hasty <font>Sentence</font> , I
confess, I have been here now I think this week,
<pagebreak id="51" />
this day eight days was the day I came here
first, but a little delay of a day or two further
may give Peace, whereas an <font>hasty Judgement</font>
may bring on that trouble and perpetual 
inconveniency to the Kingdom, That the child that
is unborn may repent it; and therefore again, 
out of the Duty I ow to God, and to my
Country, I do desire that I may be heard by the
Lords and Commons in the <font>Painted Chamber</font> ,
or any other Chamber that you will appoint 
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you have bin already answer'd
to what you even now moved, being the same
you moved before, since the Resolution and
the Judgement of the <font>Court</font> in it, and the
<font>Court</font> now requires to know whether you
have any more to say for your self, then you
have said, before they proceed to Sentence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say this Sir, That if you will hear me,
if you will give me but this delay, I doubt not
but I shall give some satisfaction to you all
here, and to my People after that, and
therefore I do require you, as you will answer it at
the dreadfull day of Judgment, that you will
consider it once again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I have received
direction from the <font>Court</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If this must be re-enforc'd, or
<pagebreak id="52" />
any thing of this nature, your answer must be
the same, and they will proceed to <font>Sentence</font> if
you have nothing more to say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I have nothing more to say, but
I shall desire that this may be entered what I
have said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord President.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Court</font> then, Sir, hath
something else to say unto you, which although
I know it will be very unacceptable, yet 
notwithstanding they are willing, and are resolv'd
to discharge their Duty,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would desire onely one word

that --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I must put you in minde.
Truly Sir I would not willingly, at this time
especially, interrupt you in any thing you have
to say that is proper for us to admit of, but
Sir, you have not owned us as a Court, and
you look upon us as a sort of people met
together, and we know what language we receive

and therefore for you to address your self to
us, not to acknowledg us as a <font>Court</font> to judg of
what you say, it is not to be permitted; and
the <font>truth</font> is, all along from the first time, you
were pleased to dis-avow and dis-own us, the
<font>Court</font> needed not to have heard you one
word; For unless they be acknowledged a
<font>Court</font> , and engaged, it is not proper for you
to speak: Sir, we have given you too much
<font>liberty</font> already, and admitted of too much
delay, and we may not admit of any farther;
<pagebreak id="71" />
were it proper for us to do, we should hear
you freely, and we should not have declined
to have heard you at large, what you could
have said or proved on your behalf, whether
for totally excusing, or for in part excusing
those great and hainous charges that in whole
or in part are layd upon you. But Sir, I shall
trouble you no longer, your sins are of so large
a dimension, that if you do but seriously think
of them, they will drive you to a sad
<font>consideration</font> of it, and they may improve in you a
sad and serious <font>repentance</font> . And that the
<font>Court</font> doth heartily wish that you may be so

God may have mercy at least-wise upon your
