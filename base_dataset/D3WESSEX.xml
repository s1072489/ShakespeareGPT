 <head>THE INFORMATION OF <font>MATTHEW HOPKINS</font> , OF <font>MANNINTREE</font> ,
GENT. <font>TAKEN UPON OATH BEFORE US THE 25=TH= DAY OF</font> MARCH. 1645.</head>  

   <nonSpeech>This Informant saith, That the said <font>Elizabeth Clarke</font>        
(suspected
for a Witch as aforesaid) being by the appointment of the
said Justices watched certaine nights, for the better discovery of
her wicked Practises, this Informant came into the roome where
the said <font>Elizabeth</font> was watched, as aforesaid, the last night,    
being
the 24=th= of this instant <font>March</font> ; but intended not to have stayed
long there. But the said <font>Elizabeth</font> forth with told this Informant
and one Master <font>Sterne</font> there present, if they would stay and do the
said <font>Elizabeth</font> no hurt, shee would call one of her white Impes,
and play with it in her lap; but this Informant told her, they
would not allow of it; And that staying there a while longer, the
said <font>Elizabeth</font> confessed shee had had carnall copulation with the
Devill six or seven yeares; and that he would appeare to her three
or foure times in a weeke at her bed side, and goe to bed to her, and
lye with her halfe a night together in the shape of a proper
Gentleman, with a laced band, having the whole proportion of a man,
and would say to her,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Besse I must lye with you</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>and shee   
did never
deny him: And within a quarter of an houre after there appeared
an Impe like to a Dog, which was white, with some sandy spots,
and seemed to be very fat and plumpe; with very short legges, who
forthwith vanished away: And the said <font>Elizabeth</font> said the name of
that Impe was, <font>Jarmara</font> : And immediately there appeared
another Impe, which shee called <font>Vinegar Tom</font> , in the shape of a 
Greyhound with long legges: And the said <font>Elizabeth</font> then said     
that the
next Impe should be a black Impe, and should come for the said
Master <font>Sterne</font> , which appeared, but presently vanished: And the
last that appeared was in the shape of a Polcat, but the head
somewhat bigger. And the said <font>Elizabeth</font> then told this Informant 
that
shee had five Impes of her owne, and two of the Impes of the old
Beldam <font>Weste</font> (meaning one <font>Anne Weste</font> , widow) who is now
also suspected to be guilty of Witchcraft: And said sometimes the
Impes of the old Beldam sucked on the said <font>Elizabeth</font> , and
sometimes her Impes sucked on the old Beldam <font>Weste</font> . And the said
<font>Elizabeth</font> further told this Informant, that Satan would never let
<pagebreak id="3" />
her rest, or be quiet, untill shee did consent to the killing of the
Hogges of one M=r= <font>Edwards</font> of <font>Mannintree</font> aforesaid, and the  
Horse
of one <font>Robert Tayler</font> of the same Towne: And this Informant
further saith, That going from the House of the said M=r=            
<font>Edwards</font> to
his own House about nine or ten of the Clock that night, with
his Greyhound with him, he saw the Greyhound suddenly give a 
jumpe, and ran as shee had been in a full course after a Hare;
And that when this Informant made haste to see what his
Greyhound so eagerly pursued; He espied a white thing about the
bignesse of a Kitlyn, and the Greyhound standing aloofe from it;
and that by and by the said white Impe or Kitlyn daunced about
the said Greyhound, and by all likelihood bit off a piece of the
flesh of the shoulder of the Greyhound; for the Greyhound came
shrieking and crying to this Informant with a piece of flesh torne
from her shoulder. And this Informant further saith, That
comming into his own Yard that night, he espied a black thing, 
proportioned like a Cat, onely it was thrice as big, sitting on a
strawberry-bed, and fixing the eyes on this Informant; and when he
went towards it, it leaped over the pale towards this Informant,
as he thought, but ran quite through the Yard, with his
Greyhound after it to a great Gate, which was underset with a paire
of Tumbrell Strings, and did throw the said Gate wide open, and
then vanished; And the said Greyhound returned againe to this
Informant, shaking and trembling exceedingly.</nonSpeech>

 <head>THE INFORMATION OF <font>JOHN STERNE</font> , GENT. TAKEN
<font>UPON OATH BEFORE US THE 25=TH= DAY OF MARCH</font> . 1645.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Informant saith, That watching with <font>Elizabeth Clarke</font> ,
(suspected for Witchcraft, as aforesaid) shee confessed that
the Devill had had carnall copulation with her in the likenesse of
a man; and that the said <font>Elizabeth</font> desired this Informant, and the
rest that were in the roome with her to sit downe, and said, shee
would shew this Informant and the rest some of her Impes: And
within halfe an houre there appeared a white thing in the likeness
of a Cat, but not altogether so big: And being asked if she would
not be afraid of her Impes; the said <font>Elizabeth</font> answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What
<pagebreak id="4" />
doe yee thinke I am afraid of my children</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>And that shee called 
the
name of that white Impe, <font>Hoult</font> . And this Informant further saith,
That presently after there appeared another white Impe, with red
spots, as big as a small dog, which shee then called <font>Jarmara</font> : And
that immediately after, there appeared at the threshold of the
doore another Impe about the bignesse of the first, but did
presently vanish away. And then the said <font>Elizabeth</font> being asked   
if any
more Impes would come; shee answered, <font>That Vinegar Tom would 
come by and by</font> . And forthwith there appeared another in the
likenesse of a dumb Dogge, somewhat bigger then any of the former:
And the said <font>Elizabeth</font> also told this Informant, That shee had
three Impes from her mother, which were of a browne colour,
and two from the old Beldam <font>Weste</font> : And that there had five
Impes appeared; But shee had one more called <font>Sack and Sugar</font> ,
which had been hard at worke, and it would be long before it
came, but it should teare this Informant. And a while after the
said <font>Elizabeth</font> said, That it was well for this Informant he was so
quick, otherwise the said Impe had soone skipped upon his face,
and perchance had got into his throate, and then there would
have been a feast of Toades in this Informants belly. And the said
<font>Elizabeth</font> further confessed to this Informant, that shee had one
Impe for which shee would fight up to the knees in bloud, before
shee would lose it. And that her Impes did commonly suck on the
old Beldam <font>Weste</font> ; and that the said old Beldams Impes, did suck
on her the said <font>Elizabeth</font> likewise.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

</dialogue> <head>THE INFORMATION OF <font>JOHN EDES</font> , CLERKE, TAKEN UPON
<font>OATH BEFORE THE SAID JUSTICES THE 28=TH= DAY OF APRILL</font> . 1645.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Informant saith, That <font>Rebecca Weste</font> confessed unto him,
that about seven yeares since, shee began to have familiaritie
with the Devill, by the instigation of her mother <font>Anne Weste</font> ;
who hath appeared unto the said <font>Rebecca</font> at severall times, in
diverse shapes: At one time in the likenesse of a proper young man,
who desired of her, that he might have the same familiaritie with
her, that others that appeared unto her before had had: 
Promising that if shee would, he would then doe for the said         
<font>Rebecca</font>
what she desired, and avenge her on her enemies; but required
further, that shee would deny God, and relie upon him. Now
there was one <font>Thomas Hart</font> of <font>Lawford</font> , where the said        
<font>Rebecca</font>
<pagebreak id="12" />
lived, with her said mother, <font>Anne West</font> , and the said            
<font>Rebecca</font> told
this Informant, that shee required of him, that hee would avenge
her on the said <font>Hart</font> by killing his son, who not long after was
taken sick, and dyed, whereupon the said <font>Rebecca</font> told this
Informant, that shee conceived hee could do as God; after which time
shee gave entertainment to him, who lay with her as a man; and
the said <font>Rebecca</font> further confessed to this Informant, that whilest
she lived at <font>Rivenall</font> in the said County of <font>Essex</font> , the said 
<font>Anne</font>
her mother, came to the said <font>Rebecca</font> , and told her the Barley   
corn
was picked up (meaning one <font>George Frances</font> (the only son of one
<font>George Frances</font> , one of the chief Inhabitants of that town, where
the said <font>Anne West</font> dwelt) and that his father thought the said
<font>George</font> his son was bewitched to death; and the said <font>Anne</font> then
said unto the said <font>Rebecca</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> be it unto him according to his   
faith.

</dialogue> <head>THE INFORMATION OF <font>SUSAN SPARROW</font> , TAKEN UPON OATH
<font>BEFORE THE SAID JUSTICES THE 25=TH= DAY OF APRILL. AN. DOM.</font> 1645.
<font>AT</font> LITTLE BENTLEY.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Informant saith, That about thirty yeares since, living
under the same roofe with <font>Mary Greenleif</font> of <font>Alresford</font> ,      
either of
them had a Daughter of about thirteen or fourteen yeares of age,
and being one night in bed with their children, this Informant
heard the childe of the said <font>Mary Greenleif</font> to cry out in a      
fearefull
manner;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Mother, now it comes, it comes, oh helpe mother,
it hurts me, it hurts me: </dialogue><nonSpeech>Whereupon this Informant called to the
said <font>Mary</font> and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Good-wife <font>Greenleife</font> , Good-wife       
<font>Greenleife</font> ,
if your childe be asleepe, awaken it, for if any body comes by,
and heare it make such moane (you having an ill name already)
they will say, You are suckling your Impes upon it: </dialogue><nonSpeech>Whereupon
the said <font>Mary</font> replyed;</nonSpeech><dialogue> I doe so indeed, and I will fee with them
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (meaning her said Impes) ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that they shall suck my daughter one
night, and thine another: </dialogue><nonSpeech>And this Informant saith, that the very
next night, her childe cryed out in the same manner, and clasped
her armes about this Informants necke, being much affrighted,
sweating, and shrieking in a terrible manner, complaining that shee
was nipped and pinched on her thigh; and that the next
morning searching what the cause should be, shee found above the right
knee of her childe, a black and blew spot, as broad and long as her
hand: And this Informant saith, that her childe did complaine
on that leg, at least a moneth after. And this Informant saith,
that the house where this Informant and the said <font>Mary</font> did dwell
<pagebreak id="16" />
together, was haunted with a Leveret, which did usually sit before
the dore: And this Informant knowing that one <font>Anthony
Sharlock</font> had an excellent Greyhound that had killed many Hares;
and having heard that a childe of the said <font>Anthony </font> was much
haunted and troubled, and that the mother of the childe suspected
the said <font>Mary</font> to be the cause of it: This Informant went to the
said <font>Anthony Sharlock</font> and acquainted him, that a Leveret did
usually come and sit before the dore, where this Informant and the
said <font>Mary Greenleife</font> lived, and desired the said <font>Anthony</font> to  
bring
downe his Greyhound to see if he could kill the said Leveret;
and the next day the said <font>Anthony</font> did accordingly bring his
Greyhound, and coursed it, but whether the dog killed it this
Informant knows not; But being a little before coursed by Good-man
<font>Merrills</font> dog, the dog ran at it, but the Leveret never stirred,  
and
just when the dog came at it, he skipped over it, and turned about
and stood still, and looked on it, and shortly after that dog
languished and dyed. But whether this was an Impe in the shape of
a Leveret, or had any relation to the said <font>Mary</font> , this Informant
knows not, but does confesse shee wondered very much to see a
Leveret, wilde by nature, to come so frequently and sit openly
before the dore in such a familiar way.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
