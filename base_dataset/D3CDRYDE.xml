<nonSpeech>SCENE LONDON</nonSpeech>

 <head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head> 

<nonSpeech>Failer <font>entring to</font> Burr; <font>who is putting on his Buff-Coat</font> .</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! Not ready yet, Man?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not consider my Voyage from
<font>Holland</font> last night.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pish, a meer Ferry, get up, get up; my
Cousins Maids will come and Blanket thee
anon: Art thou not ashamed to lie a Bed so long?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I may be more ashamed to rise; and so you'l say,   
dear Heart,
if you look upon my Cloaths; the best is, my Buff-coat will cover
all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I gad, there goes more cunning than one would     
think, to the
putting thy Cloaths together: thy Doublet and Breeches are Guelphs
and Ghibellins to one another; and the stiches of thy Doublet are
<pagebreak id="2" />
so far asunder, that it seems to hang together by the Teeth. No
Man could ever guess to what part of the Body these fragments did
belong, unless he had been acquainted with u'm as long as thou hast
been. If they once lose their hold, they can never get together
again, except by chance the Rags hit the Tallies of one another. He
that gets into thy Doublet, must not think to do't by storme; no, he
must win it inch by inch, as the <font>Turk</font> did <font>Rhodes</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are very merry with my Wardrobe: but till I am
provided of a better, I am resolv'd to receive all Visits in this
Truckle-bed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I will first scotch the Wheels of it, that   
it may not
run; thou hast Cattle enough in it, to carry it down stairs, and
break thy neck. 'tis got a yard nearer the door already.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Boy.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   Sir, Mr. <font>Bibber</font> your Taylor's below, and desires to speak with
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's an honest Fellow, and a fashionable, he      
shall set thee
forth I warrant thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, but where's the Money for this dear Heart?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Well, but what think you of being put into a    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Suit of Cloaths, without Money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speak of Miracles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you not know <font>Will. Bibbers</font> humor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prethee, What have I to do with his humor?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Break but a Jest, and he'll beg to trust thee for 
a Suit; nay,
he will contribute to his own destruction; and give thee occasions
to make one: he has been my Artificer these three years; and, all
the while I have liv'd upon his favourable apprehension: Boy,
conduct him up. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Boy.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, What am I the better for this? I ne'r made   
Jeast in
all my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A bare clinch will serve the turn; a Carwichet, a
Quarterquibble, or a Punn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wit from a Low-Countrey-Soldier? One that has
convers'd with none but dull <font>Dutchmen</font> these ten yeares! What an
unreasonable Rogue art thou? why, I tell thee, 'tis as difficult to  
me,
as to pay him ready Money.
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, you shall be rul'd for your own good, Lie   
down;
I'll throw the Cloaths over you to help Meditation; and, upon the
first opportunity, start you up, and surprise him with a Jeast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I think this impossible to be done: but,    
however I'll
attempt.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lies down</font> Failer <font>covers him</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Husht! he's coming up.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bibber.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Morrow Mr. <font>Failer</font> : What, I warrant you think  
I come a
Dunning now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I vow to Gad, <font>Will</font> , I have a better      
opinion of thy
Wit, than to think, thou would'st come to so little purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pretty well that: No, no; my business is to drink  
my 
mornings-Draught in Sack with you:
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will not Ale serve the turn, <font>Will</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had too much of that last night; I was a little  
disguis'd,
as they say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why disguis'd? Hadst thou put on a clean Band, or 
wash'd
thy Face lately? those are thy Disguises, <font>Bibber</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bibb.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, in short, I was drunk; damnably drunk with  
Ale;
great Hogen Mogen bloody Ale: I was porterly drunk, and that I
hate of all things in Nature.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr. Rising:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And of all things in Nature I love it best.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Art thou there I'faith; and why, old Boy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because when I am porterly drunk, I can carry my  
self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha Boy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Porter brings sad Newes to you <font>Will</font> ,    
you must trust
him for a suit of Cloathes, as bad as 'tis: come, h's as honest
Fellow, and loves the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why? it shall be my Suit to him, that I may trust  
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I grant your Suit, Sir,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Burr.</font> Make hast and dress you: Sir            
<font>Timorous</font> Dines here to
day you know him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, I a good honest young Fellow; but, no          
Conjurer; he
and I are very kind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I gad we two have a constant Revenue out of him:  
he
would now be admitted Suitor to my Lady <font>Constance Nonsuch</font> ,
<pagebreak id="4" />
my Lord <font>Nonsuch</font> his Daughter; our Neighbour here in              
<font>Fleetstret</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is the Match in any forwardness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He never saw her before yesterday, and will not   
be brought
to speak to her this Moneth yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's strange.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such a bashful Knight did I never see; but we     
must move
for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They say here's a great Dinner to be made to day   
here, at
your Cousin <font>Trices</font> , on purpose for the enterview.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What he keeps up his old humor still?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes certain; he admires eating and drinking well, 
as much as
ever, and measures every mans wit, by the goodness of his
Palate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who Dines here besides.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Jac. Loveby.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, my Ghest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has ever had the repute of a brave             
clear-spirited Fellow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's one of your Dear Hearts, a Debauche.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I love him the better for't: the best Heraldry of a
Gentleman is a Clap deriv'd to him, from three Generations: What     
fortune
has he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Fortune at all Games; but no Estate: he had  
one;
but he has made a Devil on't long ago: he's a bold Fellow, I vow
to Gad: a person that keeps company with his betters; and
commonly has Gold in's pockets: come <font>Bibber</font> ; I see thou longest 
to
be at thy mornings watering: I'll try what credit I have with the
Butler.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come away my noble Festus and new Customer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now will he drink till his Face be no bigger than a
three-pence.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign> (Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="5" />

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Loveby <font>and</font> Boy; <font>follow'd by</font> Frances
Bibbers <font>Wife</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, the Devil take thee, sweet Landlady, hold thy 
tongue:
Was't not enough thou hast scolded me from my Lodging, which,
as long as I rent it, is my Castle; but to follow me here to Mr.
<font>Trices</font> , where I am invited; and to discredit me before          
strangers, for a
lowsy, Paltry summ of Money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you truely, Mr. <font>Loveby</font> , my husband   
and I cannot
live by Love, as they say; we must have wherewithal, as they
say; and pay for what we take; and so shall you, or some shall
smoak for't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Smoak! why a piece of hung Beef in <font>Holland</font> is  
not more
smoakt, then thou hast Smoak'd me already. Thou know'st I am
now fasting; let me have but fair play; when I have lined my sides
with a good dinner, I'll ingage upon reputation to come home again,
and thou shalt scold at me all the afternoon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll take the Law on you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Law allows none to scold in their own Causes:  
What
do'st thou think the Lawyers take our money for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you intend to deal by my Husband like a
Gentleman, as they say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I should beat him most unmercifully, and not  
pay him
neither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, you think to fobb me off with your Jests   
as you
do my Husband; but it wonn't be: yonder he comes, and
company with him; Husband, husband; why <font>William</font> I say!

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bibber, Burr, <font>and</font> Failer <font>at the other end</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak softly, and I will satisfie thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall not satisfie me, Sir; pay me for what  
you owe
me, for Chamber-rent, and Diet, and many a good thing besides,
that shall be nameless.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a Stygian woman's this to talk thus? hold thy 
tongue
till they be gone, or I'll Cuckold thy husband:
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fran.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You Cuckold him -- would you durst Cuckold him;
I will not hold my Tongue, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yonders my Guest; what say you Gentlemen? shall I  
call
him to go down with us?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must make a loose from her, there's no otherway: 
Save
ye Mr. <font>Failer</font> ; is your Cousin <font>Trice</font> stirring yet: answer me 
quickly
Sir, is you Cousin <font>Trice</font> yet stirring?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll go and see, Sir; sure the man has a mind to  
beat me; but
I vow to Gad I have no mind to be beaten by him: come away
<font>Burr</font> . <font>Will</font> . you'll follow us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll be with you immediately --                    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exeunt</font> Burr. Failer.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was that with <font>Failer</font> , <font>Will</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A man at Armes, that's come from <font>Holland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A man out at Armes thou mean'st, <font>Will</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good I'faith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, I; you run questing up and down after your    
Gambols,
and your Jests <font>William</font> ; and never mind the main chance, as they
say: pray get in you Debts, and think upon your Wife and
Children.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Think upon the Sack at <font>Cary-House</font> , with the   
<font>Apricot</font>
flavour <font>Will</font> . hang a Wife; What is she, but a lawful kind of
Manslayer? every little hugg in bed, is a degree of murdering thee:  
and
for thy Children fear u'm not: thy part of u'm shall be Taylors,
and they shall trust; and those thy Customers get for thee shall be
Gentlemen, and they shall be trusted by their Brethren; and so thy
children shall live by one another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you mark that <font>Frances</font> ? there was wit now; 
he call'd
me Cuckold to my face, and yet for my heart I cannot be angry
with him: I perceive you love <font>Frances</font> , Sir; and I love her the
better for your sake; speak truly, do you not like such a pretty brown
kind of woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do I'faith, <font>Will</font> . your fair Women have no   
substance in u'm
they shrink Ith' wetting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, you may be undone if you will Husband: I   
hear
there are 2 or 3 Actions already out against him: you may be the
last, if you think good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis true she tel's me; I love your wit well Sir;  
but I must
cut my coat according to my cloath.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, we'll come by our own as we can; if you put 
us off
from week to week thus.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but good Landlady --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will good Landlady set on the Pot, as they say;  
or make
the Jack goe; then I'll hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now she's too much on the t'other hand: hold your  
prating
<font>Frances</font> ; or I'll put you out of your Pater Nosters with a       
sorrow to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did but lay the Law open to him, as they say,  
whereby
to get our money in: but if you knew how he had used me Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has he us'd you <font>Frances</font> ; put so much more     
into his Bill
for Lodging.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Honest <font>Will</font> , and so he dy'd; I thank thee     
little <font>Bibber</font> ,
being sober, and when I am drunk, I will kiss thee for't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thank me, and pay me my money, Sir; though I could 
not
forbear my jest, I do not intend to lose by you; if you pay me not
the sooner, I must provide you another Lodging; say I gave you
warning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Against next quarter Landlord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of an hour Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's short warning, <font>Will</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By this hand you shall up into the Garret where    
the little
bed is; I'll let my best room to a better paymaster; you know
the Garret, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, he knows it by a good Token Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sweat to think of that Garret, <font>Will</font> . thou   
art not so
unconscionable to put me there: why 'tis a kind of little ease, to   
cramp
thy rebellious Prentices in; I have seen an Usurers Iron Chest would
hold two on't: a penny Looking-glass cannot stand upright in the
Window, that and the Brush fills it: the Hat-case must be dispos'd
under the Bed, and the Comb-case will hang down from the Seeling
to the Floore. If I chance to Dine in my Chamber, I must stay
till I am empty before I can get out: and if I chance to spill the
Chamber-pot, it will over-flow it from top to bottom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, for the description of the Garret, I'll bate 
you
something of the Bill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All, all, good <font>Will</font> . or to stay thy fury      
till my Rents come
up; I will describe thy little Face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, rather describe your own little money; I am    
sure that's
so Little, it is not visible.
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are ith'right, I have not a cross at present,  
as I am a
sinner; and you will not believe me, I'll turn my Pockets inside
outward -- Ha! What's the meaning of this, my Pockets
heavy? Has my smal Officer put in Counters to abuse me? -- How
now, yellow Boyes, by this good light! Sirrah, Varlet, how came
I by this Gold? Ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Boy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Gold do you mean, Sir? the Devil-a-piece you  
had
this morning: in these last three weeks, I have almost forgot what
my Teeth were made for; last night good Mrs. <font>Bibber</font> here took    
pitty
on me, and crumm'd me a Mess of Gruel, with the Children, and I
popt and popt my Spoon three or four times to my mouth, before I
could find the way to't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis strange, how I should come by so much Money!  
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Has there been no body about my Chamber this morning,
Landlady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Boy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O yes, Sir; I forgot to tell you that: this        
Morning a strange
Fellow, as ever eyes beheld, would needs come up to you when you
were asleep; but when he came down again, he said, He had not
wak'd you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sure this Fellow, who e'r he was, was sent by      
Fortune to
mistake me into so much Money. -- Well, this is not the first time
my necessities have been strangely supply'd: some <font>Cadua</font> or other
has a kindness for me, that's certain: </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Well    
Monsieur
<font>Bibber</font> , from henceforward I'll keep my wit for more refin'd     
spirits;
you shall be payd with dirt; -- there's the Money for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Good Sir. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's your summ? tell it out: Will the Money burn
your fingers? Sirrah, Boy, fetch my Suit with the Gold Lace at
Sleeves from Tribulation -- Gives him Gold. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> Boy.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Mr. <font>Taylour</font> , I shall turn the better Bill-man, and knock that   
little
Coxcomb of yours, if you do not answer me what I owe you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, trouble not your self; 'tis nothing;     
Ifeck now 'tis not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, nothing Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Franc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And't please your worship, it was seventeen      
pounds and a
Noble, yesterday at noon, your worship knows: and then your
worship came home ill last night, and complain'd of your worships    
head;
and I sent for three Dishes of <font>Tea</font> for your good worship, and    
that
was six pence more, and please your worship's honor.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well; there's eighteen pieces, tell u'm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say, <font>Frances</font> , do not take u'm,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, Is all your pleading of necessity come to    
this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I see he will pay, he shall not pay,           
<font>Frances</font> ; go home,
and fetch him the whole bag of forty pounds, I'll lend it him, and
the Lease of the House too; he shall want for nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take the Money, or I'll leave your house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, rather than displease his Worship, take it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She takes it.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, so; go home quietly, and Suckle my God-son,

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Bibber.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my first visit shall be to my Mistriss, the    
Lady <font>Constance
Nonsuch</font> : She's discreet, and how the Devil she comes to love me,
I know not; yet I am pretty confident she loves me: well, no
woman can be wiser than, you know what will give her leave to be.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lady</font> Constance, <font>and Madam</font> Isabella.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look, look; Is not that your Servant, <font>Loveby.</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis she; there's no being seen, till I am better 
habited --
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Loveby.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let him go, and take no notice of him: poor Rogue!
He little thinks I know his poverty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And less, that you supply it by an unknown hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, and falsified my Fathers Keyes to do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can you answer this to your discretion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who could see him want she loves?


</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Setstone.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh here's Mr. <font>Setstone</font> come, your Jeweller,    
Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Welcome <font>Setstone</font> , hast thou perform'd thy   
visit
Happily, and without discovery?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Set.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As you would wish it, Madam: I went up to his
Chamber without interruption; and there found him
Drowning his cares, and pacifying his hunger with sleep;
which advantage I took, and undiscovered by him left
The Gold divided in his Pockets.
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, this Money will furnish him I hope, that   
we may
have his company again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Set.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two hundred and fifty good pounds, Madam! Has your
Father miss'd it yet?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; if he had, we should have all heard on't     
before now:
but, pray God Monsieur <font>Loveby</font> has no other haunts to divert him  
now
he's ransom'd: what a kind of woman is his Landlady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well enough to serve a Taylor; or to kiss when he 
comes
home drunk, or wants money; but, far unlikely to create jealousie
in your Ladiship.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Servant.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Serv.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Justice <font>Trice</font> desires your Ladiships   
excuse, that
he has not yet perform'd the Civilities of his hour to you; he is
dispatching a little business, about which he is earnestly
employed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's Master of his own occasions. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font>    
Servant.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall see him anon, with his face as read, as   
if it had been
boyl'd in pump-water: but, When comes this Miror of Knighthood
that is to be presented you for your Servant?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, 'tis well thought on; 'Faith thou know'st my
affections are otherwise dispos'd; he's rich, and thou want'st a     
Fortune;
atchieve him if thou can'st; 'tis but trying, and thou hast as much
wit as any Wench in <font>England</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On condition you'l take it for a Courtesie to be   
ridd of an
Ass, I care not if I marry him: the old foole, your Father, would
be so importunate to match you with a young Foole, that partly
for quietness sake I am content to take him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To take him! then you make sure on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As sure, as if the Sack Posset were already eaten.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, What means wilt thou use to get him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll bribe <font>Failer</font> , he's the man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why this Knight is his inheritance; he lives     
upon him:
Do'st thou think he'll ever admit thee to govern him? no, he fears
thy wit too much: besides, he has already received an hundred pound
to make thee Match between Sir <font>Timorous</font> and me.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis all one for that; I warrant you he sells me   
Fee-simple of
him.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Nonsuch.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Tempest is risen; I see it in his face; he    
puffs and
blowes yonder, as if two of the Winds were fighting upwards and
downwards in his belly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Set.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will he not find your false Keyes, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope he will have more Humanity then to search us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are come after us betimes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Non.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Child! I am undone; I am robb'd, I am robb'd; I 
have
utterly lost all stomach to my dinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Robb'd! good my Lord how, or of what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Non.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two hundred and fifty pounds in fair Gold out of   
my Study:
an hundred of it I was to have paid a Courtier this afternoon for a
Bribe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Set.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I protest, my Lord, I had as much a do to get that 
parcel of
Gold for your Lordship. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Non.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must get me as much more against to morrow; for
then my Friend at Court is to pay his Mercer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, if that be all, there's no such hast: the     
Courtiers are
not so forward to pay their Debts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has not the <font>Monkey</font> been in the Study? he may 
have
carried it away, and dropt it under the Garden-window: the grass is  
long
enough to hide it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Non.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll go see immediately.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Failer, Burr, Timorous.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the Gentleman, my Lord
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Non.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's wellcome --

Childe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In love with me, my Lord, it is not possible.

raised on
Men of Quality --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Non.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told it me with his own mouth, Child: I'll eat  
words
for no man; that's more then ever I told him yet.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exeunt preter</font> Failer and Burr.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, one thing I had almost forgot to tell you: one

two must ever be near Sir <font>Timerous</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To guard our interest in him from the Enemy Madam
<pagebreak id="15" />
<font>Isabelle</font> ; who, I doubt, has designes upon him. I do not fear    
her wit,
but her sex; she carries a prevailing argument about her.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bibber <font>with a Bottle</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By this hand, I have a light upon the best wine in 
your

forbearance to thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thank you Sir, I'll pledge you -- now here's to you
again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come away; what is't <font>Will</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis what you christened it, a cup of forbearance  
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I drank that to thee <font>Will</font> . that thou    
shouldst forbear
thy money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I drink this to you, Sir; henceforward I'll    
forbear
working for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then say I: take a little Bibber, and throw him   
in the River,
and if he will trust never, then there let him lie ever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then say I: take a little <font>Failer</font> , and throw   
him to the
Jaylour; and there let him lie, till he has paid his Tailor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are very smart upon one another Gentlemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is nothing between us; I use to tell him of  
his Title,
<font>Fiery facias</font> ; and his setting dog, that runs into Ale-houses    
before
him, and comes questing out again, if any of the woots his customers
be within.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I faith 'tis true; and I use to tell him of his    
two Capons tails
about his hat, that are laid spread eagle wise to make a feather; I
would go into the snow at any time, and in a quarter of an hour I    
would
come in with a better feather upon my head; and so farewell Sir; I
have had the better on you hitherto, and for this time I am resolved
to keep it. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Bibber.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The rogue's too hard for me; but the best on't

revenge upon his purse.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Isabelle.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Came not Sir <font>Timerous</font> this way, Gentlemen? he 
left us in

his peace with him.
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madame, I like not your enquiring after Sir       
<font>Timerous</font> : I
suspect you have some design upon him: you would fain undermine
your Cousin, and marry him your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Suppose I should design it; what are you the      
worse for my
good fortune? Shall I make a proposition to you: I know you two
carry a great stroke with him: make the match between us, and
propound to your selves what advantages you can reasonably hope: you
shall chouse him of horses, cloathes and Money, and I'll wink at it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And if he will not be chous'd, shall we beat him   
out on't?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For that, as you can agree.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give us a handsel of the bargain; let us enjoy    
you, and 'tis
a match.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Grammarcy ifaith boyes; I love a good offer how   
e'r the
world goes? but you would not be so base to wrong him that way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I vow to gad but I would Madam: in a horse or a   
woman I
may lawfully cheat my own Father: besides, I know the Knights
complexion; he would be sure to follow other women; and all that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, if he fought with the sword, he should give  
me leave
to fight with the Scabbard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you Madam? is't a bargain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis but a promise; and I have learnt a Court     
trick for
performing any thing </dialogue><nonSpeech> (aside) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Gentlemen, when I am married 
I'll
think upon you; you'll grant there's a necessity I should Cuckold
him, if it were but to prove my self a Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, there's no doubt you'll Cuckold him; and all 
that;
for look you he's a person fit for nothing else; but I fear we shall
not have the graffing of the horns; we must have Livery and Seisin
before hand of you, or I protest to gad we believe you not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have past my word, is't not sufficient? what do  
you think,
I would tell a lie to save such a paltrie thing as a nights lodging?
-- Hark you Sir: </dialogue><nonSpeech> (to <font>Burr</font> .) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now will she attempt <font>Burr</font> ; igad she has      
found him out for
the weaker vessel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have no kindness for that <font>Failer</font> , we'll     
strike him out, and
manage Sir <font>Timerous</font> our selves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed we wonnot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Failer's</font> a Rook, and besides, he's such a      
debauched fellow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Burr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am ten times worse.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Leave it, and him that taught it you: you have     
virtuous
inclinations, and I would not have you ruine your self. He that serves
many Mistresses, surfeits on his diet, and grows dead to the whole
sex: 'tis the folly in the world next long ears and braying.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I'm sure you have a mind to me; when a woman   
once
falls to preaching, the next thing is ever use and application.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forbear your rudeness --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I am sure you meant to jilt me: you decline   
<font>Failer</font>
because he has wit; and you think me such an ass, that you may pack
me off so soon as you are married; no, no, I'll not venture          
certainties for
uncertainties.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can hold no longer; Mr. <font>Failer</font> , what do you 
think this
fellow was saying of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of me, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you were one of the errantest Cowards in      
Christendom,
though you went for one of the Dear Hearts: that your name had
been upon more posts than play-bills: and that he had been
acquainted with you these seven years, drunk and sober, and yet could
never fasten a quarrel upon you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe this, Dear Heart?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you deny it, I'll take his sword, and force you 
to confess it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I vow to gad, this will not do, Madam: you shall

and
overhear thee: no fat overgrown virgin of forty ever offer'd         
her self so dog
cheap, or was more despis'd: me-thinks now this should mortifie
thee exceedingly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not a whit the more for that: Cousin mine, our Sex 
is not
so easily put out of conceit with our own beauties.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Con.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast lost the opinion of thy honesty, and got 
nothing
in recompence: now that's such an oversight in a Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are deceiv'd; they think me too virtuous for  
their

   <nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Loveby</font> . welcome, welcome: where have    
you been this
fortnight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith Madam, out of Town to see a little thing     
that's fallen
to me upon the death of a Grandmother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You thank death for the windfall, Servant: but   
why are
you not in mourning for her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Troth Madam it came upon me so suddenly I had not  
time:
twas a fortune utterly unexpected by me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, was your Grandmother so young you could not  
look 
for her disease?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not for that neither; but I had many other kindred 
whom
she might have left it to, only she heard I liv'd here in fashion, and
spent my money in the eye of the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You forge these things prettily, but I have      
heard you are as
poor as a decimated Cavalier, and had not one foot of land in all
the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rivals tales, Rivals tales, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where lies your land, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you Madam, it has upon it a very fair    
Manor house;
from one side you have in prospect an hanging Garden.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was hang'd there? not your Grandmother I hope?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the midst of it you have a Fountain: you have   
seen that at
<font>Hampton-Court</font> ; it will serve to give you a slight image of it.
Beyond the Garden you look to a River through a Perspective of
fruit-trees; and beyond the River you see a Mead so flowry: well I   
shall
never be at quiet, till we two make hay there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But where lies this Paradice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pox on't; I am thinking to sell it, it has such a  
villanous
unpleasant name; it would have sounded so harsh in a Ladies ear.
But for the Fountain, Madam --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Fountain's a poor excuse, it will not hold   
water; come
the name, the name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith it is come so lately into my hands, that I   
have forgot
the name on't.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isab.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's much, now, you should forget the name, and 
yet
could make such an exact description of the place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will needs know, the name's <font>Bawdy</font> ;     
sure this will give
a stop to their curiosity. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (aside.) </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At least you'll tell us in what County it lies,    
that my Cousin
may send to enquire about it; come, this shall not serve your turn,
tell us any Town that's near it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twill be somewhat too far to send; it lies in the 
very North
of <font>Scotland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In good time, a Paradice in the <font>Highlands</font> ;    
is't not so Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seems you went Post, Servant: in troth you    
are a rank
rider, to go to the North of <font>Scotland</font> , stay and take            
possession, and
return again, in ten days time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never knew your Grandmother was a <font>Scotch</font>     
woman: is she
not a <font>Tartar</font> too: pray whistle for her, and lets see her daunce: 
come
-- whist Grannee!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie fie Servant; what no invention in you? all   
this while
a studying for a name of your Manor? come, come, where lyes it?
tell me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No faith, I am wiser than so; I'll discover my     
Seat to no
man; so I shall some damn'd Lawyer keep a prying into my title
to defeat me of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How then shall I be satisfied there is such a    
thing in
Nature?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell me what Jewel you would wear, and you shall   
have it:
Enquire into my money, there's the trial.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since you art so flush, Sir, you shall give me a 
Locket of
Diamonds of three hundred pounds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was too severe; you know he has but a 250     
<font>l.</font> to bestow.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>to her.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well you shall have it, Madam: but I cannot        
higgle: I
know you'll say it did not cost above 200 pieces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll be hanged if he does not present you with a   
parcel of melted
Flints set in Gold, or <font>Norfolk</font> pebbles.

I have appointed business, to morrow I'll wait upon you with it.

 <head>ACT. III.</head> 

<nonSpeech>Constance, Isabelle.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas ill luck to have the meeting broke last    
night,
just as <font>Setstone</font> was coming towards him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But in part of recompence you'll have the
pleasure of putting him on farther streights, O,
these little mischiefs are meat and drink to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He shall tell me from whence he has his Money:   
I am
resolv'd now to try him to the utmost.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would devise something for him to do, which he   
could not
possibly perform.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I live yonder he comes with the Jewel in his  
hand he
promis'd me; prithee leave me alone with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Isa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speed the Plough; if I can make no sport I'll      
hinder none:
I'll to my Knight, Sir <font>Timirous</font> ; shortly you shall hear newes   
from
<font>Damaetas</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Isabelle.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Loveby.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you Madam, here's the Jewel; do me the favor to
accept it, and suppose a very good Complement deliver'd with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Believe me a very fair Jewel: but, Why will you  
be at this
needless charge? What acknowledgment do you expect? you know
I will not Marry you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How the Devil do I know that; I don not conceive   
my self
under correction, so inconsiderable a person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'll alter your partial opinion, when I tell   
you 'tis not
a flash of wit fires me; nor is it a gay out-side can seduce me to
Matrimony.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am neither Fool, nor deform'd so much as to be
despicable. What do I want?
<pagebreak id="28" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A good Estate, that makes every thing handsome;  
nothing
can look well without it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Does this Jewel express poverty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I conjure you by your love to me, tell me one    
truth not
minc'd by your invention: How came you by this Jewel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis well I have a Voucher; pray ask your own      
Jeweller
<font>Setstone</font> , if I did not buy it of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How glad you are now, you can tell a truth so    
near a lie:
but, Where had you the Money that purchas'd it? come, -- 
without circumstances and preambles --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Umh, -- perhaps that may be a secret.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say it be one; yet he that lov'd indeed, could   
not keep
it from his Mistriss.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why should you be thus importunate?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I cannot think you love me, if you will  
not trust
that to my knowledge, which you conceal from all the World
beside.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You urge me deeply --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, sweet Servant, you shall tell me; I am     
resolv'd to
take no denial: Why do you sigh?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I be blasted it must out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Either tell me, or resolve to take your leave    
forever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then know I have my means; I know not how.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a fine secret.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then if you will needs know; 'tis from the     
Devil; I
have Money from him, what, and when I please.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seal'd a Covenant, and given away your  
Soul for
Money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No such thing intended on my part.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not yet what conditions he'll propose: I    
should
have spoke with him last night, but that a cross chance hinder'd
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, my opinion is, some great Lady that is in  
love with
you, supplies you still; and you tell me an incredible Tale of the
Devil, meerly to shadow your infidelity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Devise some meanes to try me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I take you at your word; you shall swear freely  
to bestow
<pagebreak id="29" />
on me, what ever you shall gain this unknown-way; and for a proofe,
because you tell me you can have Money, what and when you please;
bring me an hundred pounds e'r night: (If I do marry him for a
Wit) I'll see what he can do; he shall have none from me.            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You overjoy me, Madam; you shall have it, and 'twere
twice as much.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How's this!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Devil a cross that I have; or know where to    
get; but
I must promise well to save my credit: now Devil, if thou do'st
forsake me! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I mistrust you; and therefore if you faile, I'll 
have your
hand to show against you; here's inke and paper

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Burr <font>and</font> Timorous.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What makes <font>Loveby</font> yonder? he's Writing somewhat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll go see. -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Lookes over him.) </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you no more manners then to overlook a man when
he's a Writing? -- Oh, Is't you Sir <font>Timorous</font> ? you may stand     
still;
now I think on't you can not read Written hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are very familiar with Sir <font>Timorous</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So I am with his Companions Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bur.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then there's hopes you and I may be better         
acquainted: I
am one of his Companions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By what title, as you are an Ass Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Const.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No more Loveby. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lov.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I need not Madam; alass this fellow is onely the   
Sollicitor
of a quarrel, till he has brought it to an head; and I will leave the
fighting part to the Curteous pledger. Do not I know these fellows?  
you
shall as soon perswade a Mastiff to fasten on a Lyon, as one of      
these to
ingage with a courage above their own: they know well enough who 
they can beat, and who can beat them.
