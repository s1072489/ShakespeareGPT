CVRRY-COMBE
FOR A COX-COMBE.</head> 

 <head>CHAP. I.
<font>THE LIBELLERS MALICE, PRIDE, FRAUD, AND
FOLLY DETECTED.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, honest <font>Nick</font> !
Welcome into <font>Sheppy</font> . How
fares the noble Knight,
and all the true Trojans
at home?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thanke God
Sir, all well. My Master
remembers his loue to your Worship, to you Master
Vicar, and to all his friends in these parts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are much bound to him for his kinde
remembrance; but I wonder what winde driues you
<pagebreak id="2" />
hither? we may strew greene rushes for you; I thinke
you were neuer heere since Master Maior tooke his
oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you are in the right, but such
troublesome guests come soone enough, like foule weather,
before they be sent for.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay say not so <font>Nick</font> , the worst dogge in your
masters house cannot come vnwelcome to
<font>Queenborough</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's more of your kindnesse then our
merit; but I pray you what's the reason the bowling
greene is so emptie vpon so faire a day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why man, there is a great Faire at
<font>Sittingburne</font> , thither they are all gone, tag, rag and
longtaile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I feare I am come at an ill time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My master hath sent me for the pyde nagge,
hee would haue him runne in <font>Iames</font> parke, lest hee
spoile himselfe this drie season: besides, I haue
appointed the Smith to bee heere in the afternoone.
Now if the Castle-keeper bee gone to buy
Hobbyhorses too, I am in a faire case.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To put you out of doubt, vpon my
knowledge he is ridde out, more then an houre and a halfe
since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then it is likely to be darke night before he
finde the way home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Assure your selfe of that; it is a forfeit for a
Sheppy-man to come from a Faire till Sunne set.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sue the ill lucke; and the worst is, I know
<pagebreak id="3" />
not how to spend the time all this liue-long day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As if I haue not a good dish of Oysters,
and a cold pye at home to hold you tacke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Many thankes good Master Maior: but in
very deed I brake my fast so well with our old
Gardiner at <font>Vpberry</font> before I came out, that I shall haue
little mawe to any meate till night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then what will you doe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my little honestie I know not, vnlesse
some good bodie would lende mee a Play-booke to
make my worship laugh.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith <font>Nick</font> I doe not remember any such in
my custodie, but our Searcher lent me a merry book
which came to his hands the last weeke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you meane that squibbing pamphlet
against Sir <font>Edward Hoby</font> , which I borrowed of you
yesterday morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The very same: I would you would take
the paines to fetch it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That labour shall be saued, we neuer parted
companies since we met.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now if you bee kinde gentlemen, let vs sit
downe yonder, vpon Pennylesse Bench, and
suruey it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Agreed; for I thinke wee shall haue no
bodie in hast come to trouble vs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What may the title of the booke bee? and
who is the Author?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He may be <font>Nicholas nemo</font> , for ought I know,
he discouers himselfe only by the marke of I. R.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare lay a good wager it is that <font>Ishmael
<pagebreak id="4" />
Rabshacheh</font> , whom my Master so hampred in his
<font>Cou~ter-snarle</font> : my minde giues me it is the same <font>Gurgullio</font> ,
whose late arriuall makes him so much merriment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not vnlike: hee hath wonne the spurres
for an arch-rayler. The most rauing, and brauing
<font>Pasquil</font> that euer I read. Had he gotten any prize by his
last worke, you should haue now seene him out of
his maskers sute: he stands close behinde his picture:
if it passe currant, he will then peepe out, otherwise
he will hide his head in a Bench-hole.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But is this the fashion of professed
Diuines, to broach Positions which they dare not
justifie with the subscription of their names, and being
namelesse themselues, to perbreake persons of note.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe you wonder at that? As if old
pursetakers will present themselues in their owne likenes
without <font>vizards</font> , and <font>scarfes</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeede that were the next way to the
Gallowes; but surely this kinde of cunning
ioyned with so great scurrility (which in my little view
I discouered) would make me shrewdly suspect their
sinceritie, who are so intemperate in their owne
affections, and regardlesse of better mens credits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the Catholike charitie, and
soulegaining patience practised now adayes; but he is not
without his shifts. That he concealeth his name, it
is his humilitie, as regardlesse of wordly respects.
That hee is so tarte, it proceedeth from his zeale of
the cause, not any hatred of the person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In my opinion he needs not feare any great
applause for the extraordinary skil of his work. T'is
<pagebreak id="5" />
well if he scape in this learned age without reproof.
But to make zeale the Patron for his personall
frumps, is intollerable hypocrisie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Could he shew any such sparkes of
personall disdaine, flying from Saint <font>Augustines</font> penne,
there were yet some little hope, that hee hath at least
a dramme of that <font>Primitiue Spirit</font> : but you shall
heare how he contradicts himselfe. Saint
<font>Augustine</font> (saith he) <font>did endeauour to curbe the motions of
anger, seeking to ouercome his Aduersaries, not by returne
of iniurious reproaches, to disgrace their persons, but by
cleare Demonstrations of the victorious truth</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then is hee as like Saint <font>Augustine</font> , as an
Owle to an Iuie bush.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And could hee single out no body but my
Master to make the Anuill of his malice? I doubt hee
hath taken a wrong Sowe by the eare; if his coate
be not swingd' well and thriftily, let me bee held for
a sowced Gurnet.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeede it had beene the wiser way, first to
haue beleguered the Castle which he formerly lost;
and had not either vaine hope of a second voluntarie
lapse, or necessarie feare of some foule discouerie,
diuerted his force, hee would rather haue followed
the chase of his olde prey. Well, hee is not vnlike to
haue some hornets about his eares: But for Sir
<font>Edward</font> , hee hath passed his word to answere him with
comtempt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Silence verily is fittest for a Gentleman of
his place, vnlesse his aduersarie were of more worth
then his Start-vp.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wonder in my heart what <font>Ishmael</font> meant
to come vpon him with a fresh reply, hauing publike
notice of his resolution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was it that animated him; the Knights
<font>Dormitabo</font> secur'd his pen free passage without
controll.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, then I would my girdle might breake;
seeing he will wake a sleeping Lyon, as long as I can
hold a <font>Currie-combe</font> in my hand, I will ferret his sides
till he crie <font>Flebo</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue thou art true bred; such a
Whelp is fittest for this game: But how camest thou
by thy Latin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, I waited on a yong Gentleman, at
<font>Oxford</font> , some three, or foure yeares, where I got a
few broken ends together, enough to patch <font>Rabsh.</font>
his Cox-combe with a <font>Sternigogulus</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On my soule thou art a merrie grigge. I
would not for the price of a good Breake-fast haue
wanted thy companie in the reuiew of this discourse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps you will say so, by that time wee
haue done; It shall goe hard if I find not Crotchets
in this Beetle-head, to descant vpon his plaine song.
But I long to heare the bookes name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is called <font>Purgatories Triumph ouer Hell</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! <font>Ishmael</font> the Conqueror? O
victorious <font>Rabshacheh</font> . In what pompe art thou led to the
Capitoll?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would you know how? his Charriot is
drawne with foure grisly <font>Anticques</font> : <font>Sophistrie</font> ,
<font>Scurrilitie</font> , <font>Impudencie</font> , and <font>Hypocrisie</font> , and attended 
with
<pagebreak id="7" /> 
<font>Falshood</font> , <font>Philosophie</font> , <font>Atheisme</font> , and <font>Idolatrie</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he triumph after the old Roman maner,
he must (for the gaining of applause) be very liberall
in his gifts to the people.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee passeth for that of all that euer I knew.
Here he flings a <font>Rams horne</font> , there a <font>Tobacco pipe</font> ; here
hee bestowes a <font>Black-more Girle</font> of his owne taking;
there hee casts our <font>Ladies Gloues</font> . <font>Asses</font> are his
ordinarie fauours; and as for <font>Wine, Suger, Honnie-sops, Greene
Goslings, Cocatrices, Wood-cockes, Cockes egges</font> , and
<font>Sallets</font> , you would admire his lubberalitie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stop there good <font>M. Vicar</font> , <font>Nickes</font> teeth will
water, if you talke of any more such Iunckets.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No not if hee gaue <font>Quailes</font> insteede of
<font>Woodcockes</font> ; these dainterils haue layen so long vpon his
hands, that I feare me they are scarce sweete.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His last Treatise, (if I be well aduised) 
wherein hee began to fling at the Knight, was Christned,
<font>The ouerthrow of the Protestants pulpit Babels</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Ouerthrow</font> ? <font>O Hercules!</font> They must bee
Bables indeed if he bee able to moue them. What a
braue Lad is this, that dreames of nothing but
Ouerthrowes, and Triumphs? No doubt hee rescued
many Shauelings in this skirmish. Twas pittie hee
was not in <font>England</font> when my Lord <font>DelaWare</font> 
vndertooke his voyage: Then should his Lordship haue
had no neede to haue stood to the curtesie of the
two Vniuersities. <font>Rabshacheh</font> alone would haue soon
brought those poore Sauages, vnder the belt of his
Discipline. But had he not great lucke (trow you) to
scape <font>Cerberus</font> his fanges, comming so neere the
confines of Hell?
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He complayneth that he met with a
<font>Cerberus</font> , meaning the Knights <font>Counter-snarle</font> , <font>Which
entertained him with an vnfriendly welcome, and
saluted his pinnace with a peale of vnlouely termes</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And well worthie, for hee gaue the onset
without a challenge, neither came he as a <font>Merchant</font>
(according to his colourable pretence) <font>with an Oliue
branch, towards the hauen of his fauour</font> ; but as a man
of Warre with a flagge <font>of defiance</font> , to batter the
invincible Fort of the Knights reputation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay by your leaue, S=r=. <font>Edward</font> cast out his
Gloue to any <font>Romified Rennegado</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was that to <font>I. R.</font> ? what needed hee
haue fought as the Popes Voluntarie, vnder those
colours? Had he such interest in the Title, that hee
could not forbeare the Claime?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for that, it had beene pardonable, if in
the confidence of his cause, hee had endeauoured to
disable the Knights refutation of <font>Purgatorie</font> , by the
<font>Dint of argument</font> . but to <font>dart his Porcupine quills</font> to
blemish his credit, to <font>snuffe at a Tobacco pipe, to iest
with his sword</font> , nay to make him a <font>Pedler</font> to vent
other mens patches, as it argueth rather an aking
tooth, then a religious minde, so is it able to driue
<font>Sobrietie</font> her selfe into an <font>arring passion</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had the <font>Cumaean Virgin</font> , I meane Discretion,
beene his guide in that journey; <font>had the respect of the
Knights honor, or desire of well-fare of his soule</font> , beene
superintendent in his thoughts, hee would haue
found another way to the wood. 'Tis strange
<font>Rhetorique</font> to alienate his affections, whose <font>Iudgments</font> we
labour to informe.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you haue the right? I haue gotten the
length of his foote. <font>Prurit-anus Wilson</font> sees that
<font>Ishmael</font> hath a Wind-mill in his head, therefore hee
buzzeth in his eares to set the clapper a iogge, that so
he may get a good Grist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had there not been some such pecuniary, or
sinister ayme, I verily thinke <font>Rabshacheh</font> his pen had
beene at a full period. Hee would haue accepted the
Knights reasonable satisfaction, and endured a little
showre, especially raised by the blustring windes of
his owne distemper: hee would not haue prouoked
the grimme Porter the second time, whom he found
so fell at the first. Somewhat it is that makes him so
bray in the eares of his supposed <font>Cerberus</font> , who was
well contented to haue taken a nappe, and to let him
passe without regard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet would he make the world beleeue hee
is so desirous of peace, that hee hath now out of the
aboundance of his charity brought him a <font>hony sop</font>
to stop his mouth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Trust mee truly, hee comes ouer him with
kindnesse; this hony was not fetched from the <font>Bees</font>
hiue, but from the <font>Aspes</font> hole, more like to stir choller
then to procure rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This tricke he learned in his passage of
<font>Charon</font> the Ferriman; to looke towards <font>peace</font> with his
face, and rowe towards <font>discord</font> with his pen. He sets
out the <font>Oliue branch</font> for a signe, but his vessels are
full of gall and wormewood within.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we may take his owne word in his owne
worke, it is the <font>gentle sound of a solid answere, It is a
<pagebreak id="10" />
purgatory sallet to purge his prophane humours, made of
fiue medicinable hearbs, wherein he hath powred the oyle
of charitable exhortations, mingled with the vineger of
sharpe reprehension, yet so sparingly that it cannot be
displeasing to his tast</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If hee had presented him with the iuice of
<font>Rue</font> , and <font>skymd hony</font> , it had beene more proper for
the dimnesse of his sight. It seemes he hath not been
brought vp vnder an <font>Apothecary</font> , but rather in a
<font>Cookes</font> shop, he is so cunning in dishing out this
saucy <font>Allegory</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What will ye say then to this? <font>I haue done
my best to quench the fire which flashed from the
bramble bush of your distempered thoughts, not with cold
water of a dull deniall, nor with the oyle of sinners, which
might increase the flame, by soothing you in your errour,
but with wine and sugar.</font> I hope you will not taxe this
to be broken-winded.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I promise you an excellent close. Had my
master such a <font>Skull</font> in his kitchin, that would quench
the fire with <font>wine</font> and <font>sugar</font> , the <font>Vintners</font> and
<font>Grocers</font> would soone share his lands: his patrimony
would then be in a dangerous consumption indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nick</font> , you are somewhat too quicke, his
honest meaning is to bee accepted: yet if I haue any
iudgement, hee is more elegant in one leafe of this
booke, then in all the other he wrote before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry hee may thanke Sir <font>Edward</font> for that,
whose phrases are so interlaced throughout the
whole discourse, that <font>Rabshacheh</font> his stile may seeme
to haue put on her holli-day coate.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This one thing I heard a Gentleman of good
quality obserue, that hee hath an extraordinary gift
in the retorting of conceipts: And withall protested
that he thought <font>Ishmael</font> was begotten on the side of
a hill, he so returns word for word like an Eccho.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The truth is, the poore man hath a very
weake stomacke, hee casts vp whole periods as they
went downe, without digestion or alteration.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I were his Phisition, I would prescribe him
a cup of wine and sugar next his heart, for what with
his <font>watching</font> , <font>weeping</font> and <font>whipping</font> , he hath a very
bad stomacke, and a worse braine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He ill deserues it, who measures other mens
liquor, by the shallow panne of his owne wheeling
skonce. If hee breake his fast with nymble-brained
<font>Wilson</font> somewhat more liberally, hee strait fumbles
in the mouth, and tumbles out a <font>double foole</font> in
euery answere according to his <font>simple folly</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was not then mistaken that did
<font>Hierogliphick</font> him by the name of <font>Rabshacheh</font> , which vpo~ long
search he hath found to signifie <font> <foreign>Multum Ebrius</foreign> </font> : as
much to say, as <font>Cozen German</font> to <font>Floud</font> the <font>Ignatian</font> ,
who hath in his time made more razling Indentures,
then the best Scriuener in <font>Doway</font> or S=t=. <font>Omers</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet as flustred as hee was, when his wench
told him that he kissed like a Clowter, hee could text
her with <font> <foreign>Labia Sacerdotis custodiunt sapientiam</foreign> </font> . And
when shee pleaded that it went against her heart, he
could protest by the faith of a Catholique, not to
come within a foote of her conscience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seemes indeed he speakes not by guesse
<pagebreak id="12" />
like a <font>Nouice</font> , but as one beaten to the trade by
experimentall proofe, when he saith, <font>I know that the
custome of men that are tipled is, when they stagger
themselues, to thinke that Churches, and the very heauens reele
about them</font> . Marke how feelingly he speakes euen of
the thought.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let him be what he will, this is no fit Court
to draw his Inditement: hee will trauerse it with an
<font>Appeale</font> ; Let vs rather heare how he bestirs himselfe
for Purgatory.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay by your leaue Sir, his Apology
touching the exceptions in the <font>Counter-snarle</font> must haue
the precedence. This hath he cunningly in his first
chapter prefixed to a worke; by good probability,
long studied, against the Knights first letter, some
sixe yeares since directed to M=r=. <font>T. H.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bee it as it list: seeing wee are come as
<font>Auditors</font> to sitte vpon his account, let vs first see his
charge, and then his discharge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed equity her selfe cannot prescribe a
more indifferent course then this. There is great
reason your <font> <foreign>fiat</foreign> </font> should stand in these <font>praecincts</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt he hath placed a Lion in the
forefront to make the better way, for the Marshalling of
his weaker and more heartlesse troopes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he haue the least dramme of Rhetoricall
Chiualry, he will be sure to put the best legge
formost.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are both wide; in stead of a Lion, hee
hath committed the conduct of his forces to <font>Reynald</font>
the foxe, whom hee presents on his paper stage with
<pagebreak id="13" />
a Target, to shield him from the imputation <font>of
vttering any thing to the Knights reproach</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It must be a nimble Foxe that can shift off
so many palpable wrongs; hee had neede haue his
ioynts thoroughly annointed with the oyle of
leazing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doubt you not that; his poynts are well
tagg'd with <font>fraud</font> . And first, as if hee (good man)
meant nothing but pure deuotion, hee deplores the
<font>hard hap of his infortunate treatise, in falling vpon so
vndeserued misconstruction</font> , wishing that the few lines
which concerned the <font>Knight</font> , <font>had beene read by him
when he was fasting</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee were a wise man would loose a good
Breakfast, for better repast then I could euer
discouer in his Larder. It seemes his booke is somewhat a
kinne to an <font>Apothecaries</font> drugge, which requires the
attendance of an houre-glasse, and a Spanish <font> <foreign>seruicio</foreign> </font> .
Hee that dares not but allow a certaine number of
Psalms in our Ladies Psalter to be read after supper,
is angry if his owne lines bee perused when a man
hath dined. If there bee any such danger in taking
his receits vpon a full stomack, he should haue done
well to prescribe both diet and time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Vndoubtedly hee hath a reference to the
<font>wine</font> and <font>sugar</font> , mentioned in his Preface, which
liquor he saith the Knight loues well. This holy
water runnes from his pen in such aboundance as if he
had <font>Bacchus</font> his tunne for a Standish: hee dreames of
no body but <font>Ennius</font> , who in his merry veyne wrote
more wise sentences, then euer issued from
<pagebreak id="14" />
<font>Rabshacheh</font> his most sober thoughts; heerein he displayeth
his folly, or rather his malice, in the highest degree.
But the best is, he is like to purchase as much thanks
of the iudicious Reader, by this his iniurious
<font>scandall</font> , as <font>Sophocles</font> his vngracious Sonnes got by
traducing their old Father for a Dotard, and so vnfit for
the management of his estate. The Knight is able
to shew him more then a <font>Tragedy</font> to wipe away this
blurre: where <font>Malice</font> is the prompter, you must
imagine <font>Impudency</font> will deliuer a good euidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Ecce potator vini</foreign> </font> , <comment type="compiler">GREEK OMITTED</comment> are
no new inuentions, nor grounded truths: as if a
Gentleman cannot drinke a cup of wine but hee must
instantly be as wise as staring <font>Gaal</font> . The Knight is of
an affable, and pleasant disposition, yet hee comes
not alwaies vp to <font>Hilary</font> Tearme. <font>Vlisses</font> was no
Plough-man, though once for a priuate end he
fained himselfe a Rusticke, and put his hands to the
share. <font>Cato</font> was vpbraided for being all night in a
tauerne, but how did hee answere for himselfe? <font>You
should relate</font> (quoth he) <font>how many daies before I spent at
my booke, and neuer budg'd out of my study</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Ishmael</font> cannot heare with that eare: Hee
should haue shewed more discretion in shaping his
credulous <font>Censures</font> , according to the prescript of this
direction; had he <font>Itemd</font> the <font>lampe oyle</font> , as well as hee
summed the <font>Spanish</font> wine, his intruding curiosity
would haue passed with lesse blame. <font> <foreign>Nemo omnibus
horis sapit.</foreign> </font> Hee that is lumpish at his meales, will
proue but a slug in his more serious affaires.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure the old Frier was of your minde
<pagebreak id="15" />
in this; for handling those words <font> <foreign>Vinum non
habent</foreign> </font> , He made his diuision thus. Here is first <font> <foreign>vinum,
ibi optimus liquor</foreign> </font> . Secondly, <font> <foreign>non habent, ibi pessimus
clamor</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gra-mercy <font>Nick</font> , I perceiue thou hast not left
all thy Latine shreads at home. But I would gladly
know what the Knight mistooke in the perusall of
his discourse that he should be thus charged with an
<font>inconsiderate suruey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Knight (if you be remembred) tooke
it in ill part that hee was taxed by the <font>Cecropidan for
want of learning, wit, valour</font> , and <font>conscience</font> , as also with
the <font>surplussage of selfe-conceit</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And can hee either blame the acceptance,
or deny the cause, which is yet extant vnder his own
hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, hee forsooth doth not simply
derogate from the Knight in any of these, but
comparatiuely matching them together, giues the
precedence, where he thinks he had most cause. <font>I did
diuide</font> (saith he) <font>the three degrees of comparison, betwixt
your three most commendable qualities, Valour, Learning,
Witte. I gaue the positiue to your valour; The 
comparatiue I did assigne to your pen: To your wit I did reserue
the superlatiue degree: my conceit did without fraude,
sincerely aime at your praise. If I did preferre your wit &amp;
Learning before your Valour, you haue no iust cause of
offence</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were there no more but this, it is more then
common Ciuility can well warrant; had hee not bin
ill tutord hee might haue learned that comparisons
<pagebreak id="16" />
are odious. Might not the Knights commendable
qualities say vnto him, <font> <foreign>Quis te constituit iudicem inter
nos</foreign> </font> ? The question <font> <foreign>de primatu</foreign> </font> was not allowable
amongst the Disciples. In this case <font> <foreign>diuidatur</foreign> </font> , shewes
little care of the whole. The Poet might haue
informed him, <font> <foreign>Quae non prosunt singula, iuncta iuuant</foreign> </font> : he
that hath but an vnce of each of those former
properties, wants not a graine of a worthy man. So that
by sundring them he labours to lessen their esteem,
and by disparaging that which he seemes to hold in
highest regard, hee plainly nullifies the repute of the
rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee that hath but halfe an eye, may easily
perceiue his comparatiue praises, to be indeede
priuatiue disgraces: as you may see by his Comment
vpon his owne text. For wheras he stiled the Knights
booke an <font>vnlearned Letter</font> , he now explanes himselfe,
that the want of <font>Philosophicall and Theologicall
verities occasioned that censure</font> . <font>The learning</font> (saith hee)
<font>with want whereof I charged your Letter, is neither
Pernassian, nor Poeticall, nor Prophane, but Sacred, Holie
and Deuine</font> .
   Is this the comparatiue degree wherewith hee
dubs his pen? <font> <foreign>Est aliquid prodire tenus</foreign> </font> : seeing
<font>Rabshacheh</font> will afford no more, tis well wee haue this. But
such a Boone is not like long to be enioyed. I feare
<font>Rabshacheh</font> repents himselfe already of his seeming
bounty; For as if his pen had beene ouer lauish, hee
doth interpret the <font>Pernassian learning</font> formerly
acknowledged, to signifie <font>Fustian phrases, nullity of
iudgement without any mediocrity of Logicke, a slippery
<pagebreak id="17" />
veyne of writing, impertinent and ridiculous
annotations, language that must haue a Parliament to naturalize
it, witlesse cauils, babbling able to make learned mens
heads ake, speech not so wise as the braying of Balaams
Asse, a gaudy stile, a head blanke without matter,
defiling, nay loading his margent with all manner of
impertinent stuffe, as vulgar sentences, triuiall verses,
childish authors, reeling, tottering, and ridiculous
phrases, seruing only to wast inke and to blurre paper</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I promise you he hath mended the matter
well, these milde censures are able to raise <font>fits of
choler</font> . Is this the <font>Pernassian Lawrell</font> with which hee is
content to crowne my Masters temples? Is this the
tune which the <font>poeticall sisters sing in Apolloes quire</font> ?
then may the gingling of my <font>Curry-combe</font> passe
currant for reasonable good melody. I easily beleeue
hee went <font>young from Helicon</font> , who can no better
iudge of those Christall streames.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If a man should giue <font>Floud</font> this attribute, that
he is <font> <foreign>tam Philosophiae, quam theologiae peritus</foreign> </font> , which
(bearing a double construction) may be warranted,
albeit he haue beene scarce seasoned with the
Principles of eyther Science, and so a Dullard in both:
how could he but hold himselfe ill handled, if
afterward the same party should tell him that he shewed
more <font>foolery</font> then <font>Philosophy</font> , more <font>Dunsery</font> then
<font>Diuinity</font> ? But the best is, (as I heard the Knight once say)
he makes no more reckoning of his praise, in giuing
him that hee had not, then of his dispraise, in taking
from him that he had; as hauing neither more nor
lesse, for either of both.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet this comes short of <font>Rabshacheh</font> his
equiuocating straine. For did hee sincerely ayme at the
Knights praise in his grant <font>of Pernassian learning</font> , why
doth hee then gainelay it in those his contradictory
imputations? or did his mentall entendment seeke
the disparagement of the Knights learning (as now
the euent hath made apparant) to what ende then
doth he protest the sincerity of his good meaning?
Why doth he labour to colour his former frumpe
with a distinction of learning, yeilding the lesser arm
of that tree to the Knight, and keeping the greater
(as purchased by his long study and delight) to
himselfe? whereas in fine he dispossesseth him of all,
euen of the least leafe of the smallest branch.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus is the Foxe now vncased, his <font>Flag</font>
of due respect, and <font>dutifull affection</font> , prooued to bee
but the <font>Ensigne of Subtilty</font> : but I would gladly see
vpon what ground he buildeth those his
derogatory and disgracefull termes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forsooth he hath gotten the wind of an
opposition betweene the Knights <font>poetry</font> , and his <font>prose</font> ,
and that in the first sentence of his <font>Counter-snarle</font> ,
which he produceth as a <font>perspectiue vnto the rest</font> . 
<font>Heresie</font> (saith hee) <font>hath in all ages contriued artificiall
shadowes, which he iustifieth with this marginall verse</font> .
<font> <foreign>Artibus impietas ingeniosa caret?</foreign> </font> This <font>Rabshacheh</font>      
reading
without an Intergatory saith, <font>that the marginall Muse
gainsaith the text</font> , whereas the argument is drawne
<font> <foreign>ab impossibili, vizt.</foreign> </font> that it cannot be that <font>witty
Impiety</font> should be to seeke of cunning conueighance, then
which nothing can bee more sutable to the purpose.
<pagebreak id="19" />
But admit there were no dash visible to his squinting
eyes, besides the full poynt, yet might his wisdome
haue taken it for spoken <font>Ironically</font> , in which
acceptation it is no lesse then <font>vnicent</font> to the <font>Prose</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tut, this Make-bate hath no other proiect
but to set <font>Ephraim</font> against <font>Manasses</font> , and <font>Manasses</font>
against <font>Ephraim</font> , to cast a bone betweene the
<font>Margent</font> , and the <font>Text</font> , and to set them both together
by the eares with the truth: but the best is, the least
dash of a pen will easily reconcile them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay this is not all, hee challengeth the <font>Prose</font>
also, as <font>notoriously false</font> , in auerring that the
<font>countenance of venerable Antiquity is the artificiall colour
wherwith Heresie doth paint her selfe, whereas</font> (saith he)
<font>Heresie hath in all ages disclaimed the Award of Antiquity</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I am sure our Preacher deliuered
false doctrine the last Sunday, for hee spake much of
<font> <foreign>Patrem habemus Abrahamum</foreign> </font> , and I remember hee
had such a word as <font> <foreign>Templum Domini</foreign> </font> , which was
frequent (as he said) in the mouth of the <font>Idolatrous</font> and
<font>Hypocriticall Iewes</font> . Hee spake somewhat also of the
<font>Adamians</font> , who vouched nothing but Antiquity,
and of the <font>Acephali</font> who pleaded the authority of
<font>Athanisius</font> and <font>Cyril</font> for the passage of their heresie:
the particulars are crept out of my slippery braine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee might further haue informed you of
the Heretique <font>Dioscorus</font> , who in the open <font>Councell</font>
did vant of the Pedegree and descent of his doctrine,
from all the ancient Fathers of the Church. <font> <foreign>Ego
testimonia habeo sanctorum patrum, Athanasij, Gregorij
&amp;c. Ego defendo patrum dogmata.</foreign> </font> <font>I haue the witnesse</font>
<pagebreak id="20" />
(saith hee) <font>of the holy Fathers; I defend the Fathers
doctrine</font> . Was not <font>Carosus</font> an Heretique? yet forsooth
he did beleeue, <font> <foreign>secundum expositionem trecentorum
decem et octo patrum</foreign> </font> ; <font>according to the exposition of the
three hundred and eighteene Fathers</font> . If the <font>Plea</font> of
<font>Antiquity</font> were not a glistering varnish, <font>Andreas
Barbatius</font> would not haue gone so high to fetch the descent
of his <font>Romish Cardinalls</font> grounding their foundation
vpon those words of <font>Hannah</font> , <font> <foreign>Domini sunt Cardines
terra, et posuit super eos orbem</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee might haue shewen himselfe a more
skilfull Herauld, and gone neerer the sound, &amp; sence,
had he drawne their originall from these wordes of 
the Apostle: <font> <foreign>Vos autem carnales estis</foreign> </font> ; but these
<font>Arcadians</font> must bee a day or two elder then the Moone,
or else they will hold themselues no Gentlemen:
their holy water must either flow from <font>Elizaeus</font> , or
else it hath but a base current; and could they not
fetch the authority of their Monasticke life from the
sample of Christ himselfe, they would repute it, as of
an vpstart family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I applaud their witte; this is not the worst
fetch to gaine esteeme. Were I a rich man it should
cost me an hundred pound twice told, but I would
haue <font>Saturne</font> or <font>Priamus</font> to stand on the top of my
line. I would not sticke to alter two or three letters
of my name, to make my selfe of kinne to
<font>Pantigruel</font> . Me thinks <font> <foreign>Moecenas atauis edite regibus</foreign> </font>   
is a
statly <font>Iambick</font> , it runnes so full in the mouth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The best iest (the liuely <font>Embleme</font> of his
malicious spirit) is this that hee playeth vpon the
<pagebreak id="21" />
letters which fall in order, without any choice, as
directs to the marginall notes. Hee had charged the
Knight with an <font>vnlearned Letter</font> : heereupon Sir
<font>Edward</font> , discouering diuers his <font>Solaecismes and
Incongruities</font> , (more then were named) to abridge the length
of his <font>Letter</font> did margent thus. <font> <foreign>Siegoindignus</foreign> </font> (which
word hee falsly cited) <font> <foreign>hac contumelia, tu indignus qui
faceres tamen</foreign> </font> . This falling vnder the letter, O,
<font>Rabshacheh</font> wittely tells him that, <font>that had reason to cry, O,
with which letter it was marked</font> . In like manner he
descants vpon the letter, <font>T</font> , by which hee vnderstands
<font>Throne</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas poore man, I beshrew my heart if I
do not pitty the penury of his barren conceit. He
was neere driuen, (God wot) when hee was faine to
ransacke the Wardrope of his witte, for such
thredbare shifts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What thinke you of this? when the Knight
tells him that <font>hee had a spight onely at one page, which
lies in the heart of his Letter</font> , hee in the quaintnesse of
his nimble Conceipt retorts it thus. <font>It lies in the
heart.</font> Was not here an <font>Eccho</font> farre fetch'd? When
the Knight sayes, <font>well flowne Buzzard</font> , he 
conceitedly answeres <font>I did not marke how neere a kinne that
soaring bird was to a Buzzard</font> . For <font>Miles gloriosus hath
beene long since hissed off the stage</font> , he returnes <font>you play
Miles gloriosus</font> : somewhat more Arte hee shewes in
putting <font>Cerberus</font> , for <font>Gelons dogge</font> ; for <font>a good mans
Dogge hath broken his legge ouer a lesse stile</font> , he altering
the person saith, <font>I feare your good dogge hath broken
his legge</font> . And as for the <font>Noddy</font> , the <font>Couentree Cappe</font> ,
<pagebreak id="22" />
and the <font>Tobacco pipe</font> , he bandies them vp and downe,
as if the <font>Tennis-court</font> would affoord him no other
balls. Thus doth he play <font>Tom Skull</font> , reuerberating
according to his Rhetoricall skill the same syllables
without any variety of inuention.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, It was well obserued. I now see <font>Nicks</font>
report was grounded vpon good warrant. <font>Ishmael</font>
is a perfect <font>Atomist</font> , there cannot a <font>Mote</font> passe his
fingers, <font>he notes the very number of the lines</font> . Sir <font>Edward</font>
cites a part of two <font>verses</font> out of a knowne <font>Poet</font> , onely
with alteration of one word, <font>vizt, -- <foreign>stulta est
clementia -- perituro parcere funi</foreign> </font> . Whereupon
<font>Rabshacheh</font> tells his reader, that the Knight makes a verse
that <font>exceedeth no lesse in fury then in feete</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He hath not onely a quarrell to my Masters
<font>Poetry</font> , but for want of better stuffe hee scannes his
<font>woods</font> also vpon his fingers, and findes them too
short by many feete. Yet I dare vndertake there are
<font>Oakes</font> enough left standing to beare a millon of as
stout Scar-crowes as <font>Rabshacheh</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That which galleth him is, that the Knight
now <font>possesseth the lands, which were formerly in the
tenure of Romish Catholiques</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now you speak of that, you put me in mind
of a merry answere which I heard my Master make
touching that point. The Woods (quoth hee)
standing vpon holy ground, he hath little reason to find
fault if I gaue them <font> <foreign>primam Tonsuram</foreign> </font> ; withall hee
concluded, that he was not a little glad he had
power so to order them; and the rather, for that such
<font>Dawes &amp; Puttocks</font> might be disappointed for building
their nests there.
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The felling of those Woods (as I haue
heard) will be the raising of a more charitable work:
But of what timber are those fellowes made, who
with their goggle eyes prye into euery mans priuate
affaires? Is this the next way to further <font>Purgatories
Triumph</font> ? but amongest other things, I muse how
<font>T. H.</font> scapes his fingers, seeing his reuolt first bredde
this quarrell; tis a wonder hee doth so quietly part
with his prey, <font>and tread so tenderly in that path, with
so kind a respect</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Assure your selfe there is a pad in the straw.
It is either for feare of some foule discouery, or for
hope of his recouery: hee finds it his best course, to
sooth him with the acknowledgement of a <font>learned
and pithy Treatise</font> , and to free him from the vices of
vulgar life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will not diue so deepe in his thoughts.
I warrant the Knight laughes his heart sore at the
<font>Black-moore</font> wench, which <font>Ishmaels</font> inuention hath
lately landed on our English coast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Laugh! I protest there comes not a friend
to visit him, but hee tells him of the <font>Negro</font> , &amp; how
friendly <font>Rabshakeh</font> hath promised to bring him to
the house where shee is to bee found: onely hee
feares shee is some cast wench; and if the Frier her
Ghostly Father, by whom she was conuerted, haue
blowne vpon her, hee hath passed his word to turne
her ouer to <font>Nick</font> Groome. And shall not I (thinke
you) be well promoted with the <font>Iaponians</font> reuersion?
But the best is he coniures them all <font>not to acquaint
the Ladies by any meanes, lest they suspect his neglect
<pagebreak id="24" />
of their attractiue beauties, whose smiles hee holdeth in
high esteeme</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Knight should make vse of
<font>Rabshacheh</font> his curtesie in this, he shall haue good cause to
confesse that there is a <font>Puragtory</font> indeed. When he
shall meet with <font>Plutoes Neece</font> vpon Earth, hee will
giue the more credite to those singing flames, and
ghastly Ghosts in the after World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue heard good <font>Philosophers</font> affirme, that
dreames most commonly arise, either <font> <foreign>Ex praeuia

had both faire daughters of <font>Negroes</font> or of
<font>Alexander</font> &amp; his <font>Aegyptian Cleopatra</font> , and so hauing a spleen
at the Knight, doth with a strong imagination fasten
the supposed crimes vpon him, as if hee had bin
<font>peccant</font> in that kind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Peccant</font> in that kind; I heard him say one day
in the Stable, hee would giue 20. pound <font>Rabshacheh</font>

London might read his booke: for then they would
hold him <font>fierce</font> , and craue no other testimony for the

praesidents. But all this while wee haue ouerslipped
his <font>positiue degree</font> . What saies he to the Knights
valour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In my opinion he might well haue giuen
ouer that chase, as hauing receiued a modest, short
sufficient, and discreet answere. Yet saith he, <font>your
letter gaue me iust cause to suspect your valour. For you
confesse that the horror of the gun-pouder plot doth liuely
represent before you, euen in your dreams, and imprint in
your most serious thoughts, that furious blast, which your
selfe, your poor self should haue sensibly felt. Had you
trembled at the bloudy massacres of many worthy Peeres, such a
fit might haue beseemed a Knight: Now the onely cause
of your feares and teares was the immoderate feeling of
<pagebreak id="27" />
your owne priuate danger; And what if your eies had bin
put out with that pouder, should the Common-wealth haue
lost any whit of her sight</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It were better the <font>Crowes</font> should picke out
the eies of tenne thousand such <font>Ishmaelites</font> , who are
not onely as so many <font>motes</font> , but huge <font>beames</font>
blemishing the sight of the body polliticke. Though he
think there is not such a <font>doting Iustice of peace again in
a country</font> , holding him no wiser then M=r=. <font>T. D. not so
politicke as the Statist deceased</font> , yet it is well knowne
his approued sufficiencies neede no such trumpet to
commend him in the gates.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You haue no reason to take it in ill part, hee
serues all Iustices of peace alike, glauncing at them as
<font>good for nothing but to wast paper and inke in friuolous
questions</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nicke</font> , passion hath almost drawne vs aside
from the first <font>Cauill</font> pretended against the <font>Knights
courage</font> , which was <font>the immoderate sense of his owne
priuate danger</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say well; he builds vpon that <font>Adage</font> ,
<font> <foreign>Degeneres animos timor arguit</foreign> </font> , which might bee easily
salued with that <font>authentique Maxime</font> , <font> <foreign>Charitas
incipit a seipso</foreign> </font> . It is an old saying and a true, <font> <foreign>Qui sibi
nequam, cui bonus</foreign> </font> ? Hee that is regardlesse of his owne
soule, life, and state, is no fit guardian for a 
Common-weale. But see how purblind this <font>eye-maker</font> is; when
he hath a purpose to play the counterfet. Hee that
was so quick-sighted to spye a marginall note ninty
two pages off to serue his owne turne, will not now
see that which is directly opposite, beeing directed
<pagebreak id="28" />
thereunto with the letter <font>K</font> , wherewith hee hath not
beene vnacquainted since hee could number <font>thrice
fiue yeares of his life</font> ; for had he but cast his eye (O
partiall eye) aside, hee might haue seene <font>Lucretius</font>
bedewing his cheekes with this lament, <font> <foreign>Vna dies dabit
exitio, multosque per annos Sustentata ruet moles et
machina regni</foreign> </font> . So that if the question be how it could
stand with the Knights valour to <font>imprint the horror of
that furious blast in his most serious thoughts</font> , he brings
in <font>Lucretius</font> epitomizing that, which himself thorow
the amazement of a so monstrous proiect was
vnable to particularize to the full: vizt. <font>that the glorious
fabrike of this auncient and famous Kingdome should haue
lyen flat on the ground</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Hinc illae lacrimae.</foreign> </font> This winde no doubt
raised the storme of the Knights passion, wherof that
the reader might entertaine more then a generall, or
cursory apprehension, he giues him an hint by
himselfe, and his owne friends, what euery true <font>Brittaine</font>
should haue either corporally or relatiuely felt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had he made an enumeration of the
worthy Peeres, whose massacre was murtherously
intended, then would he haue charged him (as I heare he
doth for his Apology in the behalfe of the most
renowmed, and euer memorable <font>Archbishop) with
base deuotion, fawning, flattering conceipts, foolish
fidling in their praises</font> , and what not? Or else you should
haue seene them all summed vp, with one and the
same regardlesse account, that had the powder put
out these <font>I. Is.</font> <font>the Common-wealth had not lost any
whit of her sight</font> .
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is very probable, howsoeuer he speake of
some of his owne profession who detest that bloudy
plot more, and for higher respects then the Knight,
yet it seems this Libeller is none of that number: for
albeit there was an impossibility that Sir <font>Edward</font>
should haue gone to the pot alone, without the
company of many noble Lords, and the rest his worthy
associates there assembled, he sticks not to say, <font>that
if that pouder had blowne him vp, the Common-wealth
should haue had no cause to bewaile her losse</font> . Thus doth
<font>Iabal Rachil</font> bewray his true intention in the
particular, which pollicy aduiseth him to colour
and conceale in the generall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Iabal Rachil</font> ! here is a new                   
<font>Hierogliphicke</font> ,
spick and spanne, from the mint: you haue on the
sodaine giuen him as fit a name as the best <font>Linguist</font>
could possibly haue inuented. These two wordes
do import as much as <font> <foreign>Fluuius Detractionis</foreign> </font> , <font>a Floud of
Slaunders</font> ; the first of which hath no neerer affinity
with his name, then the other with his nature, as
being <font> <foreign>rerum falsarum hamaxarius</foreign> </font> , so regardlesse of Kisse
and Kinne, that he will be easily drawne, according
to the Prouerb ( <font>with speed</font> ) to libell against his own
Father and neerest of bloud.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I am true Groome, I thought M=r=. Mayor
had called him <font>Rake-hell</font> , which hee might well haue
warranted; For whatsoeuer <font>Malice</font> could inuent,
<font>Sophistry</font> suggest, <font>Hypocrisie</font> pretend, or <font>Impudencie</font>
maintaine, his <font>crooked finger</font> hath raked together, out
of the bogs of Hell, to cramme this his railing
Pamphlet withall.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You haue not yet heard al he hath to say, for
the degrading of the Knights valour, who (saith <font>Iabal</font> )
<font>sheweth no small want of nobility and valour, in
desiring that the most superlatiue seuerity might bee
practised in the sharpest research of that viperous brood, those
merci-lesse hell-hounds, the Priests and Iesuites, whome
Mercy it selfe should bee thought cruell euer to
forgiue</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were hee not past all shame, hee would haue
swallowed downe that morsell with silence; The
more he rubs that sore, the more he renewes the
memory of that Tragicall ende of <font>Henry the fourth of
France</font> , whose princely breast carried to his graue the
Characters of their gracelesse, and vngrateful
disloyalty. Their murther of Kings, their garboyles
raised in free States, and their alienating the hearts of
subiects from their obliged obedience, must not in
any hand in them bee held treason, but deuotion;
wheras on the contrary it is not Courage, but
Cowardise, to seeke by the execution of penall lawes
(which are now grown rusty for want of vse) to free
the country from such <font>Wolues</font> , who make themselues
drunke with the bloud of the Saints, playing with
imperiall Globes, as Whales do with barrels, which
they tosse vp and downe at their pleasures.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet as if these things were nifles, no whit
preiudiciall to a Common-weale, he complaineth of
want of the Knights Charity, <font>Can any noble bloud</font>
(saith hee) <font>harbour in that heart, that is so greedy of
Innocent bloud? The Lion spareth his prostrate enemie,
whereas you long to teare out our hearts, in which you
<pagebreak id="31" />
cannot finde any sinne, besides an ouer-feruent desire to helpe
you to heauen</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An ouer-feruent desire indeede. <font> <foreign>Calescunt
plus satis.</foreign> </font> Rather then faile, if there be any powder in
a Country, they will send fiery Chariots to hoise vs
vp into the Clouds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It were better in my opinion to trauel
thither on foot; hee shall bee sure to lose much lether
who spurres Cut so fast: but by his leaue I will not
hyre such a blind Guide at so deere a rate. When I
come to S=t= <font>Omers</font> , <font>Doway</font> or <font>Rome</font> , he will beare mee
in hand, that I haue a little further to trauell, as
being in the Suburbs of Paradise, whereas (God wot)
I shall haue gone so farre out of my way, and then
stand in need of a new helpe, to bring mee out of the
Deuills mouth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wee shall heare anon what ghostly
directions hee will giue vs to further vs in this voyage: In
the meane season it is not amisse to obserue what
skill hee vseth in peruerting the Knights meaning.
The Knight indeed professeth irreconcilable
detestation; but of whom? <font>Of the Incendiaries of the
Romish forge.</font> Hee proclaimes not warre against <font>the
Inueagled Ladies</font> , and other poore seduced soules; his
discretion hath taught him not to bind the nocent
and innocent in one bundle. They are <font>Incendiaries</font>
whom hee brandeth as worthy perpetuall
detestation. <font> <foreign>Et quam diu tales</foreign> </font> , as long as they deserue   
that
denomination, I cannot see how the most <font>regular 
Charity</font> dare bid them <font>God speed</font> ; neither doth he
malitiously desire, but rather vpon more then probable
<pagebreak id="32" />
coniecture by way of caution foretell the
damnation of their soules who second those hellish Pyoners,
in those diuellish courses, which are so odious in the
sight of God and man. Reason he had to expresse his
dislike as <font>pathetically</font> as he could; for that hee feared
the like incouragements, and meritorious attributes,
to such future attempts from the Papall Sea, by
whose Agents that plot is now (in shew) disclaimed;
though rather for the contrary successe, then the
barbarous immanity thereof.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am verily perswaded that most Christian
Charity would not sticke to professe eternall 
opposition to that <font>viperous brood</font> , whose hearts harbour
dangerous factions, whose tongues are tip'd with
malitious scandalls, whose hands are imbrued in a 
Sea of innocent bloud. If the great <font>Iudge</font> haue shut
the gates of heauen against such inueterate, and
impenitent Murtherers, I cannot see how mercy can
be hired by the Popes <font>Indulgences</font> to lend them a key
for their entrance into life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Tempora mutantur.</foreign> </font> It was no cruelty of  
yore
to cast a poore harmlesse infant springing from the
scorched womb of the mother, into the fiery flames,
there to be consumed; but now the very speech of
<font>Parliament seuerity</font> against notorious traytours, and
matchlesse Malefactors, argues <font>want of Nobility and
Valour</font> : the truth is, our Iustices may be wel suspected
for both, as being according to <font>Iabals</font> account <font>taller
men of their tongues, then of their hands</font> . Did they
imploy their authority in suppressing them in their
particular Shires, as well as they vse their wits in
<pagebreak id="33" />
decreeing against them in the <font>Parliament house</font> , they
should gaine more honour, and the Countrey reape
farre more good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Quae supra nos nihil ad nos.</foreign> </font> I dare say  
you long
till you heare how he laies about him in the defence
of <font>Purgatory</font> , but his meaning is to try your patience.
The second part of his <font>Apology</font> touching certaine
exceptions against himselfe, taketh vp the
remainder of his first Chapter. For the dispatch of these
<font>toyes</font> (so hee tearmes them) as if hee were
challenging his Copes-mate at <font> <foreign>tria sequuntur tria</foreign> </font> , hee    
doth
methodically diuide this sequele into <font>Flies</font> , <font>Fies</font> and
<font>Lies</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The rime may well beseeme <font>Skelton</font>
the Poet, or <font>Elderton</font> the Ballad-maker; but
I would gladly see the reason; what meanes he by
<font>Flyes</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Edward</font> (I remember) to abate the pride
of his spurtling quill in blemishing the worth of
other mens lines, giues him a tast of such an <font>indecorum</font> ,
wouen throughout that work, as would inforce true
<font>Literature</font> to blush at the very first sight therof, there
being very few leaues wherein the Reader shall not
meet with a <font>Cobweb</font> , a <font>Spider</font> or a <font>Flye</font> . Some of which
he there paged to saue himselfe a labour in the
discouery of those many other <font>Solaecismes</font> , <font>Incongruities</font> ,
and <font>Iobbing Parentheses</font> , which any curious eye
without the helpe of Spectacles might easily discerne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what flappe hath he gotten to free his
paper from these magotting creatures, whose
blowing hath made his periods so vnsauory?
<pagebreak id="34" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He doth confesse, and auoid. He forsooth had
rather vtter his minde in a <font>crabbed then a new created
phrase</font> ; as being <font>more curious that his doctrine be true,
then his speech smooth</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hee that will take vpon him to Minorize
the learning of Authors, and to dedicate his workes
vnto persons of that extraordinary note, and
superlatiue iudgement, must not onely weigh his 
positions in the ballance of the sanctuary, that they bee
consonant to the truth, but <font>polish</font> them also with a
Rhetoricall <font>file</font> , that they want not those comely
<font>ornaments</font> which are requisite in the Professors of
<font>Art</font> . The fabricke of Theologicall worke ought to
bee raised <font> <foreign>ex lapidibus politis</foreign> </font> . Ragged and rugged
stones are fitter for the wild <font>Quarry</font> , then to stand in
the <font>beautifull gate</font> . To runne a poore silly heartlesse
<font>Metaphor</font> out of breath, argues little variety of wit
and lesse solidity of iudgement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you see <font>wit</font> play her prize? then listen
how pretily <font>Rachil</font> can defend <font>Solaecismes</font> . <font>Such
seeming faults</font> (saith he) <font>are by iudicious censures esteemed
not to be blemishes, but rather ornaments in the purest
Writers. The stile is childish which still feareth the rod,
not daring to depart one sillable from the rules of
Grammar. As in a Consort of sweet voices, a Discord now and
then doth make the Musicke more pleasing, so the
worthiest writers haue let some iobs passe in their workes, which
rather delight then offend a Iudicious Reader</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heere is a Ladde for the nonce to helpe a
lame dogge ouer a stile. O thou rarely patronized
<font>Barbarity</font> , downe on thy marrow-bones, prostrate
<pagebreak id="35" />
thy selfe at the foote of this thy valorous Champion
borne in <font>Brinitania</font> , who hath stretched his fiue wits
on the Tenter-hooks to maintaine thy worth. Tis
great pitty that this lusty <font>Iuuentus</font> came so raw from
the <font>ferula</font> ; had he continued a little longer at School
by this time he would haue made the <font>Welkin</font> roare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not how other men stand affected:
for my owne part, I haue euer held that Fidler
worthy to bee turned out of doores among the rascall
company, (though he haue a badge on his sleeue as
broad as my hand) who still harpes vpon one string,
and dwells vpon one tune, be it the best horne-pipe,
that euer <font>Lincoln-shire</font> affoorded. Doth not one harsh
bleating voice disgrace a whole quire? Doth not one
vnsauory hearb giue a relish to the whole pot of
pottage? A discord I grant may be admitted with some
grace, but not continued without some intollerable
disgust. In a word, if one flye mar a boxe of sweetest
ointment, I cannot see what credit this multiplicity
of <font>Spiders, Cobwebs, &amp; Flyes</font> can bring to <font>Iabals</font> booke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope we shall find better stuffe in the rest;
how doth he shake off the <font>flyes</font> ? they sticke I feare so
close to his skin, (maugre his <font>Neapolitan</font> perfume)
that they will hardly out of the bone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He blusters mainly that the Knight shold
crie, <font>Fie vpon his genericall and accidentall Christning of
Bells, relatiue honour of Images, and metaphoricall diuision
of the Kingdome betweene God and the Virgin</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is he so impudent as to stand in the defence
of these vncouth and ridiculous fopperies, which
can shew no other pedegree but <font>heathenish folly, and
<pagebreak id="36" />
Idolatrous superstition</font> to countenance them from
exploding contempt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As touching the first practise; he doth not
say that <font>Bells</font> are Christned; but that the <font>Blessing of
bells hath some genericall similitude with the Christning
of a Child</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether it be a similitude, or an <font>Identity</font>
I am not so cunning a Logician to distinguish. It skils
not much how they please to tearme it, who are
driuen to their shifts in seeking some colourable 
mantle to shroud it from the inglorious note of <font>heathenish
bastardy</font> . The question is, <font> <foreign>quo iure</foreign> </font> , what warrant he
hath for this genericall similitude, (which he
confesseth) betweene the <font>Blessing of Bells</font> , and the <font>Christning
of a Child</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay there he leaues you to your own search.
If you can neither find <font>Scripture, Father, nor ancient
Councell</font> to warrant this practise, hee meanes not to
be your Informer. It sufficeth him beeing betweene
Hawke and Buzzard to turne it ouer with a witlesse
and vnciuill iest, which he deuideth betweene his old
familiars the <font>Buzzard</font> and the <font>Asse</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue heard some say there was once much
adoe about the <font>shadow</font> of an <font>Asse</font> : but there beeing
store of that breed at <font>Doway</font> , <font>Iabal</font> is now growne so
nice, that he will not be seene vpon the backe of his
olde <font>animal</font> , wherefore the poore wearied <font>Asse</font> is
faine to ride him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis pitty they should part companies; yet
did I neuer see man more troubled with the <font>mare</font> in
his sleepe; then <font>Rachil</font> is at mid-day with the <font>Asse</font> ,
<pagebreak id="37" />
of whom he grones to be disburdened. Faine would
he haue the Printer beare part of his luggage; but
seeing it is now more then a yeere and a day since
the <font>Lazi-as</font> was found as a stray, and cryed in open
Mart by <font>Rabshakeh</font> , the custome of the Mannor
<font><foreign>secundum vsum Sarum</foreign> </font> makes it his owne, without
cutting off either mane or tayle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Min.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My masters I am glad to see your wits so
frolicke; yet I must needes say it is but <font> <foreign>Lex talionis</foreign> </font> :
besides, his reasoning approoues more then you say.
For admit a <font>Venetian Pander</font> , should put on the Popes
robes, his <font>Triple Crowne</font> , his <font>slipper</font> , come with S.
<font>Peters keyes</font> , sit downe in the <font>Conclaue</font> on the Chayre
appropriated to his Holinesse: and that he should in
his passage be saluted by the Vulgar as Pope
(bearing those ensignes with which that Deity alone is
dignified) Should he not be sure to be called <font>Coram</font> ,
and pay deare for this his genericall, and accidentall
resemblance? Will it serue his turne to say, Alas no
man heard mee say that I was <font>Paulus Quintus</font> , I did
but weare his vestiments, and a little counterfeit his
state.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nick.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will giue him my word hee shall finde it
better to play the <font>Deuill</font> , then so to immitate the
<font>Pope</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The case is of the same nature. The
blessing of Bells is no lesse presumptuously
accompanied with the sacred rites, and ceremonies of <font>Baptisme</font> ,
(yea with greater solemnities) then the Christning
of Children: so that the Laye people know not how
to distinguish them. Now marke how <font>Iabal</font> playes
<pagebreak id="38" />
the <font>Pandar</font> , he doth not say that <font>Bells</font> are Christned,
onely this, <font>The blessing of Bells hath some generall
resemblance with Christning</font> . Neither is the Venetian
<font>Pandar Pope</font> , though habited like the <font>Pope</font> : Shall he
not be sure to haue this pearle or the like rung in his
eares, by one <font>Antipho</font> or other. <font> <foreign>Quo pergis ganeo?
vnde emergis, vestitum hunc nactus? quid tibi quaeris?
Satin' sanus? quid sibi hic vestitus quaerit?</foreign> </font> I haue so
charitable an opinion of <font>Rachil</font> , that his reuerent
respect to the <font>Primate</font> of the Romish Sea, would make
him say, Fye vpon such a Pope. Yet (see how blind
deuotion ouer-swaies th'equity of his iudgement in
the like) hee quarrells with the Knight for saying,
<font>Fye vpon your genericall and accidentall Christening of
Bells</font> .
