 <head>ON <font>FRIDAY</font> THE 14TH OF <font>MAY</font> 1725, CAME ON THE TRYAL
OF <font>JONATHAN WILDE</font> , AT THE SESSIONS
HOUSE IN THE <font>OLD BAILY</font> , FOR THE CRIMES
UNDER-MENTION'D. <font>VIZ.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>He was indicted by the Name
of <font>Jonathan Wilde</font> , of the
Parish of S. <font>Andrew's Holborn</font> , for
privately stealing, in the Shop
of <font>Katharine Stetham</font> , 50 Yards of Lace,
Value 40 <font>l.</font> the Goods of the said <font>Katharine
Stetham</font> , on the 22d of <font>January</font> 1724-5.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He was a Second Time indicted, for that
whereas 50 Yards of Lace, Value 40 <font>l.</font>
was privately stolen in the Shop of
<font>Katharine Stetham</font> , by Persons unknown, on
the said 22d of <font>January</font> , he the said
<font>Jonathan Wilde</font> , on the 10th of <font>March</font>
following, did feloniously receive of the said
<font>Katharine Stetham</font> Ten Guineas, on
Account and under Colour of helping the
said <font>Katharine Stetham</font> to the said Lace
again; and did not then, nor any time
since, discover or apprehend, or cause to
be apprehended and brought to Justice,
the Persons that committed the said
Felony.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Prisoner, in the Morning before
his Tryal came on, dispersed about the
Court a considerable Number of printed
Lists of the Felons that he had 
apprehended, which concluded in these Words;
<font>In regard therefore of the Numbers above
Convicted, some that have yet escaped
Justice are endeavouring to take away the Life
of the said</font> Jonathan Wilde. This
extraordinary Proceeding gave Occasion to the
King's Counsel to observe, That such
Practices were unwarrantable, and not to
be suffer'd in any Court of Justice: That
this was apparently intended to take off
the Credit of the King's Witnesses, and to
prepossess and influence the Jury. But as
he believed them to be Men of Integrity,
he was under no Apprehensions that it
would have such an Effect: Nor, on the
contrary, could he suppose that they would
give any other than a conscientious
Verdict, according to Evidence, tho' the
indirect Management of the Prisoner was far
from making his Cause appear favourable:
That it was impossible that a Man that
had carry'd on a Trade of Felony for so
many Years past; a Man that had bred up
<pagebreak id="3C2" />
and erected a Corporation of Felons; a
Man, whose constant known Practice had
been to procure Goods that have been
lost in any Part of the Town; that it
was impossible that such a Man should
not have it in his Power to detect those
Felons: And yet there was good Reason
to believe, that (to the great Scandal of
publick Justice) he had on the contrary
terrify'd many from Reformation, and
prevented them from making such
Discoveries as might have been of publick
Advantage: That if a strict Enquiry was to
be made into the Motives of his
apprehending those Criminals named in his List,
we should find that they were private
Interest, old Grudges, or fresh Quarrels, and
not the least Regard to Justice and his
Country, <font>&amp;c</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Prisoner pray'd that the Witnesses
against him might be examin'd apart;
which the Court granted.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Henry Kelly</font> (being sworn) deposed thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
In <font>January</font> last I went to see Mrs.
<font>Johnston</font> , who then lived at the Prisoner's
House: Her Husband brought me over
from <font>Ireland</font> ; upon which Account I
wanted to speak with her. I found her at
home, and we drank a Quartern of
<font>Holland's</font> Gin together. By and by in comes
Mrs. <font>Murphy</font> with a Pair of Brocaded
Shoes and Clogs, and makes a Present of
them to Mrs. <font>Wilde</font> . The Prisoner was
in Company. We drank two or three
Quarterns more, and then I and Mrs.
<font>Murphy</font> got up to go away together. The
Prisoner ask'd me which way I was
going? I told him to my Lodgings at the
<font>Seven Dials. I suppose you go</font> Holborn <font>Way</font> ,
says he. We answer'd, <font>Yes</font> . <font>Why then</font> ,
says he, <font>I'll tell ye what; -- There's an
old Blind Bitch that sells fine</font> Flanders <font>Lace
just by</font> Holborn-Bridge; <font>her Daughter is as
blind as herself; and if ye call there, you may</font>
speak <font>with a Box of Lace</font> (that is, <font>steal a</font> 
Box.) -- <font>I'll go along with ye, and shew
ye the Door.</font>  So the Prisoner and I and
<font>Murphy</font> went together, till we came
within Sight of the Door: He pointed and
<pagebreak id="4C1" />
shew'd us which it was, and said he would
wait for us, and bring us off, if any
Disturbance should happen. <font>Murphy</font> and I
went in, and turn'd over a great deal of
Lace, but could see none that would please
us, not a Piece that was broad enough,
and fine enough; for it was our Business
to be very nice and difficult. At last, the
old Woman stept up Stairs to fetch
another Piece: And as People of our
Profession are seldom guilty of losing an
Opportunity, I made use of this. I took a
Tin Box of Lace, gave it to Mrs. <font>Murphy</font> ,
and she hid it under her Cloak. The old
Woman came down with another Box,
and shew'd us several Pieces, for which
she asked 6 <font>s.</font> a Yard. We offer'd her 4 <font>s.</font>
and not being likely to agree about the
Price, we came away, and found the
Prisoner waiting where we left him. We
told him what Success we had had, and
so went back with him to his House.
There we open'd the Box, and found
Eleven Pieces in it. He ask'd us if we
would have ready Money, or stay till an
Advertisement came out. Stock being
pretty low with us at that time, we chose the
first, and so he gave us three Guineas and
four Broad Pieces. I took for my Share
three Guineas and a Crown, and Mrs.
<font>Murphy</font> had the rest. <font>I can't afford to give you
any more</font> , (says he) <font>for though I have got
some Influence over her, by helping her to
Goods two or three times before, yet I know
her to be a stingey hard-mouth'd old Bitch,
and I shan't get above Ten Guineas out of
her</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Margaret Murphy</font> deposed the same;
and <font>Katharine Stetham</font> corroborated that
Part of their Depositions which related to
their being in her Shop; and added, that
she miss'd the Lace in about half an Hour
after they were gone. The Evidence was
full and positive against the Prisoner.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>But here his Counsel (who waited in
readiness if any Point of Law should arise)
stood up, and beg'd Leave to declare it
as their Opinion, that the Defendant,
according to the Evidence given against him,
could not be guilty of the Indictment;
and their Reason for it was, that the
Indictment sets forth, That HE did
privately steal this Lace (IN) the Shop; when it
was certain that he did not enter the Shop:
That he might indeed be guilty of a simple
Felony, in being Accessory before the Fact,
or in Receiving the Goods after; but
could not be guilty of the Capital
Offence, except (according to the Act) it had
been inserted in the Indictment, that He
did <font>Assist, Hire</font> or <font>Command</font> . The Court,
in summing up the Evidence, observed to
the Jury, that in Felonies, Burglaries, and
Robberies on the Highway, every 
<pagebreak id="4C2" />
Accessory before the Fact is a Principal; he that
stands by, or watches at a Distance,
being as guilty, and as liable to the same
Punishment, as the very Man that enters
the House, or steals the Money or Goods.
But as it was not remembred that there
had yet been any Precedent, of the like
Construction being put upon Indictments
of this Nature, it remained as a Matter of
Doubt; and therefore, in such Cases, it
was most eligible to incline to the Side of
Mercy.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>The Second Indictment against <font>Jonathan
Wilde</font> was upon the following Clause in
an Act passed in the 4th Year of the Reign
of his Majesty King <font>George</font> I. which was
read in Court, <font>viz.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
<comment type="compiler">THE READING OF THE CLAUSE OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Katharine Stetham</font> (being sworn)
deposed thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue> On the 22d of <font>January</font> ,
between Three and Four in the Afternoon,
a Man and a Woman came into my Shop,
under Pretence of buying some Lace:
They were so very difficult, that I had none
below that would please them; and so,
leaving my Daughter in the Shop, I stept
up Stairs, and brought down another Box.
We could not agree about the Price, and
so they went away together; and in about
half an Hour after I miss'd a Tin Box
of Lace, that I valu'd at 50 <font>l.</font> The same
Night, and the next, I went to <font>Jonathan
Wilde's</font> House; but not meeting with him,
I advertised the Lace that I had lost, with
<pagebreak id="5C1" />
a Reward of 15 Guineas, and no Questions
ask'd. But hearing nothing of it, I went
to <font>Jonathan's</font> House again, and then met
with him: He desired me to give him a
Description of the Persons that I suspected,
which I did as near as I could; and then
he told me that he'd make Enquiry, and
bid me call again in two or three days.
I did so; and then he said, that he had
heard something of my Lace, and
expected to know more of the Matter in a
little Time. I came to him again on the
Day that he was apprehended, (I think
'twas the Fifteenth of <font>February</font> .) I told
him, that though I had advertised but
Fifteen Guineas Reward, yet I wou'd give
Twenty or Twenty-five rather than not
have my Goods. <font>Don't be in such a
Hurry</font> , says he; <font>I don't know but I may help
you to it for less; and if I can, I will.
The Persons that have it, are gone out of
Town; I shall set them to quarrelling about
it, and then I shall get it the cheaper</font> .  On
the Tenth of <font>March</font> , he sent me Word,
that if I would come to him in <font>Newgate</font> ,
and bring Ten Guineas in my Pocket, he
could help me to my Lace. I went: He
desired me to call a Porter; but I not
knowing where to find one, he sent a
Person who brought one that appeared to
be a Ticket Porter. The Prisoner gave
me a Letter, which he said was sent him
as a Direction where to go for the Lace;
but I could not read, and so I deliver'd
it to the Porter. Then he desired me to
give the Porter Ten Guineas, or else (he
said) the Persons that had the Lace would
not deliver it. I gave the Porter the
Money; he went away, and in a little Time
return'd, and brought me a Box that was
seal'd up, but not the same that was lost.
I open'd it, and found all my Lace but
one Piece. <font>Now, Mr.</font> Wilde, (says I) 
<font>what must you have for your Trouble? Not
a Farthing</font> , says he; <font>not a Farthing for
me. I don't do these things for Worldly
Interest, but only for the Good of the poor
People that have met with Misfortunes. As
for the Piece of Lace that is missing, I hope
to get it for you e'er be long; and I don't
know but that I may help you not only to
your Money again, but to the Thief too; and
if I can, much good may't do you. And as
you're a good Woman and a Widow, and a
Christian, I desire nothing of you but your
Prayers, and for them I shall be thankful. I
have a great many Enemies, and God knows
what may be the Consequence of this
Imprisonment</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Prisoner said nothing in his
Defence, but that he had convicted a great
Number of Criminals; only he desired
<pagebreak id="5C2" />
that <font>Murphy</font> and <font>Kelly</font> might be called
in again, which was granted. Then (this
Indictment being laid for helping
<font>Katharine Stretham</font> to Goods that had been
stolen from her by Persons UNKNOWN)
he pray'd, that <font>Murphy</font> might be ask'd
who stole the Lace? In Expectation, that
she would unwarily swear, that herself
and <font>Kelly</font> were the Persons; (for though
such Evidence was given in the former
Tryal, the Law could take no Notice
of it in this, except it had been sworn
over again.) But the Court inform'd
him, that as <font>Murphy</font> was an Evidence
upon Oath, no body could require her
to answer any Questions to accuse
herself. Then he pray'd the Court would
ask her, if he (the Prisoner) stole the
Lace? To which she answer'd, <font>No; but
he was concerned with those that did
steal it, and he received it after it was
stolen</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>From hence the Counsel for the
Prisoner beg'd Leave to observe, That as
<font>Murphy</font> had sworn that the Prisoner was
guilty of Felony, they presumed that the
Act upon which he was now indicted,
was never intended to affect him, or
any other Felon, but only such Persons
that were not Felons themselves, but hold
a Correspondence with Felons. For as
there were old Laws in Force for the
Punishment of Felons, it would have been
altogether unnecessary that a new Law
should be made to the same Purpose, --
that is, to no Purpose at all. -- That
the very Preamble to that Clause of the
Act upon which the Prisoner was
indicted, intimates, by a plain Distinction, that
Felons are not in that Place intended.
The Words are thus: &quot;Whereas there
are several <font>Persons</font> who have secret
Acquaintance with <font>Felons</font> , and who
make it their Business to help Persons
to their stolen Goods, and by that
means gain Money from them, which
is divided between THEM and the
FELONS.&quot; -- That by a Proviso
in the said Clause, it could not be
supposed that Felons were there intended,
without making Contradictions and
Inconsistencies in the Act itself. For the
Words are, &quot;Unless such Person doth
apprehend, or cause to be
apprehended, such Felon who stole the same,
and cause such Felon to be brought to a
Tryal for the same, and give Evidence
against him.&quot;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Suppose now, that there
was but one Person concern'd in such a
Case; can it be thought that ever the
Legislature intended that this Person
should apprehend himself, bring himself
<pagebreak id="6C1" />
to Tryal, give Evidence against himself,
convict himself, and hang himself? No,
certainly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>To this the Counsel for the Crown
reply'd to the following Effect, That it
was no Absurdity or Contradiction to
say, that that Act was intended to
affect Felons, even in a Case where there
was but one Felon concern'd: For that
a Man's being a Felon, did not any way
hinder him from discovering his
Accomplices, if he had any; and if he had
none, but committed the Offence by
himself, it would be impossible to try him for
taking Money upon Account of restoring
Goods that were stolen, till he was first
convicted of stealing those Goods: And
this first Conviction would then be
sufficient. There would be no Necessity for
trying him for the other Offence; for
if he was found guilty, it would make
no Alteration in his Punishment: But
that this was not the Case of the
Prisoner: That it was evident that he had
Accomplices, and had not discover'd them.
The Court farther observ'd, that Felons
were so far from being excepted in that
Act, that it was principally intended
against then; for it particularly
mentions, &quot;Those that make it their
Business to help People to stolen Goods.&quot;
And it was certain, that such Persons
<pagebreak id="6C2" />
must be Receivers of stolen Goods,
knowing them to be stolen, and such are
Felons. That the Case of the Prisoner came
within almost every Circumstance of the
Act; it being evident that he was a
Person that had secret Acquaintance with
Felons, who made it his Business to help
People to stolen Goods, and by that
means gain'd Money from them; which
was divided betwixt him and the Felons, 
and thereby greatly encouraged such
Offenders, and had not apprehended them.
That it was a very surprizing Plea for a
Man to say, I am more guilty than you
are aware of, and therefore I ought to
suffer less: And that it could not be
thought that the Parliament ever intended
by this Act to excuse a Man meerly
because he was a Felon, and more Criminal
than another.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Jury acquitted the Prisoner of the
first Indictment, and found him Guilty of
the other.</nonSpeech>
