</dialogue> <head>A DIALOGUE BETWIXT A
GENTLEMAN AND A 
GENTLEWOMAN, WHETHER THE WIFE 
LOVES HER HUSBAND MORE 
THEN THE HUSBAND HIS WIFE.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Gent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, are you
invited to Mr.
such a ones Wedding.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, he did me that
honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am very glad of it, 
Madam, we shall have the honour of
your conversation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It shall be I that shall
receive the honour of yours,
whereof I make great account.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I know that the
honour you do me in loving my
company is not a new thing,
therein it is that I place all my
happiness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet, Sir, I do not observe
that my approbation can be much
advantagious to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know by experience, that
all those that are in your esteem,
are reputed persons of honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have as much
civility as Mr. <font>C.</font> hath love for his
Mistris.
<pagebreak id="201" /> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I could wish it were so,
Madam: for I know he loves her
passionately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All mens love is such, they
are all fire and flame when they
are a wooing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, Madam, a man of
parts that hath made chose of a 
Gentlewoman of merit and of
good education, ought to have as
much love for her, as she hath
good qualities.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say nothing to the
contrary: but they should also
continue the same after their mariage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Questionless, Madam, 
every man of honour doth so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All men are generally
guilty of inconstancy in this
point.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I grant you that men love
generally less that which is 
purchased: but you accuse men of a
crime whereof women are guilty
as well as men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir, do not say
so, a woman hath alwaies more
love for her husband, then her
husband hath for her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it Madam, but
she hath less amity, because her
imagination is stronger, and her
apprehension less perfect.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What so great difference
do you think there is between
amity and love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G</nonSpeech><dialogue> Love and amity do differ,
in that love is a passion, and
<pagebreak id="202" />
amity is a virtue which doth
consist in acquaintance.
Therefore the passion of love is to be
excused in young people: but it 
is ridiculous in old men, in whom
amity is commendable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> However I can prove it
to you by several examples, that
women love more then men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you not grant me,
Madam, that those which have
more knowledg, are more capable
of a solid amity?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you gather from
thence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I conclude, that men love
more, having more knowledg
and learning then women, and
more light of their lives and
behaviours, then they have of
their husbands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Examples being stronger
then reasons, I can prove you my
words that way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will hear you, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You know that from all
times, women have been
contented with a single husband, to
keep their whole affection unto
him. But in time past, as now
with the Turks, a man having
many wives, it followeth, that
the more their affection is
common, the less strong it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> We are not in dispute
<pagebreak id="203" />
of the time past, nor of the Turks
custome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, but if it was the
custome among Christians, every
man would have more then one
wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is not a sufficient
proof of that which you affirm,
because a man may have as much
affection for many, as for a
single one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I agree to that but it doth
not follow, that he should do so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will prove it you my self
by the effects, seeing that you
will not believe my reasons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall be very glad to
hear what examples you can
bring of men mens affection
towards their wives.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Can there be a greater love
then that of <font>Tyberius Graccus</font> ,
who choosed to die, that
<font>Cornelie</font> his wife might live, having
killed the male of the two
Serpents which he found in his
Chamber: because the Oracle
had assured him, that if he should
kill the female, he would expose
the life of his dear half to the
rigour of death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can a love be like unto
that of <font>Artemisia</font> Queen of
<font>Caria</font> , who after her husbands death
swallowed down his ashes, being
willing to be his grave, and joyn
her self unto him.
<pagebreak id="204" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But, Madam, can a cruelty
be greater then that of
<font>Semiramis</font> , who having had the Power
but one day in her hands, caused
her husband <font>Ninus</font> to be
murdered, who had been so far
indulgent unto her, and that had
loved and cherished her so much all
his life time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is a particular
example of a wicked woman: but
how many Emperours and Kings
have been known, that have put
their wives to death, to marry
others?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us break off, Madam,
undoubtedly you have a great
affection for your husband. If
I did not fear of being guilty, I
would envy his happiness: but
I will content my self in
wishing for a wife who deserts might
equal yours, if it be possible to
find such another again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You jear me, Sir, I wish
you one worthy of your
merits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I am a thousand
times obliged to you for your
good wishes.
<pagebreak id="205" />
</dialogue> <head>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A 
FRENCH GENTLEMAN, AND 
AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Gent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I come to
have the honour
to render you my respects.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Madam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you know that
you are very welcome, and that I
receive an unspeakable honour in
your visits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, the knowledg
that I have of your generosity,
doth not permit me to doubt of
my welcome: but for the rest I
must contredict you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, Sir, I have heard
you say formerly, that you would
never contredict Ladies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G</nonSpeech><dialogue> I grant it, Madam, but it
is when they do not laugh at
me. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you find that I jear
you, Sir? do you think that I
am so incivil?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I believe that
you are the most civil Lady in
the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then do you
reprehend me of a crime, by accusing
me of jesting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not believe it to be a
crime, and without doubt, 
Madam, you do not repute it such.
<pagebreak id="206" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, Sir, I do not hold
it to be a great crime amongst
friends: but if a body use it
very often, I should blame
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I would do the same,
Madam, but confess that you jear
when you tell me that you receive
an unspeakable honour by my
visits: for I rather believe, that
I put too much trouble upon
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw a man like
you, you would be the only civil
person: you name civility a
jearing in every body else but
you.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I crave your pardon,
Madam, it is not a jearing when
you use it towards them that
deserve it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, the French
Gentlemen are pleased to cross the
Ladies: but let us talk no more
of it, do me the favour to take a
seat, and to tell me some
news.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I know not any
that may be worthy relating to
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing
that is unworthy the relating?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To speak in earnest, 
Madam, every thing is unworthy of
you, and if men would take heed
of this, they would never be able
to say any thing to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, oblige me so much
as to speak freely with me, and
<pagebreak id="207" />
and without complement: for I
asseure you that I have no skill
that way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks, Madam, I
perceive no complements in my
discourses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> They are full of them, Sir,
in fine will you inform me of 
nothing to day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I'le tell you that
there will be gallant company in
the Park this evening.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What Company?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION MISSING IN THE ENGLISH TEXT.</comment>    
Master such a one wil be there
with his Mistris, will you be
pleased to be there, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, I do not care
to be where there is so much
company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, if you please to
go thither, I shall have the
honour to wait upon you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not to day, Sir, I give
you thanks for your civility.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You love nothing but
solitariness, Madam, that you may
entertain your self with the
objects of your love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet I am not in love, 
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe you are, 
Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You surprise me very
much, Sir, to make me believe
that <font>I</font> am in love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Be not offended at it,
Madam, but asseuredly you are
so, I read it in your eyes.
<pagebreak id="208" />
   I wonder very much at what
you say, and I do not apprehend
it: therefore I intreat you to
explain your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will obey you, Madam:
is it not true that there are
several sorts of love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How many <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: my</comment> sorts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I believe you
know that as well as I: for I
am certain that you are ignorant
of nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Excuse me, Sir, you shall
oblige me in instructing me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, it is not to
instruct you: for asseuredly you do
not doubt that we have only one
love, but that it hath several
objects.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You will make me a
Philosopher, Sir: but how many
objects hath it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Many, Madam: but
chiefly these three, God, Man, and
brutish Creatures.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What love do you think
I am possessed with?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> With all, Madam: for
I am sure you love God well,
and consequently all vertues,
and your neighbours
likewise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are very obliging,
Sir, to have so good opinion of
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I should be to blame, if I
had an ill opinion of you.
<pagebreak id="209" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But you, Sir, you have
some particular Mistris which
you love better then your
ordinary friends.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be so, Madam, I
should not be a man, if I should
not love the finest thing in the
world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In your opinion, Sir,
your Mistris is the handsomest
in the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not say so, Madam,
although she that I most honour
is extreamly well furnished with
good qualities.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I find you very
happy to have a Mistris so well
accomplished, I pray God give you
good success in your love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I give you many
thanks with all my heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, shall I not have the
honour to know the name of her
that hath the glory to captivate
you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech you, Madam,
hold me excused in naming of
her, until she knows it her
self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How, Sir, is she ignorant
of your affection?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Madam, because I
durst not as yet give her notice
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who hindered you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, it is for fear
that she should not love me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Fear is a passion that so
<pagebreak id="210" />
generous a heart as yours is,
ought not to be possessed with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, it is a hard
matter to be very much in love
without having some of every
passion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought, Sir, that fear
was onely the passion of a 
cowardly man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> True, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet I see it not alwaies
true.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is so in one sense: for
it is the fear of death that takes
away courage, and that makes
Cowards run away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I find that that fear is
very necessary for to preserve
ones life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is very true: but it is
much contrary to a State. For
if all the subjects of a King were
possessed with it, he would have
but few soldiers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is true: but if a soldier
did not fear correction, he would
be very insolent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are in the right,
Madam, it is the use that is made of
it, that makes it profitable or
dangerous in all manner of waies
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> None can be righteous
without the fear of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Wise man saith, that
it is the beginning of wisdom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It seems to me that
Lovers live alwaies in more fear
then hope: which proves true in
you.
<pagebreak id="211" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le tell you, Madam, that
love is alwaies mingled with
hope and fear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hope hath made more
men unfortunate, then fear ever
made unhappy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is true that hope is very 
deceitful.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> After having hoped a
long while, one doth despair.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a prudence to forsake
hope, when one cannot attain
unto his end.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> One must have a great
wit, and know well how to use it
right, and withal one must be
very discreet to govern himself
in all manner of occurrences.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You possesse all these
qualities in the highest degree.
Therefore you are esteemed the
wonder of your age.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, do not flatter me, I
pray you; I know my self well
enough to know what I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not question it,
Madam, it is that which makes you
unequal: for it is the highest
degree of wisdom to know ones
self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, Sir, there is a great
deal of satisfaction in your
conversation, do me the honour to
let me see you oftner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall not fail to come
and render you my service, as
well to obey you, as for the
extream pleasure that I take in
<pagebreak id="212" />
your company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I can asseure you, Sir, that
you shall alwaies be very
welcome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>G.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I give you a
thousand thanks for your favors,
and shall be all my life time
your most affectionate servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I am your most
humble servant.

never been there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what do you intend
to do at Greenwich?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is a fine question, &amp;
what should we do elswhere?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us go thither if you

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us rather take a
Coach.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, there is more
pleasure by water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Gentleman saith
right, we may smoke in the boat,
and drink a merry cup.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my part, you know I

drink a cup of good Canary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall we not drink and
smoak enough when we come
thither?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, if we will go

whilst the Tide serves.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on, I'le overtake you

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We should have told him

he is never without it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, let us agree for

Greenwich, and to bring us back

   Sir, you shal give vs a Crown 
if you please.
   It is too much, you shall have
four Shillings.
   We cannot carry you for
less.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must give them five
Shillings, they are honest men,
they must get their living.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, you shall have what
you ask.
   Where is your Boat?

the respect that is due to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, Sir, you laugh at
me, we will stay here then till
to morrow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess, 
Gentlemen, you are very ceremonious.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, come, Gentlemen,
let us make haste, what needs so
many ceremonies among friends.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech you, Sir, let us
not make these Gentlemen stay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I had rather commit
an incivility, then to disobey
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seriously, Gentlemen, 
this is a fine River.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is the finest in the
world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The water is very calm at
present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We could not have pitcht
upon a finer day to go by
water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But Mr. <font>A.</font> you have brought
Tobacco and Pipes with you: but
where will you have fire?
<pagebreak id="216" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, I have forgot a
match, I am giddy-headed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So much the better, for
indeed I do not love smoaking,
but when I am at my journies end
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really, Gentlemen, our
conversation is better then
smoak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are very near the
Bridg, is there no danger to shoot
it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No more then in this
place, the water is smooth now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I go through it two or
three times a day, whether the
water be high or low.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are mighty bold, I
went through it once when the
water was low, the boat had like
to have been sunk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is not too much
safety, I will not trust too much
to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor I neither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, Gentlemen, cannot
you swim?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I swim like a fish, but
not in my cloaths.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have swimmed many
times over the River with a
Boat after me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le lay a wager, that I
can swim from hence to
Greenwich.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray let us have that
passtime a little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe he would drink
water whilst we drink wine.
<pagebreak id="217" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some other time,
Gentlemen, the water is not hot enough 
now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish I could swim on
purpose to bathe my self now:
but I swim like a stone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are now under Bridg.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a fine Bridg.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is the finest in
Europe.   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long is it since it
was built, it is above --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are now going to see
a great many ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall see many of them:
but they are almost all Merchant
men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where are then the Men 
of War?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are most of them 
now at Sea
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little before the War
was proclaimed, I went to
<font>Rochester</font> by water with some
Gentlemen of <font>London</font> , we saw the
finest of the Kings ships in the
River of <font>Rochester</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see the
Soveraign?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and twenty more of
the biggest next it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They say it is a prodigious
ship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is the biggest that
ever I saw, you would think
that you are in a Castle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks that those are
very great ships.
<pagebreak id="218" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are big enough for
Merchant Men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is there no Men of War
upon the Thames at this time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There may be some, I
suppose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard his Majesty
hath caused many Fregats to be
built at <font>Wooledg</font> &amp; at <font>Deptford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw them begun.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is there no way to go see
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if we have but time
enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will come on purpose
another time, to see the ships.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we have time, we may
land at <font>Deptford</font> as we come
back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As the company shal think
fitting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall see, we shall 
see.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are almost at
<font>Greenwich</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish we were there
already: for I begin to be dry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the business in hand,
we do not mind our bottles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, pull your Cup out of
your pocket.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, you have done well
to put me in mind: for I did not
think upon it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, Gentlemen, to your 
health.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tope it.
<pagebreak id="219" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Drink to me, for I am
almost choakt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To me, Sir, I will pledg
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I drink the Kings
health.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I accept of it with all my
heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It must go round.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, it is his Majesties
good health, I drink it to you,
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not drink it up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot, Sir, the glass is
too big, and you have filled it so
full, that I cannot hold it
without spilling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, I drunk it so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Excuse me, I cannot drink
so much at a draught.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Gentleman is very
sober.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, Sir, pledg me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire no better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have drunk but one cup,
make haste then, that I may
drink at my turn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me see the cup, Sir, I
will help you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will help my self, give
me the bottle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, here it is, it is
almost empty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is enough still for
me.
<pagebreak id="220" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He draws pretty well for a 
little man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, let us open the
other bottle, I am so dry, that I
could drink the Sea and fishes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You spill, have a care what
you do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You cannot make so much
as you have lost.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am to blame, I confess:
but seeing I have committed a
fault, I must drink it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This wine will make a 
Cat speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, let us empty
our bottle, before we come out of
the Boat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give a glass to these poor
Watermen, that have taken so
much pains to row
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, friends, this is for
you.
   Thanks, Gentlemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, shall we pay
for Boat now, or shall we pay
them when we come back?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do as you please, as you
think good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, we will pay when
we come back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a very fine and
delightful place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, will you have
me carry you to that honest mans
house I spoke to you of, when we
came away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath he got good wine?
<pagebreak id="221" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He hath some excellent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us go there then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Besides, he is a man of
good company too.
   He hath been in <font>France</font> , he
can speak good French.
   He is altogether merry, he 
doth alwaies sing.
   He hath many drinking songs
   He will make you burst with 
laughing.
   One is never weary of his
company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us go there quickly
then, he is such a man as I would
have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your servant, Landlord.
   Sir, your most humble
servant.
   How do you do?
   Well at your service.
   We are come to take a little
divertisement here these 
Gentlemen and I.
   I have commended to them
both your self, &amp; your good wine
   Sir, I am much obliged to you, 
I give you thanks for it.
   Gentlemen, you are all very
welcome.
   Will you be pleased to walk up
staires, I have some ho-go that
I wil send you up, with some of
the best wine, of a high colour, it
is like me?
   For although I am not 
high-minded, I love to drink high,
chiefly about the higher time of
<pagebreak id="222" />
the day (the evening) and yet I
never stumble, nor am never
more impertinent nor insolent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, Landlord, you
speak very good French.
   Excuse me, Sir, I understand
it more then I do high
German.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Gentlemen, did not
I tell you, that this man was very
good company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly he is very merry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is a good Fellow, I
must scrape acquaintance with
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will delight in his 
company when you know him.
   Gentlemen, I bring you
somthing that was never eaten yet.
   Do you see this 
Neats-tongue?
   You never saw it before.
   Though it were for the Kings
mouth, it could not be better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, Landlord, we are
ingaged to you, come, sit down
here by me.
   I love you, you are of a good
humour, I am going to drink
your health.
   Will you do me reason.
   Yes indeed, Sir, I do reason
to all the world.
<pagebreak id="223" />
   And especially unto honest
people.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Landlord, you and I must
be better acquainted.
   Faith, Sir, if you get
acquaintance with me, you will do
well: for I love greatness. And
though I am no great man, I do
as my Granfather did, I rise
betimes in the morning, before it
be broad-day, and I drink a
great glass of wine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do as an honest man
ought to do.
   Alas, Sir, I did it formerly:
but now I am not able to do it
any longer, I am like my old
cloaths, I have had my time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Landlord, here's to you.
   Sir, I thank you.
   I have heard that you have a 
great many good songs, pray
sing us one.
   Yes, Sir: but pray cut this
Neats tongue, I asseure you that
it is an exceeding good one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lend me a knife,
Landlord, and I will cut it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, it looks well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is exceeding good.
   Gentlemen, did not I tell you
so, another time you will believe
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We did not doubt but it
that it was good upon your word.
<pagebreak id="224" />
   Gentlemen, one word draws
another, tast a little of this white
wine, I believe you will like
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will pledg you,
Landlord, it is in a good hand, well, 
Sir, it is the health of your
inclinations.
   Sir, I drink it to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I receive it with all my
heart, I will pledg you
presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Landlord, I find this
tongue a little too salted, have
you got nothing else for me? For
I love not things that are so
salted.
   I have a couple of good
Pullets below on the spit.
   Well, bring them up to us, if
you please.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, ah, you have then a 
mind to feast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>H.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Gentleman is of my
humour, he is not dainty-mouth'd
but he loves good victuals well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our Landlord saith right:
but I'le tell you more when my
belly is full, I want but few
things to satisfie my hunger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I blow this cup from
you, you preach too long over the
vintage.
   Well, well, like for like.
   But, Gentlemen, you do not
mind that it begins to be late.
<pagebreak id="225" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do not trouble your self,
we shall have time enough.
   Gentlemen, here are the two
Pullets, they are tender as --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sit you down there,
Landlord, and eat a bit with us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, I will tell
you one thing, I eat not much:
but I make it up in drink.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must do so, little
eating, much drinking.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I act my part well enough:
for I do really believe, that as
long as I drink, I shall never
die.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>D.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say right, but
otherwise when you are dead, you shall
drink no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas, what misfortune,
when I think upon it; come, let
us drink then while we live.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Drawer, go and draw us
of the same white wine.
   I will, Sir.
   Make haste.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, Landlord, sing a
fudling song.
   I will, Sir: but I must first
drink a glass.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Drawer is long a 
coming.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L.</nonSpeech><dialogue> He would be fit to fetch 
death.
   Why dost thou make us stay
so long?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, Landlord, this is
to your health, and to thank you
<pagebreak id="226" />
for your good company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I am your most
humble servant.
   I am to give you thanks for
the honour you have been pleased 
to bestow upon me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do we owe you,
Landlord?
   Gentlemen, there is eight
Shillings for Wine, pay what
you please for the rest.
   Here, Landlord, there is
fifteen Shillings for all, are you
content?
   Yes, Sir, and give you many
thanks besides.
   Farewel, Landlord, till we
see you again.
   Gentlemen, your most humble
servant, I hope you will do me
the favour to come and see me
when you come to divertise your
selves in these parts.
   Yes, yes, we will.
   You shall alwaies command
the best Wine.
   We thank you, Landlord.
   Gentlemen, I wish you well
home every one to his own house,
I pray God to keep you in good
health.
   We thank you, Landlord.
   God keep you so.
   We have staid there a long
while, it is very late.
   Let us go quickly to find out
our Boat.
   Truly, this man is good
company.
<pagebreak id="227" />
   So he is.
   We were not weary of his
company.
   Truly, he is very merry.
   He deserves that people should 
go to his house.
   He receives people very kindly
   Come, honest friends, we
have staid a little longer then
we thought.
   You are welcome, 
Gentlemen.
   You must make a little haste,
if you please, as much as we can
possible, Gentlemen.
   Do then, you shall have
another Shilling to drink.
   I think we shall have time
enough.
   It is fine weather, we have
wind and tide, we shall come
home in good time.
   The Moon shines bright, we
go a great pace, we shall quickly
be at <font>London</font> Bridg.
   These men are strong, they
row with all their strength.
   How pleasant it is now upon
the Water!
   Are not those fishers?
   Yes, Sir.
   Do you think they have got
any fish?
   Yes truly, they have.
   Let us buy some.
   No, no, let us not stay, we
have not too much time.
<pagebreak id="228" />
   What should we do with that
fish?
   We will eat it.
   There is enough at the 
Fish-market.
   You say right: but it is not
so good, and it is dearer.
   It is as good every jot, what
matter is it how dear it is? it is
not too dear neither.
   I do not love fish, I love flesh
better.
   You are a great flesh-eater.
   I love fish better then flesh.
   There is nothing better then
a good stewed Carp.
   You have reason.
   I love Tenches extreamly
when they are well season'd.
   So do I.
   Methinks that they do dress
fish better in <font>France</font> then here.
   That is true, the French are
better Cooks then we are.
   Yet I have eaten some well
dressed in this Country.
   I believe it.
   I was at <font>Kingston</font> a while
ago with a Gentleman a friend 
of mine, that carried thither
two great Carps from <font>London</font> :
we had them drest for us very
well, in our Inn. I did never eat
any thing so good.
<pagebreak id="229" />
   In what Inn did you lodg?
   At the Castle.
   It is true, it is a good Inn, 
there is a handsom maid which is
a very good Cook.
   Ah, ah, we are come already
to the Tower.
   If it were not so late, we
would go to visit a Gentleman a
friend of mine in the Tower that
would entertain us nobly.
   It is too late, it must be some
other time.
   When you please, we shall go
there.
   Oh God be thanked we are
arrived.
   Softly, Gentlemen, step out
one after another, we are come
in good time.
   It is not too late, let us pay
the Boat, it is good reason.
   Here, honest men, here is your
money, here is another Shilling
that we promised you to drink.
   We thank you, Gentlemen.
   Now, Gentlemen, it is time
for us to take leave one of
another.
   Gentlemen, before we part, 
will you be pleased to let me give
you a glass of Sack?
   No, Sir, we thank you, it
shall be another time.
   Come, come, it is not so late.
<pagebreak id="230" />
   For my part, I must go home,
I will not drink to day, they stay
for me at home.
   Well, Sir, since you are not
pleased, farewel, I rest your
servant.
   I thank you for your good
company
   Gentlemen, your most humble
servant.
   I wish you a good evening
and a good night.

</dialogue> <head>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TWO 
GENTLEWOMEN.</head> <dialogue>

   My Dear, what shall we
do this evening?
   We will do any thing that you 
please.
   Let us take a walk.
   I will.
   Whither shall we go?
   Let us go into the Park.
   We have never a Coach.
   Let us hire one.
   I will not go into the Park in
a Hackney Coach.
   Why not?
   Because it is not the custome for
persons of our quality.
   People would take us to be
nought.
   Let us go see my Brother.
   He will lend us his Coach.
   Is he in Town?
   Yes.
<pagebreak id="231" />
   Since when?
   Since yesterday.
   How doth he do?
   He is very well,
   God be thanked for it.
   Let us go then and desire him to
lend us his Coach.
   Do you think he will be willing
to lend it us.
   I am certain he will not deny it 
me.
   But I believe he will go along
with us.
   I should be very glad of it.
   And I also.
   Brother, I come to beg a favour
of you.
   What favour, Sister?
   But will you not refuse me?
   No, if it be any thing I can do.
   If it be in your power, will you
promise me to do it?
   What need so many words?
   Do I use to deny you any thing?
   Tell me what it is.
   I will tell it you, Brother.
   Mrs. <font>M.</font> and I would fain go
walk in the Park: but we
want a Coach.
   I understand you.
   That is as much as to say you
would gladly have mine.
   You have guess'd right, Brother.
   And where is Mrs. <font>M.</font> ?
   She is below in the Hall.
   You shall have my Coach, and
<pagebreak id="232" />
something more.
   What, Brother?
   My Company.
   What a good Brother you are.
   How well you flatter, Sister!
   I love you too much, Brother.
   Can you love me too much?
   No, I confess I cannot love you
so much as you are aimable.
   And I for my part I do not
love you.
   I do not believe you.
   I know you love me well.
   I have very certain proves of
it.
   I am very sure of it.
   Let us stop here, Sister.
   What you please, Brother.
   But if you will go with us into
the Park, it is time to be
going.
   Well, well, walk down stairs.
   You leave Mrs. <font>M.</font> all alone.
   That is not civil.
   It is not for long.
   She will have the goodness to
excuse me.
   Go &amp; intreat her to pardon me,
I wil be with you presently.
   I am going to give order for the
Horses to be put to the Coach.
   Pray do so, Brother.
   Do not make us stay too long.
<pagebreak id="233" />
   Mrs. <font>Mary</font> , my Brother is
coming down.
   He desires you to excuse him.
   He was a little busie.
   We shall have his Coach.
   He will go along with us.
   Truly? In good earnest?
   He told me so.
   Oh! what a good Brother you
have.
   He is the best young man in the
world.
   I would I had one like him.
   Really he is very civil and very
courteous.
   He is altogether gallant.
   Every body loves him.
   He is also very lovely, there he
comes.
   Madam, I intreat you to excuse
me.
   My Sister did not tell me at first
that you were here.
   Sir, your most humble servant.
   There needs no excuse where 
there is no fault.
   Madam, I think my self happy
in having the honour of
waiting upon you in the
Park.
   Sir, it shall be I that shal have
that happiness.
   Would to God, Madam, that you
would esteem it so, my desires
should be accomplished.
   I pray you, Brother, leave off
these Complements, and let 
us go into the Coach.
<pagebreak id="234" /> 
   I must obey my Sister.
   Come Madam, give me leave to
take you by the hand.
   Your servant, Sir.
   Do you leave me behind, 
Brother?
   Give me your hand.
   Sit you there.
   I will be in the Boot.
   Where you will.
   My Sister will be seen.
   She may well, Sir.
   Yes, yes, I will be seen, I fear
nothing.
   I must confess, Madam, here is
very pleasant place.
   Altogether, Sir.
   How many Coaches!
   What Coach is that?
   It is the French Embassadors.
   And that other?
   It is the Spanish Embassadors.
   Good God, what a dust here is!
   Let us go out of the dust, it
blinds me.
   Whether run all those Horses?
   There is a Race.
   Do you see that little white
Horse?
   How frolick he is!
   He runs like a little Devil.
   Here would be a great of
pleasure, were it not for the dust.
   Let us return again.
   It begins to be late.
   It is not so late as you think
it is.
   What a clock is it?
   Look on your Watch.
<pagebreak id="235" />
   It is not six a clock.
   It is a good hour.
   It is time to draw homewards.
   Lady <font>Mary</font> , you shall not go
away.
   You shall lie with me.
   I thank you, Madam.
   What would my mother say?
   What should she say?
   It is not the first time you have
done me that honour.
   I confess I have had the honour 
to lie with you, my dear.
   But it doth follow that I must
needs lie with you this 
night.
   Why not?
   I durst not without my mothers <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: motherc</comment>
leave.
   Madam, pray refuse not my 
Sister that favour.
   I will go my self and intreat
your Lady-mother to give you
leave.
   I thank you, Sir.
   That cannot be for this time.
   Let it alone for another time.
   We have some company to sup
with us to night.
   I must needs be at home.
   Besides, my Dancing-master
comes to night.
   How, so late?
   He comes alwaies at six a clock.
   What is his name.
   His name is Mr. <font>Denis Oudan</font> .
   How, is it Mr. <font>Oudan</font> that
teaches you?
<pagebreak id="236" />
   Yes, it is the same.
   I know him very well.
   I did learn of him.
   He is a very able man.
   He is an excellent Master.
   He teaches very well.
   He takes a great deal of pains.
   I love that man.
   He is mighty civil.
   How much do you give him a 
month?
   Forty Shillings.
   I did give him so much.
   Where doth he dwell?
   He dwells in, &amp;c.
   I must go and see him.
   He spoke to me of you.
   He will be glad to see you.
   He esteems you very much.
   He saith you are very
generous.
   He is a man that knows the
world. 
   He knows what belongs to
civility.
   I am much obliged to him.
   Madam, durst I intreat you to
present my service to him?
   I shall, Sir.
   Brother, we draw near home.
   I know it very well, Sister.
   Seeing Madam <font>Mary</font> will not
go home with us, we must
wait upon her home.
   That's understood.
   Sir and Madam, I give you
thanks for the honour you
<pagebreak id="237" />
have done me.
   Farewel, my Dear.
   It is we that have received it.
   Madam, oblige me with the
honour of your commands.
   Sir, I am to obey you, not to
command you.
   What do you say, Madam? you
deserve to command all men.

   Sir, your Servant.
   Where are you going so?
   I do not go, I come.
   Whence come you then?
   I come from a Play.
   I did never laugh so much in my
life at the end of the Play.
   They have plaid a Farce, a Jig
the most jestful in the world.
   You never saw such a piece.
   Pray see it.
   It will give you content.
   You will laugh your belly full.
   You'l see there a pleasant Jester.
   He will make you burst with
laughter.
   He will make you shit in your
breeches for laughing.
   There are fools every where.
   There are as many in this world,
as in any place we can go.
<pagebreak id="238" />
   You are right.
   You have it.
   You have said wel to the purpose.
   You have hit the mark.
   You understand it.
   For whom do you take me?
   For a man of business.
   Do you speak in earnest?
   You are merry.
   You are pleased to say so.
   Who saith the contrary?
   No body speaks to you.
   Be not surly.
   Are you afraid of your shadow?
   Do not put your self in a passion.
   You would make me afraid.
   This is a fine weather.
   The finest weather in the world.
   If this weather did last long, I
should be gone quickly.
   I would suddenly depart.
   To go where?
   In <font>France</font> .
   No to stay there?
   You intend to come again?
   Alas! God knows.
   It is true, we are all mortal.
   We do not know whether we
shall be alive to morrow.
   I am an old man already.
   I begin to grow old.
   How old may you be?
   Fifty.
   You do not seem so old.
   I could not think you to be
above forty.
   I am in good health, that is the 
chiefest.
<pagebreak id="239" />
   God be thanked.
   Health is a precious thing.
   It is the richest treasure we
enjoy in this world.
   Nothing more true.
   But what, do not you like this 
Country?
   Pardon me, excuse me, it is not
for that.
   A man must go and see his
friends.
   That is right.
   I wish I could travel along with
you.
   Would to God your mind were
bent that way.
   I would be huge glad of it.
   I would die even for joy.
   It would be a great honour for
me.
   Without Complement.
   If such a thing could be done.
   That is not impossible.
   It is not an thing impossible.
   I defie you.
   You dare not.
   If I should receive some monies
due to me.
   I might resolve thereupon.
   Is it but want of money?
   How! is it not necessary for
such a journey?
   I have enough for us both.
   Do not trouble your self about it.
   I give you thanks.
   I am ingaged to you.
   You are too generous.
   Think upon it then, farewel.
   You know what I am to you.

   Sir, your Servant.
   I am yours.
   How do you do?
   You see, Sir.
   I was never in better health.
   I am glad of it.
   I am glad that I have met with
you.
   So am I.
   Come along with me.
   Whether are you going?
   I am going to see my daughter.
   In what place?
   At <font>Marybone</font> .
   What doth she do there?
   What, do not you know that I
have put her at a 
Boarding-school?
   With whom?
   At one <font>Monsieur de la Mare</font> that
keeps a French School.
   Truly I did not know it.
   What doth she learn there?
   She learns to write.
   To read.
   To speak French.
   To sing. 
   To dance. 
   To play upon the Guitarre and
Virginals.
   All those things?
   Yes.
   What do you give a year?
   Five and twenty pounds.
<pagebreak id="241" />
   It is not dear.
   It is very cheap.
   I have a great mind to put mine
there also.
   I advise you to it.
   It is a good School.
   They are good people.
   Mr. <font>de la Mare</font> is a very honest
man, very courteous and
civil.
   He takes a great deal of pains to
teach his Scholars.
   He brings them to speak very
good French in a little time.
   My daughter begins to speak
already.
   How long hath she been there?
   Three months since.
   What, she can speak French
already!
   Yes truly.
   Are Children well used?
   Mighty well.
   Mrs. <font>de la Mare</font> is a very brave
woman, she takes great care 
of Maids.
   She giveth them good
instructions.
   She keeps them very neat.
   What Religion are they of?
   They are good Protestants.
   I am glad of it.
   Mr. <font>de la Mare</font> reads Prayers at
the French Church.
   In earnest?
   Yes I assure you.
   I must put my daughter there, I 
am resolved.
<pagebreak id="242" />
   You cannot do better.
   It is a thing concluded and
sure.
   I am going to speak to him now
about it.
   You will do very well.
   There is the House.
   Which?
   The first of all.
   It is a very fine House.
   Well seated.
   In a fine place.
   In a good Air.
   Is there a Garden?
   There are two.
   Is there any French Maid in
the house, to converse with
the Gentlewomen in French?
   Mr. <font>de la Mare</font> hath his daughter
which is very handsom, who
keeps company alwaies with
Gentlewomen, and talks
with them in French.
   What do you tell me.
   I tell you nothing but what is
true.
   She is a young Maid that is very
well qualified.
   She hath a very fine voice.
   She sings rarely.
   She dances perfectly.
   She understands the Art of 
Musick very well.
   She playes upon the Virginals.
   She is very well bred, very
discreet.
   Those are fine qualities.

GENTLEWOMEN, 
WHETHER <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: &quot;WHE-&quot; ONLY, ON PREVIOUS LINE</comment> IT IS         
NECESSARY FOR 
WOMEN TO BE LEARNED.</head> <dialogue>

   Good morrow, my Dear.
   How dost thou do?
   Very well, my dear, at thy
service.
   Prethee take a seat, and sit
down by the fire.
   I shall have soon done.
   What art thou busie about then?
   What art thou doing then?
   I am writing a Sonnet fair.
   What Sonnet?
   A Sonnet I composed
yesterday.
   How canst thou make Verses?
   Somtimes I divert my self to
make some, to pass my time.
   When I have no other 
business.
   Thou dost jest, it belongs to none
but men to make Verses.
   Why not to women as well as to
men?
   Because men have more wit then
we have.
   At least they will have it so.
   I am not of that opinion.
   I believe that women in 
general have as much wit as
men.
<pagebreak id="244" />
   But generally men go beyond
us.
   Why dost thou believe that?
   Because it is men that do all.
   They make war.
   They rule all.
   They do possesse Offices.
   They get womens livelihood.
   They know Sciences.
   They compose Books, and do all
manner of other things,
which women are not capable
of.
   And thou dost infer out of all
that, that men have more wit
then women.
   It seems so, and they prove it
themselves by Scripture.
   Which way?
   They say that man was created
first, and that the woman was
made of one of his ribs, as it
is true.
   It doth not follow for all that,
that they have got more wit
then we: for beasts that
have got none, were created
before man.
   God created the noblest last of 
all.
   But God made the woman
subject unto man, and he will
have her obey him, as being
the most worthy of the two.
   But rather, it is because the
woman is the most worthy, that
God would have her obey
man, as a fierce and proud 
creature.
<pagebreak id="245" />
   For there is more force of wit
to yield and obey, then to
command imperiously.
   Thou speakest wonderful wel:
but yet S. <font>Paul</font> saith, that the
man is the head of the woman.
   It is true.
   But are not women members
of Christ as well as men?
   There is no doubt.
   Doth the image of God
consist in the body, or in the Spirit
or mind?
   I rather believe that it is in
the Spirit: for God is not a 
body.
   Why then should not the wit
of women be as good as that of 
men, seeing that the woman is
the image of God as well as
man?
   But S. <font>Paul</font> will not have
women speak in the Church.
   It is a sign that he doth not
hold them so capable as men.
   No, it is not that. The thing
only is, that he doth not hold it
so convenient, that women be
mixt with men in a 
Church-counsel. For he foresaw that
this might cause some disorder
by reason of the small account <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: acoount</comment>
that men make of womens
judgment and wit.
   But it doth not follow, that
they are not capable of all
functsons of spirit as men are.
<pagebreak id="246" />
   It is a thing that we could 
hardly perswade them.
   That would be easie enough,
if they would hear reason.
   Is not the good behaviour of
women a sufficient proof of their
wisdom?
   Are they seen to fuddle, and
commit murders as men do?
   It is true, their Sex is much
more vicious then ours.
   But they do prevail above us,
because they go beyond us in
strenth of body.
   And that thing should bring
them to the knowledg of truth.
   How so?
   Because we see that among all
creatures, those which nature
gave less strength to, she hath
furnished them with more skill
and understanding.
   And those that are the
strongest, are the more stupid.
   Truly thou art in the right.
   That is commonly observed,
that the weakest are nearer to
reason, and have a more
powerful instinct then those whom
Nature hath endued with other
advantages.
   For a proof thereof, are there
any creatures seen lesser and
more industrious the Silk worm
the Bee, and the Ant?
   Thou dost understand then,
<pagebreak id="247" />
that according to this rule,
Nature having given more
strength unto men then to 
women, she ought also to have
given us more wit and more
judgment.
   Thou dost argue strongly.
   And if it be so, why should
we not addict our selves to the
study of good letters as well as
men?
   But however, it seems
notwithstanding, that it is not the
part of a woman to make use of
a pen.
   What we must have a 
clear-sighted mind, and solid
judgment, and we must not imploy
them but only to curl our hair!
   That would be to abuse those
favours we have received from
heaven.
   The great <font>Origene</font> was of
another mind.
   For as he did not judg our
sex less capable of Philosophy
then his own, he kept his School
open for maids and women.
   Who was that great <font>Origen</font>
thou speakest of?
   He was the greatest
Philosopher of his time.
   He was experienc'd in all
manner of Sciences and
Disciplines, both Divine &amp; humane.
   In what Country did he
teach.
   In <font>Grecia</font> .
   Hast thou been in his School?
<pagebreak id="248" />
   I should be very old to have
been there.
   He hath then been dead a
long time.
   He died in the year of our 
Lord 260.
   We were not yet born.
   Sure enough.
   Certainly thou must needs
have been at some good School:
for methinks thou dost discourse
altogether like a Philosopher.
   Alas! my dear, my knowledg
is but little. But in spight of
all men I will study to go beyond
them, or at least to equalize 
them.
   How happy art thou to have
so much wit!
   I have no more then another:
but I hope by cultivating it, to
bring it to maturity.
   If I thought to do any good 
in study, as well as thou hast
done, I would practise it.
   It is a very easie matter.
   Reading of good Books gives
us great instructions.
   But how comes it to pass, 
that men will not have us to be
Scholars?
   I cannot imagine the reason
of it.
   Sure it is to gain our
admiration.
   That would not be the way to
come where they aime at, seeing
<pagebreak id="249" />
a body cannot admire a thing
unknown.
   It may be it is to make us the 
more subject.
   If it be for that end, they have
but little generosity. And if
they have dominion or command
over us, it is but little glorious,
to rule over stupid and ignorant
creatures.
   I cannot then imagine why
they approve not learning in our
Sex as well as in their own.
   The best reason they give for
it, it is (say they) that study
doth not agree with the care a
woman ought to have of her
children, and of her house.
   Yet that reason hath no place
but with them that have a mind
to marry.
   But how shall a woman bring
up her children in the fear of
God, and in the love of vertue
if she be ignorant?
   Some men are so stupid as to
say that a woman is learned
enough, when she can distinguish
her husbands bed from anothers.
   They think that honesty and
learning are things that cannot
agree together.
   Those that are of that foolish
opinion, are quite ignorant.
   They love that which they
enjoy, and that which is like them.
<pagebreak id="250" />
   There are some men that are
more rational, and that esteem
vertu where it is.
   Methinks that a learned man
that should have a stupid woman
could not have much content in
her company.
   How can a stupid woman
know vertue and distingish it
from vice?
   Certainly learning bring one
to the knowledg of vertue better
then ignorance.
   Ignorance is the mother of all
vices.
   Thou art in the right: for
it is the cause of idleness, and
idleness is the root of all evil.
   Ignorance is alwaies
contemptible in what sex soever it is
seen: but learning attracts the
esteem and love of every body.
   Thou hast wholly perswaded
me to apply my self to study, in
shewing me that women are no
more incapable of it then men.
   I am glad I have given thee
a better opinion of our sex then
thou hadst before.
