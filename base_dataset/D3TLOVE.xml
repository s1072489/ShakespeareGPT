</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot my Lord fix it upon 
any particular man, but I believe I was told of it by <font>Alford</font> ,   
or <font>Far</font> , or <font>Bains</font> ; for I was not there at 
that time. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know about the meeting at   
the <font>Swan</font> at <font>Dowgate</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord I was not there. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
Then my Lord, he may tell you what he doth know?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, upon our meeting in some place or   
other, I cannot tell where, I cannot tell 
the time, nor the place, but either at the <font>Swan</font> in               
<font>Fish-street</font> , or at the <font>Swan</font> at <font>Dowgate</font> , or in 
<font>Cat-eaten street</font> ; in one of these three places, I cannot        
punctually remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was at that meeting? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
Mr. <font>William Drake</font> , Captain <font>Titus</font> , Major 
<font>Alford</font> , Captain <font>Far</font> , Captain <font>Potter</font> , and my selfe;    
and I do not know how many more, or whether 
any more, or no. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What past there?                  
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was there agreed, that Captain <font>Titus</font> 
should go over to <font>Jersy</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was he        
imployed about? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The end of his 
going, was to endeavour to work an agreement between the King and    
<font>Scots</font> , according to the Covenant. 
That was the end that was propounded. And in order to his going, wee 
did agree to furnish 
him with money for the present, and made some kind of promise to     
maintaine him while he was 
out. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What money was he furnished with?           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot be punctuall in that, but 
about a hundred pounds. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who should pay it?       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I paid twenty pounds of 
it, but I cannot tell who paid the rest. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom 
did you pay it? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To <font>Mr. Drake</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Ask him whether when this was sent   
to <font>Jersy</font> , was there not a return made?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, go on, There was your twenty pounds      
gone? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the substance 
of what I can say of his going. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this twenty  
pounds that you laid out of your owne, 
or did you collect it of some of the rest, or did you gather any of  
it again? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot 
say that I did. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
My Lord, I tell you the truth, I doe not know 
whether I did, or no: for I remember it was determined that we       
should gather it at that meeting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not <font>Mr. Love</font> know of the collection?   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say he did, it may be, 
he might, but I dare not say upon my oath, that he knew of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ask him what return <font>Titus</font> made, what      
answer, and what account he gave?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>M. Alford</font> went to <font>Calice</font> to meet     
<font>Titus</font> , and <font>Titus</font> did send word that the Councell of
State heard of his being there, and thereupon desired that some body 
might be sent over to him; for 
he had something to communicate which he could not well do by        
writing, and thereupon <font>Mr. Alford</font> 
was sent. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Ask him where the letter was  
read? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The letter that 
<font>Titus</font> sent, was read by Mr. <font>William Drake</font> .                  
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At his house, as I 
think, for I cannot certainly remember, I did not say, upon my       
Examination that it was read any where.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether were not you moved to go?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was some motion to that end.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVho moved it, and where? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
VVho moved it, I cannot tell; it was moved, 
I think, in <font>Mr. Loves</font> Chamber. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was           
<font>Mr. Love</font> there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Mr. Love</font> move it?                     
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He will not say it? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I      
cannot say it upon my oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, so much he saith, that it was moved  
in <font>Mr. Loves</font> chamber, then he may give 
you an account of <font>Mr. Alfords</font> return, and where the account was  
given? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The returne 
of <font>Mr. Alfords</font> account was given at <font>Mr. Loves</font> house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat was it? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The return   
he made in generall was by a 
Narrative, and 
a copie of a letter from the King: there was with the Narrative that 
which was said to be the copie
of a letter from the King. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the substance  
of that letter? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The
<pagebreak id="35" />
contents of the letter, as I remember, was first, he exprest a great 
deal of affection to the Ministry of 
<font>England</font> in generall, and promised great favour when he was in a  
condition to do it, and desired them to 
continue stedfast in the way they were in. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was   
this letter published at <font>Mr. Loves</font> 
study?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was read. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was          
<font>Mr. Love</font> there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, to be positive, that 
<font>Mr. Love</font> was there, I dare not say; but <font>Mr. Love</font> was there   
at that meeting, either at the beginning or 
ending, but whether the letter was read at Mr. <font>Loves</font> house, I    
dare not swear; the Narrative from <font>Titus</font> , 
was a very long one, and very well drawn, I cannot give an account   
of it now: the whole of it was 
after this manner; To give an account to us of all the transactions  
that had happened since his going 
out of <font>England</font> , he did give an account of his usage by the      
Cavalier Party, that was against the Kings 
agreement with the <font>Scots</font> , because there was some did incline to 
his agreement with them, and there 
was another party was much against it, and he gave a very large      
account of that: after that he went on 
describing his disposition and condition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was the substance of the rest. Was there 
not some propositions for giving of thanks 
to <font>Titus</font> , for his so wel managing his affairs there?            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a motion made by some body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who made the motion? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I      
cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not an hundred pounds more to be sent     
agreed upon there? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was more money contributed; who agreed  
to lend any? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams?</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, To 
that question, I cannot say, who propounded it; but that there was   
money sent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who contributed? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did my   
share.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much was that? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I    
remember, ten pounds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom did you pay it, and where did you pay 
it?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then they shewed him his Examination.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, look upon it, and be well advised.        
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams looks upon his Examination.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I paid it to Mr. <font>Drake</font> at his fathers     
shop in Cheap-side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Next about the Commission and instructions to 
be sent, what do you know of that?
when this letter was read from the King, and published in Mr.        
<font>Loves</font> study, whether was there not a 
Commission agreed upon, to give instructions to treat with the King  
at <font>Bredah</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a motion made at Mr. <font>Loves</font>      
house, that there should be a commission and 
instructions drawn and sent; the motion was made at <font>Mr. Loves</font>    
house, they were there spoken of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By whom, who did the Dialogue run between? Did  
<font>Mr. Love</font> do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely, for my part, I did not then take such 
speciall notice, that I dare at this time 
upon my oath, deliver any thing positively against any particular    
man, but generally all spake 
something, as I remember. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any debate   
to mend the instructions? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, 
Sir, not as I remember. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not <font>Mr. Gibbons</font>  
bring the rough draft of the Commission?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely, I think he did, as I remember he did, 
I have spoken of the Comission 
and instructions that were debated then and there, and that many of  
these persons here mentioned,
were there; but that some of them mentioned, might not be there      
then, is very likely.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr. <font>Love</font> there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
That he was there some part of this time, I am very 
confident. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it in his study?                    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there a Commission agreed upon to be      
sent? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the word <font>agreed</font> , I 
cannot tell what to say to it; Agreed, holds forth as if a vote      
passed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not a generall consent?               
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Being upon my oath, I desire to be 
cautious, for I must be tender in speaking the truth in this case,   
and I do not know what to make of the 
word <font>agreed</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it approved of?              
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To my understanding the thing was thus, 
that at such meetings as these, we were not absolutely formall, as   
if we had been established by a Court 
of Justice, to act thus, and that there should be prefaces, and such 
things, or such methods observed, as 
that any man undertook to make a preface, either at the beginning,   
or conclusion, but it was spoken to 
by many persons, and by every person spoken to, and in this sense it 
was agreed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were there not instructions agreed upon, and  
all this in <font>M. Loves</font> study? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they not read there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
I think they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who read them? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot     
tell who read them, but they were read, and I think 
Mr. <font>Drake</font> read them </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the contents of 
the Commission? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 
contents or the substance of the Commission was to this effect.      
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>This he reads out of his Examination.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
We the Presbyterians of <font>England</font> , do authorize you the Lord      
<font>Willughby</font> of <font>Parham</font> , <font>Edward
<pagebreak id="36" />
Massey</font> , <font>Richard Graves</font> , <font>Cilas Titus</font> , and <font>James        
Bunce</font> , to assist our Brethren, the <font>Scotch</font> 
Commissioners in their Treaty with the King, according to the        
instructions annexed; I dare not swear 
it in these words, but to this purpose it was; The substance of the  
instructions were to use all 
the arguments they could to move the King to give the <font>Scotch</font>     
satisfaction, and to take the 
Covenant; such arguments were mentioned, as the then condition of    
affaires best afforded, 
particularly how things stood in <font>England</font> at that time: which did 
all of them cry out for an 
agreement, and gave them full power as to all things, and what       
should be concluded by them, should 
be confirmed by these here; but I cannot say so, but what words      
were, were to this purpose, saving 
this conclusion, that what was concluded, should be confirmed here,  
I do not remember that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not some debate by what warrant     
they should act in this Commission 
and instructions? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were some such words at the 
meeting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did Mr. <font>Love</font> say? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I   
cannot remember what <font>Mr. Love</font> did say, or 
whether he said any thing or nothing at that time, but that there    
were such words said, I have said 
it, but by whom, I cannot fix it upon any particular person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not debated by what warrant they       
should derive power to themselves to send this 
Commission? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was such language, but by whom, I 
cannot say, I thinke 
by <font>William Drake</font> . It was because the King had writ this letter, 
wherein he desired there 
should be such instructions; there was something spoken of the       
secluded members, but by whom, 
I do not know; there was a Proposition whether the authority should  
be taken from the secluded 
Members, or from some other. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not Mr.         
<font>Love</font> then say, Come, let it go on. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare not say  
so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not propounded at the meeting to write 
to the Queen, and to <font>Jermine</font> , and 
<font>Piercy</font> , for them to mediate with the King to agree with the     
<font>Scots</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams's Examination was here againe read.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, So much of this, as I think to be true, 
I shall own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not a letter writ from <font>Piercy</font> , 
that a considerable summe of money was 
fit to be sent to the King, and what answer was given; was it not to 
be done till the King and 
<font>Scots</font> should agree, and then to raise the money?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That there was such a 
letter writ, I must needs acknowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was it read? at Mr. <font>Love's</font> house?   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No certainly, I onely 
saw it in <font>Mason's</font> own hands, and I remember he shewed it me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Next ask him whether there was not a letter   
written about <font>August</font> last to some here, 
that <font>Massey</font> had back friends in <font>Scotland</font> , complaining he    
could not be promoted there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
did understand there was such a letter, but by what way, I do not    
know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not the letter communicated at M.          
<font>Loves</font> house, and were not you present when this letter 
was read at Mr. <font>Loves</font> house, wherein <font>Massey</font> complained he    
had back friends in <font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No 
certainly, that letter was not to my remembrance read there, I heard 
of such a letter, but saw it not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, ask him whether he was not appointed 
to draw up some letters. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There 
were some I should have had a hand in drawing. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
Who were appointed with you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As 
I remember, Captain <font>Potter</font> , Captain <font>Massey</font> , and Mr.        
<font>Gibbons</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But was there no meeting 
upon it, was <font>M. Love</font> named? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Love</font> was    
not named. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not one 
<font>Sterks</font> a <font>Scotch</font> Agent here, that kept intelligence from      
<font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know, there was 
such a one, we took to be an Agent here. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he   
meet at your meetings? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he 
did meet sometimes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he at <font>Mr. Loves</font>      
house at any time? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Act came forth for banishing the     
<font>Scots</font> , was there not a collection for his 
charges, and were not you at <font>M. Loves</font> house when it was agreed   
to? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you contribute money? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I  
did contribute 10 or 12s. I cannot tell which.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What discourse upon <font>Dunbar</font> fight was      
there from this person that is already spoken of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the thing, if you please to help my      
memory; for there were so many particulars in this 
correspondency, that I cannot tell whereabouts it is I am to speak   
to, I am very uncertain where 
abouts it is I am <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: a I m</comment> to speak to.                
</dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak the certainty as it was in your breast.      
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if 
it be doubtfull to me, how can I be certaine, and charge it upon my  
memory? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak the 
truth? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will speak the truth. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
Do so then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Here again Adams looks upon his
Examinations.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is some of it I did set    
down, that I dare not own upon my oath, I 
then did deliver it so when I set it down.
<pagebreak id="37" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Love</font> know that this <font>Scotch</font>    
man was the <font>Scotch</font> Agent? did you not take 
notice that Mr. <font>Love</font> took notice of him? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do   
think he did, as farre as I understand, he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not Mr. <font>Love</font> generally tell you the   
cause of the meetings? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not hear Mr. <font>Love</font> say, that this  
<font>Sterks</font> was the <font>Scotch</font> Agent? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
never heard Mr. <font>Love</font> say so, but I knew this, that by our usuall 
meetings Mr. <font>Love</font> did understand 
him as I did, to be the <font>Scotch</font> Agent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How often did you meet at Mr. <font>Loves</font>       
house? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, it may be 
seven, or eight, or ten times; an uncertain time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was at Mr. <font>Loves</font> study?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether so many times, I know not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, ask him whether it was not at Mr.    
<font>Loves</font> study when mony was 
propounded to be raised for <font>Massey</font> , and <font>Titus</font> .             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was that in Mr. <font>Loves</font> study? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I  
cannot tell 
whether it was in his study, or in the lower room, I am apt to       
believe it was in the lower room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr. <font>Love</font> there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>      
Certainly, he was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the contents of the letter?            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The contents of the letter I cannot 
remember. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether did it not declare the poverty 
of his condition? And was it not 
after <font>Dunbar</font> fight? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this letter from <font>Massey</font> , read at     
Master <font>Loves</font> house, was this for money? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it agreed for money to bee raised?         
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you take the word 
<font>agreed</font> , as I formerly propounded, it was so. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How was the money to be raised, and in what   
manner? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was by 
those that were privy to the contribution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not Mr. <font>Love</font> there, and did not he    
write down the sums that were to be 
contributed? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This I must needs say, that Master     
<font>Love</font> had papers in his hand, and hee did 
write something, but I did not see what he did write, and every man  
did write that was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you conceive so, that Mr. <font>Love</font>    
summed up every mans sum? did he put the 
letter of their names before them, when he writ the sums?            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not there a letter penn'd by Master       
<font>Love</font> , and Doctor <font>Drake</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To that 
question, I must say there was a letter, but I cannot deliver it     
upon my oath that it was penn'd by Master 
<font>Love</font> , or Doctor <font>Drake</font> , but it was taken to be so, and I    
thought it was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom was that letter directed?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell to whom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom was it declared to be directed? to    
whom was it declared to be written?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the Generall Assembly and Kirk of             
<font>Scotland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this at Mr. <font>Loves</font> house too?            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was <font>Mr. Love</font> present, and did approve of  
it? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Love</font> was present at 
some time of this meeting: the reason why I thought it to be of      
Master <font>Loves</font> , or Doctor <font>Drakes</font> 
drawing, was nothing but meerly the language of it, it being in      
order to promote the ends of the 
Covenant, and all the whole language was couched to that purpose,    
and taking notice of the want 
of respect to <font>Massey</font> , and the <font>English</font> , and of their being  
beaten.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, This is very high; for he tels you   
this letter was approved of, and directed to 
be sent, and this was after <font>Dunbar</font> fight, after we were ingaged  
in bloud.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Here Adams read out of his Examination, as followeth</font> :</nonSpeech>      
<nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was also 
a large letter in the nature of a Declaration penn'd by Master       
<font>Love</font> , and Doctor <font>Drake</font> , and 
approved of by most of the Presbyterian party, Ministers, and        
other, and directed to the Generall 
Assembly, and Kirk of <font>Scotland</font> , subscribed by none, which       
contained the substance of what was declared by 
<font>Titus</font> , and <font>Massey</font> , but durst not promise any great sums of 
money till they appeared more 
considerable, and grew nearer action; the businesse required higher  
spirits then was for the present, and 
the businesse required a considerable summe: but to leave no means   
un-attempted when the businesse 
was feasable. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>So far he reads.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Major <font>Adams</font> is now upon his oath to tell  
you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, As well as I 
remember, it did put forth much after this sort, but I cannot swear  
it in these words, but that is the substance of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not this agreed and declared at           
<font>Mr. Loves</font> house, that such a letter should be written to 
the Honourable Committee, and to the Kirk. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ad.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I answer,   
that after the same manner as all other 
things are agreed at such meetings as this is, but I have no ground, 
and do not know why I should 
say Master <font>Love</font> and Doctor <font>Drake</font> penn'd it.
<pagebreak id="38" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ask him for the substance of the letter,      
whether it were not as he hath told you, and 
whether he did not say, they could not promise a considerable sum of 
money. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly, 
either in that letter, or some other, there was some such expressions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVell, it was about that time, and in that       
letter, or in some other letter, and at M. <font>Loves</font> 
house. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Ask him if there was not an      
Agent come from <font>Scotland</font> , and a way laid 
at <font>Kendall</font> for a correspondency between these Gentlemen here,    
and some of <font>Scotland</font> , and whether 
one <font>Groves</font> was not sent thither? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was       
something obscure; that there was such a thing, 
I do verily believe, because it went amongst us for a truth, but how 
to make it out for a truth upon my 
oath, I cannot tell. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Mr. Love</font> know of it?  
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ask him what he knows concerning Colonel       
<font>Bamfield's</font> man coming hither?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Concerning that I know nothing, but I confesse I 
had some <font>Item</font> , that at that time there 
was something found; and this is all I can say to that, I cannot     
guesse the time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it after the fight at <font>Dunbar</font> ?        
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, that it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the meetings at <font>Mr. Loves</font> house?     
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say all, but all that I know of, were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ask whether upon the large letter, <font>Massey</font> 
did not write that things were well setled in 
<font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Many of these things were understood 
so, and taken for granted amongst us, but I 
can say no otherwise, I thought it to be so; but I know not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you not present, or at <font>Mr. Loves</font>     
house, when these letters were read, that they were 
in a hopefull condition? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say so.           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can you say? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As before, 
That it went for a truth amongst us, and that is as much as I can    
say to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not a large letter inviting your    
friends to union? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
understand the other letter to be this you propound to me now.       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now we speak of a letter 
from Alderman <font>Bunce</font> , and others? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot      
speak particularly to that; for I did not see 
them, but they were told me by one or other of those that were of    
the correspondency, and this is all I 
can say. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is the truth? Doe you conceive it is 
so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we shall not trouble him with that,  
my Lord. Ask him one question more, 
What did <font>Mr. Love</font> tell you, that if the Presbyterians got the    
upper hand again? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those 
words, I think, did but amount to this, that if the Presbyterians    
were in armes again, by the blessing 
of God, the Cavaliering party might be prevented from getting the day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who do you mean by the Correspondents?         
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By correspondents I mean <font>Alford</font> ,
<font>Potter</font> , <font>Far</font> , &amp;c. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not Mr. <font>Love</font>    
one of them? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I took him to be so, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I pray ask him, whether any of these  
pretended or supposed letters, were ever 
received by me, any one of them, or that I writ one of them, or      
mended one of them. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
cannot say that ever I saw him do any such thing, nor did I ever see 
him write any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you saw the letters there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
That I have said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ask him whether I gave my consent to the      
sending away of this he calls a commission, 
and instructions, about the time of the Treaty at <font>Bredah</font> .       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I will not swear that, 
and upon my oath I cannot. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you not, I will    
presse you to nothing, you said even 
now, you did not know he did send them away, but you did say, he was 
privy to them, and to the 
debates of them: did he declare any dissent? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I      
cannot say that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you ask him this question? Whether he read 
the letters that he pretends were sent
into <font>England</font> , or <font>Scotland</font> , or whether he heard them read?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That he swears? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not      
swear that these were the contents of them exactly. 
I was there when these letters were read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He onely heard them read. </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
If there were halfe a score that had 
correspondency, and received letters, and come together, and one of  
the most confiding men read them, will any 
man say, that he will not believe these were right read, such a      
hear-say as this, is such a hear-say as 
you may take notice of. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But let him prove how it  
was a correspondency on my part.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not say that <font>Mr. Love</font> was one of the   
Correspondents, I deny that I said so, I said 
I conceived him to be so, but that is not, that he was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did debate together, and met together,    
and received instructions, and therefore he 
may very aptly conceive he was a Correspondent?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doth he swear that J assented?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Adams.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> J did not swear so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He saith, money was sent to <font>Titus</font> , pray  
ask him whether by Agents J imployed?

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Declare now what you know of this businesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, for the paper I was examined about, 
as for knowing <font>Titus</font> , I never saw him 
in my life but one quarter of an hour in a private house, and I knew 
nothing of his businesse any where. 
For the other, <font>Alford</font> coming over with letters, I was at Mr.     
<font>Loves</font> house, and when I was there, there 
was severall men there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what part of Mr. <font>Loves</font> house?          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I conceive in his chamber, for I went up to 
severall that were there, whose names I can positively say, for two  
or three of them, though I cannot 
remember the other absolutely, though I conceive most I have named   
in my examination were there; 
<font>C. Potter</font> was there, and Doctor <font>Drake</font> , and M. <font>Alford</font> ,  
and M. <font>Love</font> was there somtimes, though 
divers times he went out, some coming to speak with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not a copy of a letter said to be   
sent from the King, read there? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
I remember no such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not a narrative. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
Yes, from <font>Titus</font> , wherein he declared the Kings 
inclinations to make peace with the <font>Scots</font> ; but that his wicked  
counsell about him did hinder it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not this of what <font>Titus</font> had related    
from <font>Jersey</font> , the narrative of what had past between 
him and the King there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not M. <font>Alford</font> sent to receive an      
account from him to <font>Calice</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>William Drake</font> 
did tell me so afterwards. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did M. <font>Alford</font>     
deliver no account there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
think it was M. <font>Alford</font> read the narrative.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he make no relation by word of mouth?      
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, I cannot remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You cannot remember it was read?               
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am sure it was read, and at Mr. <font>Loves</font> 
house. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And he was present sometimes?              
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, sometimes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What mony was there agreed upon to be          
provided for <font>Titus</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know of none. It was moved by Captain         
<font>Potter</font> that there might be forty pounds, but 
I know of none, nor was it agreed by M. <font>Love</font> , M. <font>Drake</font> or   
my self, that we should lay down any at all.
<pagebreak id="41" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not meet with <font>William Drake</font> , and 
desire to go along with him to see 
<font>Titus</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did so, but I think <font>Drake</font>        
desired it. I met him in <font>Newgate</font> market, and, 
saith he, I am going to see <font>Titus</font> , goe along with me; I said, I 
never saw him, nor did I know 
him: sayes he, You shall not stay at all: whereupon he went and      
found him in a Cheese-mongers 
house in <font>New-gate</font> market.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What discourse had you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He   
said, he was newly come out of <font>Holland</font> , and he had 
been with the King, and he was a man of excellent parts for his      
years, and that he was inclinable to 
what was good, but that he had such desperate evill Counsell about   
him; and that hee did much pity 
him, and that his Clergie especially was wicked; and he propounded   
nothing to us, nor did I ever 
see his face afterwards, and this is about two years and a halfe     
ago; and for any other 
meetings at the Swan Taverne, or for any Agents, I never met him, or 
saw him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe you not remember at any meeting, that     
there was money propounded for 
Captaine <font>Titus</font> , or for <font>Alfords</font> being sent over to           
<font>Calice</font> ? Speak what you know of that, and by 
whom it was told you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Major <font>Alford</font> himselfe    
told me he was to meet his son, and 
he went over upon that score; but after he was gone, <font>William       
Drake</font> told me he was gone to see or 
meet Captaine <font>Titus</font> , I am not certaine of the words; and when   
he did come againe, which was 
the next time I heard of him, then <font>William Drake</font> comes to me,    
and desired mee to goe 
along with him, for I think he went up and down to every man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You thinke then that <font>William Drake</font> was    
the prime man. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, hee was 
the Actor and the Agent that moved all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When <font>Alford</font> returned, he desired you to   
go with him. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To Mr. <font>Loves</font> house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat was done at <font>Mr. Loves house</font> ?       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were some papers read, which 
<font>Alford</font> , as I take it, read, or <font>William Drake</font> , I am not     
certaine which; but read it was, of a 
relation, that <font>Titus</font> came out of <font>Iersy</font> , and had seen the    
King there, and the <font>Scots</font> Commissioners, 
and that the King had a great inclination to agree with the          
<font>Scots</font> Commissioners, and that he was 
a man of excellent inclinations and parts, and had a great desire to 
agree, but his Counsell, and 
wicked crew about him would not let him; and he said, as I remember, 
that the King was a kind 
of a Prisoner with them there, and said, his Counsell did hinder     
him, or else, if he were from 
them, hee would agree with the <font>Scots</font> Commissioners.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, this paper was read; this Narrative   
was read, and in Mr. <font>Loves</font> house; was not Mr. 
<font>Love</font> present? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not able to say hee was,    
when I came in, I remember he was not in 
the roome, and he was there two or three times while I was there,    
but he was severall times called out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe not you know there was an agreement of a  
letter written back to <font>Titus</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can remember no such thing, but I think       
<font>William Drake</font> told me so, as I remember, 
but that was two years ago, I do verily believe by what I conceived, 
was of his writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could wish that mens consciences could not    
bee scrupled to believe so much of a 
Minister, more then of a Magistrate; I hold it pernicious doctrine   
for any man to think he is bound 
more to obey the Minister, then the Magistrate: I ask you then       
before the Magistrate here, who
was present at that meeting? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>William Drake.</font> I  
am sure, and Major <font>Alford</font> was there, 
and Captain <font>Potter</font> , and severall others, as I remember, Master  
<font>Ienkyns</font> .  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was in <font>Mr. Loves</font> house, was it not   
in his study? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell that, 
I say, as I conceive, that Master <font>Ienkyns</font> , and Master <font>Case</font>  
were there, but positively I cannot say 
it, and <font>Mr. Iackson</font> , and <font>Mr. Nalton</font> , I think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat say you of Mr. <font>Watson</font> ?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think he was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat say you of Mr. <font>Herring</font> ?            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat say you of <font>Mr. Cauton</font> ?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In truth, I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat say you of <font>Mr. Robinson</font> ?           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you of <font>Mr. Drake</font> ?               
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVas Colonell <font>Vaughan</font> there?              
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I conceive he was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Master <font>Iackson</font> there?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Capt. <font>Far</font> , and   
Capt. <font>Potter</font> 
there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe so. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr.   
<font>Gibbons</font> there? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you of Mr. <font>Sterks</font> ?              
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir, I do not know it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not know him to be the <font>Scotch</font> Agent?   
Was he not taken among you to be an 
Agent from <font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he was a <font>Scotch</font> 
man.
<pagebreak id="42" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And for contribution of money, what money did  
you pay, and to whom? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two 
five pounds to Mr. <font>Drake</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what use? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For charitable 
uses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he asked it of you so, or for that        
purpose; but afterwards, What did you learn it 
was employed about? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, he did not tell me how he 
did employ this money; but afterwards, 
I heard him say, that he had sent <font>Titus</font> money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you contribute to <font>Sterks</font> his      
going into <font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ten shillings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And who else did contribute, that was there?   
and how much was the sum that was 
collected? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much do you guess, or have heard?          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Four or five pounds, I think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ask him who gave the Scotchmen money?          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, I did give several Scotchmen 
money, both to poor Ministers and others, that were banished by the  
Act, because I knew they were 
very poor, and knew not how to get away; and I did it out of charity 
towards them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because the State had an ill opinion of them,  
therefore you had a good opinion of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was one Minister that had twelve children 
that was banished.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you at any meetings at Mr. <font>Loves</font>      
after <font>Dunbar</font> fight? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No not I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Fast were you at, and who officiated   
at those Fasts? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was at Major <font>Adams</font> , 
and Colonel <font>Bartons</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did exercise at those Fasts? was Mr.       
<font>Love</font> , Mr. <font>Jenkyns</font> , Mr. <font>Case</font> , any of them?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe they were, I conceive so, I profess I    
cannot remember, I believe Mr. <font>Jenkyns</font> was 
there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not Mr. <font>Love</font> one of them?              
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the occasion of those Fasts?          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know no particular occasion, but for the 
good of the two Nations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know they were for the good of the  
two Nations? was it not for an agreement 
between the King, and the <font>Scots</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess,   
it was for the Good of both Nations, as both 
Nations are the Church of God; and do both profess themselves        
Protestants, and of one Religion; 
and I conceived, it was my duty to pray for the good of them both.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But was there not some expressions for a 
blessing upon the Treaty at <font>Breda</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
cannot remember such expressions; for in such duties, I desire to    
have my heart lifted up unto God:
And, my Lord, it is a great while ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you say your heart is lifted up unto God, 
when your understanding is in your heels?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I do not remember one passage in       
prayer a week after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is in ordinary meetings, but this was for 
both Nations; but by what did you know, 
that this was for the good of both Nations, and why was it pretended 
to be for the good of both? 
and, my Lord, why they should not meet before, but just at that      
time, and at a private Fast? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
think that since the Nations of <font>England</font> and <font>Scotland</font> were at 
oddes, I have been at twenty Fasts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, ask him, whether he were not late     
with <font>Potter</font> , and did not meet with him about 
Letters from 
<font>Bamfield</font> , and whither they went to read them? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
This was about <font>February</font> or <font>March</font> 
last, he told me he received Letters, and desired me to go along     
with him to Mr. <font>Loves</font> , and after Dr. 
<font>Drake</font> came in, and then these Letters were read; and I profess,  
I know not from whence they came, 
nor the man; and so did Mr. <font>Love</font> declare, That he never saw, nor 
knew, nor heard of <font>Bamfield</font> 
before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he not make mention of Parties in          
<font>Scotland</font> , that one party was for the King, 
another for the King and Kirk, a third neither for King, nor Kirk?   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But who were those he named, that were men for 
the King? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think, <font>Hamilton</font> and 
his party. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And who for the King and Kirk?         
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Argile</font> and <font>Leshley</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And who neither for King nor Kirk?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Straughan</font> and <font>Car</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, did he tell you of the young Kings       
escaping? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Something there was in that, 
but he was fetched back again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What said he of <font>Argile</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Nothing at all, as I remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there not an expression, That they were    
now agreed to receive in the whole Nation, 
unless it were those that were notoriously scandalous and            
excommunicated? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe 
there was.
<pagebreak id="43" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did it not mention five thousand pounds for    
providing of shipping? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; in 
the Narrative or Letter, whether there related at that time, I know  
not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what mention was there made, who were fit  
to command in <font>England</font> , if that party 
should come from thence into <font>England</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I       
conceive there was three Noblemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name them. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord of        
<font>Suffolk</font> , my Lord of <font>Warwick</font> , and my Lord of 
<font>Manchester</font> , or either of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was propounded                            
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: prepounded</comment> by <font>Bamfield</font> , but I    
hope those Lords were more noble, then to do any 
such thing: Was there not another Letter that came with that of      
<font>Bamfields</font> , sent by my Lord of <font>Argile</font> , 
and it was onely, That there should be an apbrobation of him: And    
was this Letter likewise read at 
the same time, and at the same place? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was then propounded for money to be       
raised for <font>Bamfield</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, Captain 
<font>Potter</font> did make mention for Forty pounds to be raised, Ten       
pounds for Colonel <font>Bamfields</font> man, and 
thirty pounds for <font>Bamfield</font> himself; but that business at the     
reading was wholly declined, and absolutely 
refused by all, to act any thing in that relation, in which it was   
sent over; whereupon, Captain <font>Potter</font> 
did move, that if nothing were done in that, whether it were not     
convenient to send the Messenger 
something to bear his charges; says he, If you will pay the          
messenger Ten pounds, and send <font>Bamfield</font> 
Thirty pounds, I will give the messenger the Ten pounds; but there   
was no Agreement, nor 
Conclusion, I know of, no Bill of Exchange that was sent, but        
Captain <font>Potter</font> said, he would lay down Ten 
pounds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But no body spake against Captain <font>Potters</font>  
laying down of Ten pounds; and it was 
propounded to you to lend Ten pounds, and you said you would         
consider of it; but did <font>Potter</font> lend it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell that, my Lord, he said he would   
do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, let now Master <font>Jaquel</font> tell you    
what was the cause, why they did refuse to do any 
thing in the Letter about Five thousand pounds; what was the cause   
upon the debate between you at 
Mr. <font>Loves</font> house? why you did refuse to do any thing about the    
Five thousand pounds? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 
debate was soon over; for we absolutely refused it, we would not     
meddle in it, not liking the business; 
it was a trouble, I am confident, to them that heard it read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not remember that ever any body did     
acquaint the Magistrate with the design in 
working from <font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not some say, That <font>Bamfield</font> was a      
malignant? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, but I never 
heard of him before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you not told he was a Cavalier, and of    
the Kings side, and that that was the true 
reason, why they would not trust him? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not     
remember any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Love</font> agree for Ten pounds for      
<font>Bamfields</font> man, and Thirty pounds for <font>Bamfield</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I cannot say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not Major <font>Alford</font> tell you upon his     
return from <font>Calice</font> , that he was sent thither to take 
an account thence? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did not, but <font>William       
Drake</font> did tell me, that he was gone to <font>Calice</font> to 
speak with Captain <font>Titus</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And to take an account of the transaction at   
<font>Jersey</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly Sir, I cannot say that, 
but <font>William Drake</font> told me, he was gone thither to speak with     
<font>Titus</font> ; and this is above two years ago, 
that <font>William Drake</font> told me so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what end? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To tell and     
hear news.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he do more? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I       
profess in the presence of God, I cannot tell Sir, I 
beseech you; for in the Paper I told you before, there were some     
circumstances, and something that I 
cannot say; but it was to this purpose, To speak with <font>Titus</font> , to 
hear the news from <font>Jersey</font> , but I cannot say 
certainly that word.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We do not press you to the word, but to the    
effect of it; my Lord, I think <font>Mr. Jaquel</font> hath 
given an account already, that this relation was at <font>Mr. Loves</font>    
house. <font>Mr. Jaquel</font> , let me bring one thing 
to your remembrance, if it be true, At your meeting at <font>Mr. Loves</font> 
house, upon this business of <font>Bamfields</font> 
Narrative, you say, Thirty pounds was moved to be sent to            
<font>Bamfield</font> , and Ten pounds to his man. 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, by Captain <font>Potter</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And when it was then said, it was thought fit  
by <font>Mr. Love</font> , <font>Mr. Drake</font> , and Captain <font>Potter</font> , 
that it should be so done, whether did you not all agree it should   
be so done? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, there was 
no agreement, but it was thought convenient, or to that purpose.
<pagebreak id="44" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was thought convenient by all the company  
present? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely Sir, there 
was not much regard taken in that businesse, nor was there much      
done; for we did not stay long, 
but there were such words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But by all present? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes,    
there were such words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether were not some friends at dinner at    
<font>Dowgate</font> , and was not <font>Mason</font> there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, There was a Gentleman there, I cannot  
say, who he was, nor did I see him 
before or since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did they tell you it was? did they not 
tell you, <font>Mason</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I professe, I cannot 
remember that, nor can I tell, but I conceive it was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In your Examination, you say it was           
<font>Mason</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said, I conceived so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you believe so? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I   
cannot tell, but as I remember, <font>William Drake</font> 
told me, It was so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether when <font>Bamfields</font> letter came, and   
the letters from my Lord of <font>Argile</font> ,

<font>Baily</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor from the Generall Assembly?               
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bethink your self, you are upon your oath,    
whether he that brought letters from <font>Bamfield</font> , 
did not bring letters from <font>Baily</font> , and from the Generall         
Assembly? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: cannnot</comment> remember 
there was any such thing spoken of there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there no expression of letters of thanks  
for the good affection of the Presbyterian 
party here, and encouragement to persevere? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do   
not remember any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there no promises, that when they by      
their indeavours should get a free 
Parliament in <font>England</font> , that they would re-imburse all that was  
laid out </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaq.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do remember no such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would ask him some questions; and the first 
is, whether he hath spoken this as a meer 
relation, or whether he owns all this he hath spoken, as under an    
oath?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are past that my Lord, he did say, he was  
under an oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he say so, I am concluded. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jaquel 
made no answer to this.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have asked two questions in a few words:    
for the first, whether he speak it under 
an oath; you know, that time was spent to declare it before he       
began: If you ask of his owne 
knowledge, you mistook it; for he saith something he hath by         
relation, and some that he knows: 
this hee hath taken notice of, what should wee further examine over  
the same thing; for he saith 
some of his own knowledge, some by relation from particular parties, 
and some from parties he cals not
now to mind: and it was declared by the Court, that he was a         
witnesse, and the Court accepted him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire your Lordship to ask him this         
question, whether the supposed Narrative that 
hee speaks of, that <font>Alford</font> said he brought over, and read at my  
house, was read at my house; 
or onely by <font>Alford</font> , and so brought over as news?                
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In truth, my Lord I cannot 
tell that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He speaks of <font>Sterks</font> a <font>Scotch</font> man, I   
desire your Lordship to know wether hee knows, 
or can affirme by the oath you say he hath taken, that he was a      
<font>Scotch</font> Agent. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>No answer to 
that question.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Ask him this question, he mentions a fast 
at Major <font>Adams</font> , or Col. <font>Bartons</font> , 
and that for the good of both nations; because he thought they were  
the Church of God; whether 
there was any intimation in that meeting, that it was under this     
notion, for the good of both 
Nations; whether that meeting was for the <font>Scotch</font> Nation to       
invade the <font>English</font> Nation. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>No 
answer to <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: to to</comment> that question.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, (if I have taken him rightly, and if  
not, I desire your Notaries to inform 
me better) that Mr. <font>Love</font> did not agree to such a summe as forty  
pounds, and afterwards hee 
said, that all there said, it was convenient. Now I would ask how    
these two can agree together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are right; for the thing of agreement he    
disclaimed totally.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I did not agree to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Pres.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nor any else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M. <font>Love.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But afterwards he sayes, that they did conceive 
it was convenient; Now, I pray ask 
him, how he knew that I thought it was convenient? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jaquel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
I cannot say any thing that Mr. 
<font>Love</font> did say it was convenient; but it was not dissented from,   
nor spoken against by any, as I 
remember. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jaquel withdraws.</font> </nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At whose request did you come to the          
white Hart in <font>Breadstreet</font> , and when was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By <font>William Drake</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was that the first time you were acquainted    
with any thing of this nature, for carrying on 
and prosecuting of an order, to the furtherance of an Agreement      
between the <font>Scots</font> , and the King? 
VVhat do you know of that, at what time was the meeting?             
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Cap. <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was about two years since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat was the discourse at that meeting?       
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Cap. <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was the drawing up of some heads

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the effect of it? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cap. <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
It was to this effect, to the best of my memory; for 
it is so long since. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Here Captain</font> Far <font>was at a stand, 
whether through infirmity of speech (for he seemed to 
be slow of speech) or otherwise, I cannot say; and he or the</font>       
Attorney General <font>for him, made great use of the 
Papers of his Examination</font> .</nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What to do? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cap. <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That they might 
abate of their demands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of their former demands, that they might be    
the more like to agree; was it not so? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cap. 
<font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
<pagebreak id="47" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not propounded likewise, that some     
should be sent to the King, to perswade him to 
give satisfaction to the <font>Scots</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was           
propounded by <font>Titus</font> , but not approved of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did you not agree to send to the          
<font>Scots</font> that you did agree to, and were there not heads 
which <font>Titus</font> , or <font>Drake</font> , did undertake to write, and         
afterwards were drawn up? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw no letters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did not <font>Drake</font> tell you he had sent    
them to Master <font>Baily</font> in <font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Captain Far

not <font>William Drake</font> tell you, a letter was 
sent accordingly into <font>Scotland</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes he did tell  
me, he had sent letters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, let him give you Lordship an account 
before the Treaty at <font>Jersey</font> , where <font>Drake</font> 
met with him, and what he propounded to him, whether to send to      
<font>Jersey</font> , and what persons, and upon 
what message? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Drake</font> did say, that Captain     
<font>Titus</font> did say, It was requisite for one to be 
at the Treaty at <font>Jersey</font> , and I had it from <font>Drake</font> , that     
<font>Titus</font> did undertake to go himselfe thither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was his imployment to be there, and what 
money was to be raised for him? -- Did 
he tell you he wanted money? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After <font>Mr. Drake</font>      
desired, I would help him to ten pounds, and 
<font>Titus</font> was in want of money to relieve his necessities; and upon  
this request I did leave ten pounds 
in <font>Mr. Drakes</font> Ware-house.
