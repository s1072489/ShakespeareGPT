   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose Lodgings did you go to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lodgings of Mr. <font>Layer</font> : Mr. <font>Layer</font>    
was at home, and desir'd us to
go to the <font>Gryffin</font> Tavern in <font>Holborn</font> and he would meet us     
there; we went, and in
a little while Mr. <font>Layer</font> came to us, and then Dr. <font>Murphey</font>    
told him that I was
the Gentleman he had spoke to him of. Mr. <font>Layer</font> was glad of my   
Acquaintance,
and told me that he had had such a strong Recommendation of me, that 
he
was fully satisfyed in me; and then he held a Discourse about a      
Rising that was
to be in the Kingdom in favour of the Pretender, and that it would   
be back'd by a
great many of the Army and the Guards, and several other Gentlemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Overt Act is laid in <font>Essex</font> , and 
here is an Evidence given
of an Overt Act in <font>Middlesex</font> ; with Submission they can give no  
Evidence of an
Overt Act in another County, till they give Evidence of an Overt Act 
in <font>Essex</font> ,
where the Indictment is laid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All they say of Matters in the County of   
<font>Middlesex</font> , unless they
give Evidence of Overt Acts in the County of <font>Essex</font> , it          
signifies nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, with Submission they ought not  
to be suffer'd to
give Evidence of any Overt Act in <font>Middlesex</font> , before they give   
Evidence of some
Overt Act in <font>Essex</font> ; for the proving some Overt Act in <font>Essex</font> 
is the only Thing
which can entitle them to prove any Overt Act elsewhere. For by the  
Method
they would go on in, the Jury may be captivated with a Story of the  
<font>Gryffin</font>
Tavern, and of Mr. <font>Layer's</font> other Assignations and Actions in     
<font>Middlesex</font> , which
cannot be imputed to him upon this Indictment until some Treason be  
proved in <font>Essex</font> :
I hope therefore the King's Counsel shall receive your Lordship's    
Directions to go
on regularly, to begin to give an Account of the Overt Acts in       
<font>Essex</font> , before they
go into another County.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Hungerford</font> , you must give them    
leave to go on in their own
Method, of that that first happen'd in <font>Middlesex</font> , and           
afterwards of what
happen'd in <font>Essex</font> ; and if you dare not trust them and us, but   
will have your own
Method, it would be to put us into Confusion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we insist upon it in point of    
Law, that we are intitled
to give Evidence of Overt Acts of the same Species of Treason laid   
in the
Indictment, though done in any County in <font>England</font> , provided we   
also prove an Overt
Act in the County of <font>Essex</font> ; which we must do, otherwise this    
will pass for 
nothing. Mr <font>Lynch</font> , go on, and give my Lord and the Jury an      
Account of what
Mr. <font>Layer</font> said, when you were together at the <font>Griffin</font> Tavern.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The first thing he told me was, that he was very 
glad to meet me, that
he had had a good Recommendation of me from Dr. <font>Murphey</font> , as     
being a Man he
could confide in; and beginning his Discourse of an Insurrection in  
the Kingdom,
he told me, that they were back'd with a great many of the Army and  
the Guards,
that there was a great many of the Nobility and Gentry of the        
Country that
would come in to 'em: He told me then, that he wanted a Man of       
Resolution that
would take upon him the seizing of some Person of Note, as a         
General, or some
other great Man. The Discourse run all upon the same thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Recollect as well as you can, the         
Particulars Mr. <font>Layer</font> told you
relating to this Design.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me the general Design of the Revolution  
in the Kingdom, in
favour of the Pretender, and that they were back'd by a great many   
of the Army,
and a great many of the Nobility and Gentry; and then he told me he  
wanted a
Man of Resolution, to undertake with some others, to seize a great   
Man, as a
General or some other great Man: At that Time I took upon my self to 
do it, so
at that time we discours'd no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long were you together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About half an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When had you the next Meeting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Day or two afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what Place?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the same Tavern, the <font>Griffin</font> Tavern; when 
I came there I sent a
Boy for Mr. <font>Layer</font> , as he had ordered me to do when I wanted to  
see him.
<pagebreak id="48" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was your first Meeting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About the Month of <font>June</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And the 2=d= Meeting was two or three Days 
after the first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At your parting after the first      
Meeting, what did Mr. <font>Layer</font>
say to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Layer</font> told me, if I had occasion to      
speak to him that I shou'd not
come to his Lodgings, but go to a Tavern and send for him, which I   
did; I sent
a Boy for him, and he came to me. Then talking over a Glass of Wine, 
he
told me that he had pitched upon me to seize the Earl of             
<font>Cadogan</font> , and that I
shou'd chuse as many Persons as I thought fit who wou'd answer the   
same
Design; and he being the principal Man in the Army, it wou'd         
discourage the
King's Party, and animate the Pretender's Party; which as I said     
before, I agreed
to undertake, and to do the utmost of my Endeavours to do it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you to do it alone, or was you   
to have any
Assistance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I was to have Assistance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Assistance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such that I shou'd chuse, such People that I     
cou'd confide in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you undertake it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did undertake it, and to pitch upon such  
Persons as shou'd be
proper to assist me in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was any thing said at that time relating  
to any Person, who
was to have the Conduct of the Design?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me that there was some great Man that    
did not want Wit,
Courage or Resolution, and was at the head of this Affair, who wou'd 
at a proper
time give me an Order to effect something further about it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any more Discourse with the       
Prisoner about this
Affair?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, we had several Discourses about it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell my Lord and the Jury what more        
Discourse you had, if
you can remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The chief Part I was to act was to seize the     
Earl of <font>Cadogan</font> , with such
Gentlemen as I should think proper to answer the end of seizing him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any other Meeting, and     
when and how long
after?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After that I came to a Tavern in <font>Holbourn</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long after?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some few Days; it was at the <font>Castle</font> Tavern   
in <font>Holbourn</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att.Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was with you at that Tavern?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I came to the Tavern and sent for Mr. <font>Layer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he come to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he came to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Discourse had you with him at that    
time? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We had no particular Discourse, but in general   
we talk'd about the
Uneasiness of the Nation, and the fair Opportunity there was to rise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray give an Account of what else pass'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say, the same Discourse that we had had at two 
Meetings before, he
repeated, and said, now is a fair Opportunity, the Uneasiness of the 
People being
such, to bring about a Revolution, since they would be back'd by the 
Army and
the Guards, and several other People. Soon after that we parted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When had you any other Meeting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some Meetings we had at Mr. <font>Layer's</font> House in 
<font>Southampton-Buildings</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long after?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A few Days only.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the several Meetings at his       
House, what was the Subject
of your Discourse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was always upon the same, about the Rising    
and Uneasiness of the
People, and the fair Opportunity of bringing about a Revolution, of  
the
Disposition of the Army and the Guards.
<pagebreak id="49" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he give you any Encouragement?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After I met him at his House in                  
<font>Southampton-buildings</font> , I told him of
my Uneasiness, because he had told me at the beginning, that these   
Things would
be soon put in Execution: I told him, if they were delayed, I was    
afraid they
wou'd not succeed. He then animated me, by telling me that there was 
no fear
of its succeeding; and that I should not be discouraged, for there   
was a Great
Man, a Man of Wit and Conduct, that was at the Helm, and that had the
Management of the Scheme: That I should always keep a good Heart;    
and that
Things went on very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you in whose Favour this was to be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; in Favour of the Pretender. He mentioned    
him by the Name
of King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing about his      
going into the
Country?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After I met him at his House, he went into the   
Country, and staid
sixteen or seventeen Days; at his Return, I went to see him, and     
expressing how
uneasy I was about the Delay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About what Time was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was in <font>July</font> . And then I told   
him again how uneasy I was
at the Delay. To which he answer'd, Keep a good Heart, all Things go 
on
very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any Apprehensions that all   
was to be done at
home, or that you was to have any foreign Assistance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In my Discourse to him of the Uneasiness I was   
under at the Delay,
I asked him if he had any Promise of any Succour from any Power      
Abroad? He
told me, if we once made a Beginning, we should not want them: But   
did
insinuate, that we should not want Encouragement from the Court of   
<font>France</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you expressed your Uneasiness at the  
Delay, what did
he say to encourage you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The reason he told me was, that Things went on   
very well, and would
very soon be put in Execution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what manner did you express your        
Uneasiness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing but that I was uneasy, and I was afraid  
that Things did go
wrong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you say, did you say any thing   
relating to your own
Circumstances?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Beginning I told Dr. <font>Murphey</font> ,        
because it would be a long
while, some five or six Weeks, before I was to be introduced to Mr.  
<font>Layer's</font>
Company, that I came on my own particular Business, and my           
Circumstances
would not permit me to be long here at my own Expence. At the        
meeting with
Mr. <font>Layer</font> , when I first made this Complaint to him, Mr.         
<font>Layer</font> told me I should
not want for a small Matter, to maintain me in <font>England</font> .         
Accordingly Mr. <font>Layer</font>
gave me some Money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember how much that was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he give you Money at any other Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Layer</font> gave me some Money the first Time, 
and afterwards he sent
me some Money by Dr. <font>Murphey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he give you any Money at any     
other Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, the last Time I was with him I had more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Times had you Money of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Five or six Times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know what the Sums did amount to    
together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't recollect; but I believe about eight or  
ten Guineas.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was it given you for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To keep me in <font>England</font> , and to assist in the 
intended Design of a
Revolution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After you went to him, upon his      
Return out of the 
Country, do you remember the Discourse that pass'd between you then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: After I came to his House, I expressed my   
Uneasiness at the
Delay: Upon which he encouraged me, giving me to hope that Things    
went on
very well, and our Design would effectually take Place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ask him any thing about the  
Army?
<pagebreak id="50" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I asked him if he had any Encouragement from the 
Guards and the
Army? He told me, Yes, he had; that a great many of the Officers     
would not
engage themselves now, being well paid; but he said he had spoke     
with several
Officers of the Guards, who had assured him, that most of the common 
Soldiers
would come in, as soon as we made a Beginning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he mention any thing of the Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you asked him if he had any          
Encouragement from the
Army, what did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me, That he had Encouragement from a     
great many of the
Officers of the Army: That he had discoursed with several Serjeants  
of the
Guards, who told him that the common Soldiers would be glad, after   
they had
made a Beginning, to come in to 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he give you any Reason for this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Layer</font> told me, the Serjeants told him so 
before they were
encamped, and complained of their ill Usage, and hard Usage from the 
subaltern
Officers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you acquainted with any Time, or 
Day that was
fixed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no fix'd Time: Mr. <font>Layer</font> told me,  
it was to be on the
rising of the Camp; because they could not talk with the Soldiers so 
well, while
they were encamped, as they could afterwards, when they were in their
Quarters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Consultation of        
viewing any one's House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Afterwards, in Discourse he told me, that it was 
fit to go and view
the Earl of <font>Cadogan's</font> House; in case it was necessary to seize   
the said Lord in his
House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is his House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Pickadilly</font> . Accordingly we appointed a   
Day to go; and I came
to his Lodgings, and we took Coach, and away we went; and talking to 
him
about it, he told me, he was very well acquainted with my Lord       
<font>Cadogan</font> , and
had some Business with him, about an estate which his Lordship was   
about buying:
We went to his House, but my Lord was not to be spoke with, or was   
not within, I
don't remember which, but we were conducted into his House; we       
view'd the
inner Part of the House, afterwards we went into the Garden, we      
viewed the
lower Part of the Garden, then we went out in the Yard, and took a   
View of
the Avenues round about the House. I don't remember exactly the      
Time, but
it was that Day that a Soldier should have been shot in              
<font>Hyde-Park</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any Discourse about the      
Feasibleness of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, that it was easy to be done; if we had but  
some resolute
Gentlemen to stand by us, that it was very feasible to be done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any Talk at that Time        
relating to the <font>Tower</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me, the <font>Tower</font> would be immediately   
surrender'd to the Party;
on the Day the Plot was to be put in Execution, a certain Officer of 
the Guards
would take upon him to mount the Guards there, who would facilitate  
the
Delivery of the <font>Tower</font> to them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Talk of the Mint?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, afterwards: He said there would be no doubt 
of the Mint; they
would be glad to take the Opportunity to shake off their             
Confinement: And that
they would put Arms into their Hands, according as they repaired to  
their 
Party.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you see the Prisoner next after   
the Time that you
speak of, of viewing my Lord <font>Cadogan's</font> House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him at his own House, and at several       
Taverns in the City; and
once he wrote to me, desiring me to come to his Lodging;             
accordingly I went,
and when I came to his House, I met with a little Paper that was     
left for me,
directing me to go to the <font>Queen's-head</font> Tavern in                 
<font>Great Queen's-street</font> , near
<font>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</font> , and to enquire there for one Mr.          
<font>Wilson</font> ; which I did, and I
was conducted into a Room where they said Mr. <font>Wilson</font> was, with   
Mr. <font>Layer</font> ,
and another Man, who seem'd, by his Clothes, to be a Serjeant of the 
Guards.
I do not know the Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What pass'd then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We staid a little while there, we talk'd over    
the Business, and drank
good Success to the Enterprize.
<pagebreak id="51" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Lordship will please to take    
notice, That when he
went to Mr. <font>Layer's</font> Lodging, he found a Letter there, directing  
him to go to the
<font>Queen's-Head-Tavern</font> , and enquire for one <font>Wilson</font> ; that when 
he came there,
<font>Wilson</font> was there, and Mr. <font>Layer</font> and another Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What passed at that Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing material.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You talk'd about drinking good Success to  
the Enterprize:
Who drank that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We all drank that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Prisoner at the Bar drink it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he did. I told the Prisoner, when he went   
out, that I was
mighty uneasy at the Delay of this Affair. He told me, I need not be 
uneasy, for
every Thing went on well; and they had a Nobleman at the Helm, who had
Authority from the Pretender, and would lose no Opportunity when a   
fit Time
offered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he call the Pretender?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He called him the King. I was uneasy at the      
Delay, for fear of being
discover'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Reason did he give you, why you      
should not be
uneasy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because their Designs were quickly to be put in  
Execution; and there
was a Nobleman at the Helm who would put the Design in Execution, as
having full Power and Authority from the King to act as he thought   
proper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ask who that Nobleman was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; but he never told me his Name, but said,    
that I should, in a
proper Time, be presented to him, and receive my Commission and      
Orders from him
to seize my Lord <font>Cadogan</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we shall now gratify the    
Prisoner's Counsel,
with an Account of what happened in <font>Essex</font> ; I hope they will not 
be impatient
to hear that: Therefore, pray acquaint my Lord, and the Jury, when   
you went
out of Town with Mr. <font>Layer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was at Mr. <font>Layer's</font> House the Day  
when the Bishop of
<font>Rochester</font> was sent to the <font>Tower</font> ; he ask'd me, if I would    
ride abroad with him
the next Day to take the Air; I consented to it, and came the next   
Morning to
his House; and Mr. <font>Layer</font> asked me, if I mounted with Furniture:  
I told him
no; but that I had a double Barrel Fowling-piece, which if his       
Servant would
carry, would do as well. He then desired me to go and stay for him   
without
<font>Aldgate</font> , and get my Gun ready loaden, for he had that about him 
which he would
not lose for any thing in the World. I went and staid till about ten 
or eleven a
Clock, when Mr. <font>Layer</font> met me, and gave the Gun to his Servant to 
carry. On
the Road he told me, we were going to my Lord <font>North</font> and          
<font>Gray's</font> , whom he was
very well acquainted with, and that he would recommend me to him as  
a Friend
of his. When we got to the <font>Green Man</font> , he told me, we had better 
go in and
dine there, because Dinner-time would be over before we could get to 
my Lord
<font>North</font> and <font>Gray's</font> . Whilst Dinner was getting ready, we had   
several Discourses
on the same Subject, of the Uneasiness of the Nation, and its        
Inclination to a
Revolution, and how to bring it about; upon which, he pulled a Paper 
out of
his Pocket, and gave it me to read the latter Part of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you remember what it contained?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember some Lines of it; which was, in       
general, to invite the
Nation to an Insurrection, and to shake off the Calamities and       
Miseries they
endured under the present Ministry. And it was mentioned in the said 
Paper, that
the Earl of <font>Cadogan</font> was actually in their Custody; thereby       
encouraging the Army
to revolt, with an Offer of three Guineas to every Horseman and      
Serjeant, and
two Guineas to every Corporal, and one Guinea to every common        
Soldier, to be
paid immediately on their joining the Party, and a Promise of farther
Preferment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you read this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did, out of the Paper in Mr. <font>Layer's</font> Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know whose Hand-writing it was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> According to our Discourse, I thought it might   
be his writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But he produced it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, he produced it.
<pagebreak id="52" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you imagine, from some Discourse  
between you, that it
was his Hand-writing; what Reason was there, in all his Discourse,   
that
induced you to think so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He talk'd of it as being of his own making;      
besides, there were several
Interliniations, Dashings-out, and Interliniations afterwards. He    
was very well
satisfied and easy as to me, and said, he could wish that he could   
bring Matters about
so, as that I could have the sole Direction of seizing some of the   
Ministry, and
namely, my Lord <font>Townshend</font> , my Lord <font>Carterett</font> , and Mr.      
<font>Walpole</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Discourse about seizing the  
King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, when the Design was put in Execution,   
the Army would
declare in their Favour, and they would send a strong Guard to take  
care of the
King's Person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How to take care of the King's Person?     
What was you to do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing but to secure the King's Person; by what 
he told me, it was
for the Publick Good of the Kingdom; that they did not mean, nor had 
they
any Design on the King's Person, but only to keep him in Security    
from any
Insult.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What more passed at that Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing more in particular.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any talk relating to the Army?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said before what related to the Army.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Discourse about a      
Scheme or Plan?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me there was a Scheme laid on that Foot, 
of which I told you
the first Step was to seize the Earl of <font>Cadogan</font> , and then,      
according as the Army
came over, to take care and seize the King's Person; and he thought  
the proper
Time to put this in Execution, would be at the Rising of the Camp in
<font>Hyde-Park</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any Objection made to this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I made no Objection, only shew'd my          
Uneasiness at the long
Delay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you so express'd your           
Uneasiness, what did he say? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me, if I could think or propose any      
Thing more proper, that
I should do it. After that we rode toward <font>Epping</font> , and went to   
my Lord <font>North</font> and
<font>Gray's</font> ; and there Mr. <font>Layer</font> introduced me as his Friend. We 
staid there all
Night, and dined there the next Day. In the Evening we came away in
Company with another Gentleman that I did not know; but we talk'd on 
the Road about
the Situation of my Lord's House; and Mr. <font>Layer</font> told me, he had
recommended me to his Lordship, as his particular Friend, and ask'd  
me how I liked him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he ask you any Questions? Do you 
remember what he
called his Lordship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember any other Name but <font>My Lord</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When he ask'd your Opinion of him,   
and how you liked
him, did he describe him in any other manner, or only called him     
<font>My Lord</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He only called him my Lord <font>North</font> and         
<font>Gray</font> ; he only ask'd me how I
liked my Lord <font>North</font> and <font>Gray</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Pengelly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Liked his Lordship, for what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Reeve.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any Talk with him about the Person    
that was to have the
chief Command?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; but he never named the Person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you never any Discourse who was to command 
the Party that
was to seize my Lord <font>Cadogan</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was to command that Party.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you any other time at my Lord <font>North</font>    
and <font>Gray's</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; another time I went to my Lord <font>North</font>    
and <font>Gray's</font> , where I found
Mr. <font>Layer</font> , and express'd to Mr. <font>Layer</font> the Uneasiness I was  
in at the long Delay,
and that I was afraid our Hopes would vanish; and told him, if       
things were not
soon put in Execution, I would withdraw myself. Mr. <font>Layer</font> bid me 
not be
uneasy, Things might perhaps be sooner put in Execution than I       
imagined.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  Where was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Epping</font> , at my Lord <font>North</font> and         
<font>Gray's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>West.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you come home together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I came home that Night: Mr. <font>Layer</font>        
remained there.

    <sample id="SAMPLE 2">

<pagebreak id="54" />
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know whether your Lordship will    
indulge us to ask the
Witness a Question or two now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Propose your Questions, and we will tell you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether he hath any Offer of Pardon        
propos'd to him to induce
him to give Evidence against the Prisoner at the Bar; which if he    
hath, we
apprehend will invalidate his Evidence
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir; I have no Promise of Pardon at all: I   
only do this out of
Justice, to make what Reparation I can, and to save the Blood of many
People.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg Leave to ask him a few more          
Questions. I think you say
the first time you were introduced into this Gentleman's Company,    
the Prisoner
at the Bar was at the <font>Griffin-Tavern</font> in <font>Holborn</font> , and that   
he then told you he had
great Designs in hand; and that there was an Insurrection design'd,  
and they
wanted a Person of Resolution to seize a General: This, you say, was 
the first
Time that ever you saw the Prisoner at the Bar. How came you to have 
that
Share of Confidence in a Man that you never saw before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told you I was in Discourse with Dr.           
<font>Murphey</font> a great many Days and
Weeks before I saw Mr. <font>Layer</font> ; I told you how every Day I saw    
him, and always
discours'd about the Insurrection, and how he told me then that he   
would
recommend me to a Man that had the Management of the greatest Part   
in this
Affair; and I ask'd every Day when I should be introduced to him: He 
told me,
the Time was not come yet; but when it was a proper time, he would   
introduce
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you give that for a Reason, why    
you had that 
Confidence in him, because you had been recommended by one Dr.       
<font>Murphey</font> . How
came you to have that mighty Dependance on Dr. <font>Murphey</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because Dr. <font>Murphey</font> and I had been           
acquainted several Years ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you was not in any wicked Design    
with Dr. <font>Murphey</font> ,
and so much acquainted, as to recommend you in a Case of Treason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a common Friendship between us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came he to trust you? Would you have   
trusted him in a
Business of Treason?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have been concerned in Affairs together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was you at the <font>Green Man</font> with 
Mr. <font>Layer</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say exactly the Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't ask you exactly to a Minute or     
two; but was you there
an Hour, or two, or three Hours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say whether we were there an Hour or     
two; but we had
something dress'd for Dinner, and the Matter was discours'd of by us 
before
Dinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you first alighted from your Horses,  
what Room was
you shewn into?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were shewn into a Room up one Pair of Stairs  
on the right-hand,
the first Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it towards the Street, or backwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It look'd into the common Road.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you look out of the Window and see a   
Person of your
Acquaintance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw two Gentlemen, but did not know them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you look out of the Window, and    
say, you saw a
Gentleman of your Acquaintance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I said I saw two Gentlemen that I thought I had  
seen before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you go down to those Gentlemen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I did not go down to them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you go down to them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. 
<pagebreak id="55" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you say so to Mr. <font>Layer</font> , in   
the Drawer's Presence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you tell me that those Gentlemen were 
your Acquaintance?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told you, those two Gentlemen I had seen before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long were we together at the 
<font>Green-Man</font> ? Were the Horses
put up, or not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any thing dress'd for our Dinner    
but a Beef-stake?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nothing else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you go down Stairs, pretending you    
went to those
Gentlemen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not tell you I went to those Gentlemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not go down Stairs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did; and came up again immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not Dinner on Table when you came up again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went down twice before Dinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you must consequently leave me in the    
Room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went down to make Water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you go down the second time for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out of Curiosity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did you stay?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not both times above two Minutes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was then alone, when you went down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this Discourse before or after Dinner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was before Dinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you came up the second Time, was not     
Dinner on the 
Table?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was come up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet the Discourse we had was before Dinner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was before Dinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much Time might we spend before Dinner,   
half an Hour, or
an Hour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember; but it was a good while.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not the double Barrel Gun in the Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know whether it was there, or whether    
your Servant had it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Time of Dinner, was my Servant, or     
Drawer, in the
Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neither of them was in the Room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say we were a good while, you and I,      
alone; pray, how
long?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say positively how long.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any Copy of that Part of the    
Paper he gave you
to read, and which you read?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Whole of it of any Length?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the best of my Remembrance, it was a common   
Sheet of Paper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you read the Whole?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: He doubled it down, and gave me the latter   
Part of it to read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some Things you seem to remember, and some 
Things you don't
remember: Was it printed, or written?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was written.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he not mention it to be the Prince of  
<font>Orange's</font>
Declaration?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not the Paper blotted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lynch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In that I saw there were two or three Places     
interlined.  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I think the Gentlemen did say   
they had not done
with their Evidence, with relation to an Overt-Act in <font>Essex</font> ; if 
they have not,
they will do well to go on now: But we hope they shall not go into   
Overt-Acts
committed in any other County, till they make the whole of their     
Proofs of an
Overt-Act in <font>Essex</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have been told, they should proceed in  
their own Method,
<pagebreak id="56" />
and when they have done, you may make what Observations may be of    
Service to
your Client.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Relations of Fact arising in another     
County, which have no
Relation to the Fact arising in <font>Essex</font> , we hope they shall not   
go into, to amuse
or captivate the Jury, the Court, and the Auditory.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sure never any Thing was like this! It is  
our Province to give
Directions, and we think it not proper to interrupt the King's       
Counsel, but that
they should proceed in their own Method: You shall be heard as long  
as you
please, when you come to make your Observations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Prisoner hath a Right to say any      
thing that is proper, to
the Court and the Jury, in his Defence, but he must say it openly;   
he is not to
talk privately with the Jury; though I am sure they are Gentlemen    
of so great
Worth and Honour, as not to be influenced.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare say the Jury won't be influenced;   
but he talks to his
Counsel so loud, that the Jury may easily hear every Word he says.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He must not speak so loud.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I just now heard him say, It was strange   
to go on with
Evidence that would not be to the Purpose. I heard him, as I sate    
here; let him
deny it if he can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you will not offer any thing of that 
Kind, Mr. <font>Layer</font> :
You have a Right to discourse with your Counsel, but you must do it  
in such a
Manner as the Jury may not hear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, my Lord, he shall have no             
Encouragement from us
for any such Conduct.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Matthew Plunkett</font> sworn.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell my Lord and the Jury, whether   
you know the
Prisoner at the Bar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do know him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you tell my Lord and the Jury,  
upon what Account,
and by whose Means, you first became acquainted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Major <font>Barnewell</font> brought me first      
acquainted with Mr. <font>Layer</font> ;
he had an Execution in his House in <font>Great Queen's-street</font> , and   
this Major <font>Barnewell</font>
came to me, and desired me to get a Couple of Grenadiers. I brought  
him two;
we went to Mr. <font>Layer's</font> House, and his Clerk let us in at the     
Back-door, and the
Grenadiers turned the Officers out, and Mr. <font>Layer</font> gave them a    
Crown, and a
Glass of Brandy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As near as I can guess, it is going on of     
five Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell my Lord and the Jury, what      
Month in this last
Year you renewed the Acquaintance, and who brought you to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The next Acquaintance I had afterwards, was   
by Major <font>Barnewell</font> ,
who was arrested, and he sent me with a Letter to his House, to      
desire him to
relieve him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of one <font>James 
Plunkett</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: He came to me from Mr. <font>Layer</font> , in    
<font>July</font> last, to desire me to
meet him; but how this Counsellor <font>Layer</font> and this <font>James         
Plunkett</font> came
acquainted I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know what he is; he is acquainted     
with Mr. <font>Layer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Profession is he of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know; nor how he lives, or gets his   
Bread.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Layer</font> paid the Charges for Major      
<font>Barnewell</font> , and brought him
out of the <font>Marshalsea</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Reeve.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was this ago?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the best of my Knowledge, four Years ago.

do great
Matters for me; and what I suffer'd in the Army, he would make me    
Amends for.

eight or nine Upstarts that belong'd to King <font>George's</font> Court;

take our Rights and
Liberties from us: You will keep a <font>Dutch</font> Army, and it will be to 
make a War

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What would he have to cure all this?

over from <font>Ireland</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, you say, Five Years afterwards I met    
you in

and gave you Half-a-Crown to drink. I told you my Lord <font>North</font> and
<font>Grey</font> was to be General: That my Lord <font>Strafford</font> was concern'd 
in it.  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; you told me they were Promoters of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Promoters of what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of this Conspiracy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So you did not know me; nor I did not know you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, you knew me; therefore, Sir, said I, you 
have an Advantage
against me; for I don't know you. Afterwards we met one another by

this; and desire  
me to lend you 13 <font>s.</font> upon Account of being Bail in an Action in  
the <font>Marshal's</font>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was Two Months after: There was a        
Soldier which was
arrested by a <font>Marshal's-Court</font> Writ. 
<comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR Court IN SOURCE TEXT.</comment>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, you did.

Kindness in the World

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never ask'd you in the Course of my Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never borrow any Money of me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I never borrowed any Money of you,        
otherwise that to get
Men lifted for the Pretender.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall shew that you are a little mistaken   
by and by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said, you was decoy'd to Church?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Decoy'd! I said it was out of my Way, when my 
own Parish
Church was nearer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, do you use to go to Church?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.

<font>James Plunkett</font> , he came
to you when your Wife was in the Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The first Time I saw him, was, when Mr.       
<font>Layer</font> releas'd Major
<font>Barnewell</font> out of the <font>Marshalsea</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When <font>James Plunkett</font> came to your

Arm, and told you, he came from Mr. <font>Layer</font> ; Did he tell you that 
first Time,
he came from Mr. <font>Layer</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Oath he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Discourse had you the first Time? Did 
he only ask you
to go and meet Mr. <font>Layer</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He came to me, and desired me to meet Mr.     
<font>Layer</font> at the <font>Italian</font>
Coffee-House in <font>Russel-Court</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>James Plunkett</font> talk to you about   
lifting Men for the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; he only was sent on an Errand from Mr.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then you came to the Nonjuring Parson: 
The Unjuring
Parson, as you call him. What Discourse had you with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same Discourse pass'd between us about    
lifting Men.
<pagebreak id="62" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, the first Time you saw <font>James       
Plunkett</font> , and the first
Time you saw the Nonjuring Parson?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because he came from Mr. <font>Layer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So you trusted both of 'em at first Sight, 
and talked to 'em
about lifting Men for the Pretender.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, both talked to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many times had this Unjuring Parson    
been with you,
before you knew his Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He had been with me two or three times; he    
told me his Name was
<font>Jeffreys</font> , but did not tell me his Christian Name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you his Name was <font>Jeffreys</font>

the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long ago was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe about ten Months ago: I mean ten    
Weeks ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wou'd not surprize you; I wou'd have you 
consider you are
upon your Oath: Is it ten Months, or ten Weeks?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ten Weeks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How come you to remember the Contents of   
the Letter so
exactly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard it repeated over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray repeat it over again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Plunkett</font> , Mr. <font>Layer</font> is come to

Letter was lost?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I miss'd it about two Months ago, or more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two Months ago, or more. How long was      
it after you receiv'd
it that you miss'd it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I kept the Letter in my Pocket some time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe I had it three Weeks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So that 'tis ten Weeks since you receiv'd  
this Letter, two Months
since you lost it; you kept it in your Pocket three Weeks: You can   
read
Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I cannot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, not read Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can you be so particular as to the     
Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard it read often enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who read it to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Child</font> read it over to me two or      
three times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, this is mere Romance, that at twice   
hearing it read, you
can remember it, the very Words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can remember those Words, to the best of my 
Knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can he tell, when he cannot read at  
all? There is
nothing in it. If one was to ask him, whether can you recite the     
Articles of the
Creed, I believe he cou'd not do it; and yet is so exact in          
repeating the Words of
this Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Countryman are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Plunkett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An <font>Irishman</font> : You knew that long ago; you

and in four or five Days time he brought them to me again: He took   
them away,
and brought them to me again, and told me they were a few            
Love-Letters; and
begg'd of me not to let Mrs. <font>Cook</font> know it, for she would make a  
Disturbance,
and tell his Wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When had you the lesser Bundle?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had that some time after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Directions had you with the     
little Bundle?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He desired me to take the same Care of that, 
as of the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was that seal'd up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were both seal'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did you put them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I put them into my Trunk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After this; you know when the        
Messengers came?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before that, he came one Day in the          
Afternoon to our House,
and ask'd where I was. It was the Beginning of                       
<font>Bartholomew-tide</font> . I was not at
home: He left a Message for me, that I shou'd bring those Writings   
home. I
carry'd them home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Home! what do you mean by home?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Layer's</font> own House: He left word,     
that he wou'd be at home
by Eight a-Clock that Night. I was there about Eight a-Clock: I      
asked the
Maid where he was? She said he was in the Back-Parlour. I asked her  
if any
body was with him? She said there were two Gentlemen. Said I, Tell   
your
Master that I am here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, the great Bundle was taken from  
you again, and
afterwards he brought the lesser Bundle; and after this you receiv'd 
a Message, or
Intimation, that you shou'd bring home that Bundle?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I had Two Bundles. He left word,    
that I should
bring his Papers Home; for he stay'd at Home till Eight-a-Clock that 
Night. I
went to his House: And when I knock'd at the Door, the Maid came to  
the Door.
I ask'd her, if her Master was within? she told me, Yes; he was in   
the back
<pagebreak id="66" />
Parlour; and that there was a Gentleman or Two with him. I desir'd   
her to go
and tell her Master that I was there. And he came out to me; and I   
gave him
the Writings; and he desired me to come again the next Morning; which
was on a <font>Saturday</font> , about Eleven-a-Clock, for he was going out of
Town: And that I would come and take those Writings again. Which
accordingly I did. It was in the Morning, at the Time that the Bell  
was ringing
at <font>Lincolns-Inn</font> Chapel, when I went to him, and he deliver'd me  
the Papers again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you recollect the Day that he left    
Word for you to come
to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was the Beginning of <font>Bartholomew-tide</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Day of the Week was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was on a <font>Friday</font> Night that I went and 
carried them to his House.    
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And when was it that he desired you would 
come and call for
them again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was the next Morning at Eleven-a-Clock,   
or near the Matter,
that I went to his House; and he gave me the Writings again, and     
charged me
to take Care of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was you to do with them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To take care of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you meddle with them, or open    
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir; I put them in my Trunk: They lay    
there all the time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they there when the Officers    
came?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you there when the Bundles were  
opened?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you mark the Papers your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look upon the Papers, and see if you 
find your Mark on
those Papers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, this is my Mark.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Speare</font> , you was present at  
the opening of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Speare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was. They were sealed up when I opened them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you put your Name on them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Speare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did put my Name on them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they out of your Custody before 
you put your Name
on them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Speare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; they were not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Cheshyre.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Turner</font> put his Name to   
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Speare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He put his Name to them, before ever they    
were out of my Custody.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have mark'd all those Papers. You are  
sure those are the
Papers you took out of the Trunk in Mrs. <font>Mason's</font> Lodging?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Speare.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure they are.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shew them to Mrs. <font>Mason</font> . Mrs.         
<font>Mason</font> , were those Papers in
the Bundles that were deliver'd to you by Mr. <font>Layer</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir; they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have mark'd those Papers, have you not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said, you gave the Bundles back to    
Mr. <font>Layer</font> on a <font>Friday</font> ,   
about the Beginning of <font>Bartholomew-tide</font> . Do you remember        
whether it was
upon <font>Bartholomew-Day</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR Day IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> or not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did Mr. <font>Layer</font> say, when you      
brought them to him again?   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He only thank'd me; and desired me to come   
the next Day and
take them from him again: Which I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he mention then, that he was going    
out of Town?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: And it was about Eleven-a-Clock on a    
<font>Saturday</font> Morning
that I went to him, and he deliver'd the Papers to me again. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you write?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you made the same Mark on all those 
Papers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was so frightned at that time, that I      
hardly knew what Mark I made.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you was frightned at that time, and   
did not know what
Mark you made, how can you be sure you know your Mark again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I can tell it very well.
<pagebreak id="67" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you say you was so frighted you did 
not know what
Mark you made?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, sure I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Oath you have taken, hath any   
Body seen those
Papers before they were taken by the Messengers; whether Sir <font>John  
Meeres</font> , or
his Man <font>Thomas</font> hath seen them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor his Man <font>Thomas</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nor his Man <font>Thomas</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you, Can you write or can you read   
Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told you I can't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You only can make your Mark?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you only make but one Mark, or use      
several Marks?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I make but one Mark.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray make the Mark you generally use? With 
Submission, my
Lord, I desire she may have a Pen and Ink to see if she can make the 
same Mark
again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely we are regular in desiring that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What you desire is proper. She says she   
knows them to be the
same Papers, because she hath set her Mark upon them; they doubt     
whether she
may mistake in her Mark, and desire she may make her Mark again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we desire that she may make her   
Mark again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We desire she may have a convenient Place 
to do it in, and
that she may sit down while she writes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I can do it without. </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>A Pen and    
Ink and Paper is given to her, 
and she sets her Mark an</font> E <font>and an</font> M.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here are the Letters <font>E</font> and <font>M</font> set  
to the Papers produc'd; and
tho' in this Confusion she should not make her Letters exactly like  
those, yet I
apprehend that would weigh very little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I can't tell what they mean; this 
doth not
depend --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire to go on with our        
Questions. <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Question.s</comment> I ask you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> ( <font>Having compared the Letters made   
by Mrs.</font> Mason <font>in Court, with
those on the Papers</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Character which she now writes is     
like what she writ on
those Papers, and so confirms her Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the delivery of those Bundles to you 
by Mr. <font>Layer</font> , I ask
you whether Sir <font>John Meeres's</font> Man <font>Thomas</font> ever saw those      
Bundles open'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he never was up in my Room; there was no 
such
Familiarity between us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did one <font>Wilson</font> ever see them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did ever you produce them to one <font>Binks</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No? Nor did Sir <font>John Meeres's</font> Man         
<font>Thomas</font> never see them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never upon my Oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever produce them sealed up? Did   
you ever let <font>Thomas</font>
or <font>William</font> , <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS TWO COMMAS</comment> or Sir               
<font>John Meeres</font> himself see either of those Bundles as they were
sealed up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they were in my Trunk: I always kept     
them in my
Trunk; perhaps as I open'd my Trunk, they might see them lie in my   
Trunk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know one Mrs. <font>Buda</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. I don't know the Name. I don't know one  
Mrs. <font>Buda</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know one Mrs. <font>Herbert</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know many of that Name.
   [</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever go by that Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever go by the Name of <font>Corbet</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever go by the Name of <font>Bevan</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never did go by the Name of <font>Bevan</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Ketelbey</font> , I don't know what the  
Meaning of this
Examination is; when it appears beyond Contradiction, that this      
Woman was an
Acquaintance of your Client's.
<pagebreak id="68" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if we prove her to be an ill      
Woman, I hope it will
take off her Credit so that her Evidence will not weigh with your    
Lordship, or
the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Time when these Bundles were       
seized, had they
Mr. <font>Layer's</font> Seal upon them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. The Seal of Mr. <font>Layer</font> was upon them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What says the Messenger? At the Time that 
you seized these Two
Bundles of Papers, was there any Seal upon them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Messenger.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were Three Seals upon one, and some    
Seals upon the other;
the Seal was something of a small Head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is Mr. <font>Layer's</font> Seal?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Something of a Head, but I can't tell what   
Head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know Mr. <font>Layer's</font> Seal?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. It is something of a Head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it the Representation of a Man's Head, 
or the Head of
a Beast?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a Head, with something of a Ruff about 
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Mason</font> , look upon the Head. Is    
that Head the Seal of
Mr. <font>Layer</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. Upon my Oath it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Jus.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What says the Messenger. Was that Seal of  
a Head upon them,
when you seized them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Messenger.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, It was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before that Time that the Two Messengers   
came, Mr. <font>Turner</font>
and Mr. <font>Speare</font> , and seiz'd the Papers, and afterwards one of    
them went for
Mr. <font>Stanyan</font> ; I ask you, Whether you had shown those Bundles to  
any Body
before that Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I had shown them to no Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She hath said so Two or Three Times before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, Mr. <font>Ketelbey</font> , we must direct 
you not to spend the Time    
of the Court so. You have ask'd her that Question Two or Three Times 
over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I would very fain have the Truth  
come out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will ask you a Question or Two. What   
Trade or Business
do you follow? What is your Trade or Occupation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is that to you? I have no Trade.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should have ask'd you another Question 
before; Have you
not a Promise of Reward for the Service you do here, in giving this  
Evidence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I have not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor you have received none?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. You are an unjust Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you promised any Reward! Why don't    
you ask her whether
she is to swear for Hire? Is that a proper Question to ask a Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ketelbey.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I submit it to your Lordship, whether it   
is not proper to ask
her this Question; Whether she hath not told any Person, and whom,   
that she
was to have a Reward for coming hither?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Question is, Whether she hath never owned 
and confessed to
any Body, that these Papers were opened before a Friend of hers,     
before the
Messenger seized them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I never did. I never opened     
them before any Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They have ask'd you what Names you went    
by; Do you know
what Names the Prisoner at the Bar has gone by?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He had once given me Orders, that if any     
Letter came directed in
the Name of <font>Fountaine</font> , that I should take it in, accordingly in 
Two or Three
Days Time, there came a Letter, directed to Mr. <font>Fountaine</font> , and  
I took it in;
and when he came I gave it to him, and he opened it, and read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is your House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where! where you left the Writings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can you tell how that Letter was          
directed, which you took in
since you say you cannot Read?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was directed to Mr. <font>Fountaine</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you read the Superscription?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. Mrs. <font>Cook</font> did. 
<pagebreak id="69" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you was desired by Mr.            
<font>Layer</font> , when any Letter came
directed to Mr. <font>Fountaine</font> , to take it in; and that a Letter     
came directed to
Mr. <font>Fountaine</font> , and you took it in. The Question is asked you,   
since you cannot
read, how could you tell it was directed to Mr. <font>Fountaine</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Landlady told me it was for Mr.           
<font>Fountaine</font> , and she knew he
went by the Name of <font>Fountaine</font> sometimes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She said she read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Mason.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. I said I gave it to you, and you open'd  
it, and you read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Occasion of this Question is, that    
this <font>Misnomer</font> was
approved of by you. She says that you order'd her, that if any       
Letter came directed
to Mr. <font>Fountaine</font> , she should take it in; a Letter did come      
directed so, she took it
in, and then deliver'd it to you; and you receiv'd it from her, and  
open'd and
read it; but how, say they, cou'd you know this Letter was directed  
to Mr.
<font>Fountaine</font> , when you can neither write nor read? She having      
receiv'd such an Order,
when there was a Letter come, it was natural enough, that she that   
cou'd not
read, should ask her Landlady the Directions of the Letter, and it   
was directed
for <font>Fountaine</font> ; it was natural enough for her to take it in, and 
give it to you.
