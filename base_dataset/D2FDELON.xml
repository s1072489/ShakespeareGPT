   Doubtlesse </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth one,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I doubt some female spirit hath 
inchaunted <font>Iack</font> to his treadles, and coniured him within the
compasse of his Loome, that hee can stir no further. You say 
truth </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth <font>Iack</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and if you haue the leisure to stay till  
the
Charme bee done, the space of sixe dayes and fiue nights, you 
shall find mee ready to put on my holy daie apparell, and on 
Sunday morning for your paines I will giue you a pot of 
Ale ouer against the Maypole. Nay </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ile lay 
my life, that as the <font>Salamander</font> cannot liue without the fire, 
so <font>Iack</font> cannot liue without the smel of his Dames smocke. 
And I maruell </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth <font>Iacke</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that you beeing of the nature 
of the Herring (which so soone as hee is taken out of the Sea

Nay <font>Iacke</font> leaue thy testing </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and goe along

<pagebreak id="A4R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>When <font>Iacke</font> found the fauour to bee his dames 
Secretarie, he thought it an extraordinary kindnesse: and ghessing 
by the yarne it would prooue a good Web, began to question 
with his dame in this sort.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Although it becommeth not mee 
your seruant to prie into your secrets, nor to bee busie about 
matters of your loue: yet for so much as it hath pleased you 
<pagebreak id="A4V" />
to vse conference with mee in those causes, I pray you let 
me intreat you to know their names that bee your sutors, 
and of what profession they bee. 
   Marie <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith she</nonSpeech><dialogue> that you shall, and I pray thee take 
a cushion and sit downe by mee. Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth hee</nonSpeech><dialogue> I thanke 
you, but there is no reason I should sit on a cushion till I 
haue deserued it. If thou hast not thou mightest haue done 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said shee:</nonSpeech><dialogue> but faint souldiers neuer find fauour. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iohn</font> 
replied,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that makes mee indeed to want fauour: for I durst not 
trie Maydens because they seeme coy, nor Wiues for feare 
of their Husbands, nor Widowes, doubting their 
disdainfullnesse. Tush <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> hee that feares   
and doubts 
Womenkind, cannot bee counted Mankind: and take this 
for a principle, all things are not as they seeme: but let vs 
leaue this and proceed to our former matter. My first sutor 
dwels at <font>Wallingford</font> , by Trade a Tanner, a man of good 
wealth and his name is <font>Craftes</font> , of comly personage, and 
very good behauiour, a Widower, well thought of amongst 
his neighbours: hee hath proper land, a faire house and well
furnished, and neuer a childe in the world, and hee loues me
passing well. Why then Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth <font>Iohn</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you were best 
to haue him. Is that your opinion </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee?</nonSpeech><dialogue> now trust 
me, so it is not mine. For I finde two speciall reasons to the
contrary: the one is, that hee being ouerworne in yeares 
makes mee ouerloth to loue him: &amp; the other, that I know 
one neerer hand.
   Beleeue me dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iack</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue store is no    
sore, &amp;
profered ware is worse by ten in the hundred than that which 
is sought: but I pray ye who is your second sutor? <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth
shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> it may seeme immodesty in me to bewray my loues
secrets: yet seeing thy discretion, and being perswaded of thy
secrecy, I will shew thee: the other is a man of middle yeares, 
but yet a Batcheler, by occupation a Taylor, dwelling at
<font>Hungerford</font> : by report a very good husband, such a one as 
hath crownes good store, and to mee he professes much good 
will, for his person he may please any woman I dame </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
<font>Iohn</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> because he pleaseth you. Not so </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for my    
eies are
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
vnpartiall Iudges in that case: and albeit my opinion may be 
contrary to others, if his Art deceiue not my eye-sight, hee is
worthie of a good wife, both for his person and conditions. 
Then trust mee Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for so much as you are 
without doubt of your selfe that you will proue a good wife, 
and so well perswaded of him, I should thinke you could 
make no better a choice. Truly <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> there be 
also two reasons that mooue me not to like of him: the one, 
that being so long a ranger, he would at home be a stranger: 
and the other, that I like better of one nearer hand. Who is 
that, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth <font>Iacke</font> ?</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Saith shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> the third Suter is the   
Parson of
<font>Spinhome-land</font> , who hath a proper liuing, hee is of holy
conuersation &amp; good estimation, whose affection to me is great. 
No doubt Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you may doe wondrous well 
with him, where you shall haue no care but to serue GOD              
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: G O D</comment> 
and to make ready his meats. O <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the flesh 
and the spirit agrees not; for hee will bee so bent to his books, 
that hee will haue little minde of his bed: for one moneths 
studying for a Sermon, will make him forget his wife a whole 
yeer. Truely Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must needes speake in his
behalfe, and the rather for that he is a man of the Church, and 
your neere neighbour, to who~ (as I guesse) you beare the best
affection: I doe not thinke that hee will bee so much bound to 
his booke, or subiect to the spirit, but that he will remember a 
woman at home or abroad. Well <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wis my 
minde is not that way, for I like better of one nearer hand. 
No maruell </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iacke</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you are so peremptorie seeing you 
haue so much choice: but I pray ye Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> let me 
knowe this fortunate man that is so highly placed in your 
fauour? <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> they are worthy to knowe nothing, 
that cannot keepe something: that man (I tell thee) must goe
namelesse: for he is Lord of my loue, and King of my desires: 
there is neither Tanner, Taylor nor Parson, may compare 
with him, his presence is a preseruatiue to my health, his 
sweete smiles my hearts solace, and his words heauenly 
musike to my eares. Why then Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for your 
bodies health, your hearts ioy, and your eares delight, delay 
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
not the time, but entertaine him with a kisse, make his bed 
next yours, and chop vp the match in the morning. Well, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue thy consent is quickly got to anie, 
hauing no care how I am matcht so I bee matcht: I wis, I wis 
I could not let thee goe so lightly, beeing loath that any one 
should haue thee, except I could loue her as well as my selfe. 
I thanke you for your kindnesse and good will good Dame 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth hee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> but it is not wisedome for a young man that can 
scantly keepe himselfe, to take a wife: therefore I hould it the 
best way to leade a single life: for I haue heard say, that 
manie sorrowes followe mariage, especially where want 
remaines: and beside, it is a hard matter to finde a constant 
woman: for as young <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: yonng</comment> maides are fickle, so are 
old women 
iealous: the one a griefe too common, the other a torment 
intolerable. What <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> consider that maidens
ficklenesse proceedes of vaine fancies, but old womens iealousie of
superabounding loue, and therefore the more to bee borne 
withall. But Dame, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth hee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> many are iealous without 
cause: for is it sufficient for their mistrusting natures to take
exceptions at a shadow, at a word, at a looke, at a smile, nay 
at the twinkle of an eye, which neither man nor woman is 
able to expell? I knewe a woman that was readie to hang 
her selfe, for seeing but her husbands shirt hang on a hedge 
with her maides smocke. I grant that this furie may haunt 
some, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> yet there be many other that complaine not 
without great cause. Why, is there any cause that should 
moue iealousie, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth <font>Iohn</font> ?</nonSpeech><dialogue> I by S. <font>Mary</font> is there       
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
for would it not grieue a woman (being one euery way able 
to delight her husband) to see him forsake her, despise and 
contemne her, being neuer so merrie as when he is in other 
company, sporting abroad from morning till noone, from noone 
till night, and when he comes to bed, if hee turne to his wife, 
it is in such solemnesse, and wearisome drowsie lamenesse, that 
it brings rather lothsomnesse than any delight: can you then 
blame a woman in this case to bee angrie and displeased? Ile 
tell you what, among brute beasts it is a griefe intolerable: 
for I heard my Grandame tell that the Bel-weather of her 
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
flocke fancying one of the Eawes aboue the rest, and seeing 
<font>Gratis</font> the Shepheard abusing her, in abhominable sort 
(subuerting the lawe of Nature) could by no meanes beare that 
abuse; but watching opportunity for reuenge, on a time found 
the said Shepheard sleeping in the field, and suddenly ranne 
against him in such violent sort, that by the force of his 
wreathen hornes, hee beat the braines out of the Shepheards head 
and slewe him. If then a Sheepe could not endure that iniurie, 
thinke not that women are so sheepish to suffer it. Beleeue 
mee </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if euery horne-maker should be so plagued 
by a horned beast, there should bee lesse hornes made in 
<font>Newberie</font> by many in a yeare. But Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth hee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> to make an 
end of this prattle, because it is an argument too deepe to be
discussed betweene you and I, you shal heare me sing an ould 
song, and so wee will depart to supper. 
<comment type="compiler">SONG OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
   Well said <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> thy song is not so sure, but 
thy
voice is as sweet: but seeing the time agrees with our 
stomackes, though loth yet will wee giue ouer for this time, and
betake our selues to our suppers. <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">JACK WONDERS WHETHER TO MARRY HIS MISTRESS.</comment>
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>His Dame comming 
home and hearing that her man was gone to bed, tooke that 
night but small rest, and early in the morning hearing him 
vp at his worke merrily singing, shee by and by arose, and in 
seemely sort attyring her selfe, she came into the worke-shop, 
and sat her downe to make quills. Quoth <font>Iohn</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Good morow 
Dame, how do you to day? God a mercie <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
euen as well as I may: for I was sore troubled in my 
Dreames. Mee thought two Doues walked together in a 
corne field, the one (as it were) in communication with the 
other, without regard of picking vp any thing to sustaine 
themselues: and after they had with many nods spent some 
time to their content, they both fell hard, with their pretie 
bils, to pecke vp the scattered corne, left by the wearie 
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
Reapers hand. At length (finding themselues satisfied) it chanced
another Pigion to light in that place, with whome one of the 
first Pigions at length kept companie: and after, returning 
to the place where she left her first companion, perceiued he 
was not there, shee kindly searching vp and downe the high 
stubble to finde him, lighted at length on a hogge fast asleep,
wherewith me thought the poore Doue was so dismaid, that 
presently shee fell downe in a trance. I seeing her legges 
faile, and her wings quiuer, yeelding her selfe to death, 
moued with pittie ranne vnto her, and thinking to take vp the 
Pigion, mee thought I had in my hands my owne heart, 
wherein me thought an arrow stucke so deepe, that the bloud 
trickled downe the shaft, and lay vpon the feathers like the 
siluer pearled deawe on the greene grasse, which made me to 
weepe most bitterly. But presently mee thought there came 
one to me crowned like a Queene, who tould mee my heart 
would die, except in time I got some of that sleeping hogges 
grease to heale the wounds thereof. Whereupon I ranne in 
all haste to the Hog with my heart bleeding in my hand, who 
(mee thought) grunted at mee in most churlish sort, and 
vanisht out of my sight. Whereupon comming straite home, 
me thought I found this Hog rustling among my Loomes, 
wherewith I presently awaked, sodainely after midnight, 
beeing all in a sweate and very ill <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: til</comment> : and I am  
sure you could 
not choose but heare mee groane. Trust mee Dame I heard 
you not </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth <font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was so sound asleepe. And thus     
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth
shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> a woman may die in the night before you will haue the 
care to see what shee ailes, or aske what she lackes. But 
truly <font>Iohn</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> all is one, for if thou shouldest   
haue come, 
thou couldest not haue got in, because my chamber door was 
lockt: but while I liue this shall teach mee wit, for 
henceforth I will haue no other lock but a latch, till I am 
married. Then Dame </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth he) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue though you bee 
curious in your choise, yet at length you will marrie. I truly 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> so thou wilt not hinder me. Who I

on my faith Dame not for a hundred pounds, but rather 
will further you to the vttermost of my power. Indeede 
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> thou hast no reason to shew any discurtesie to me 
in that matter, although some of our neighbours do not stick 
to say, that I am sure to thee alreadie. If it were so </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth 
<font>Iohn</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> there is no cause to denie it, or to bee ashamed       
thereof,
knowing my selfe farre vnworthie of so high a fauour. Well 
let this talke rest </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and take there thy quils, for it 
is
time for me to goe to market. 
<comment type="compiler">A TAILOR PROPOSES TO THE WIDOW.</comment> 
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>the Widow with patience heard him, 
and gently answered, that in respect of his great good will 
long time borne vnto her, as also in regard of his gentlenesse 
cost and curtesie, at that present bestowed, shee would not 
flatly denie him.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Therefore </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> seeing this is not 
a place to conclude of such matters: if I may intreate you to 
come to my poore house on Thursday next, you shall be 
heartily welcome, and be further satisfied of my minde: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and thus

preferred to a touch of her lips, hee payed the shot and 
departed. The Taylor was scant out of sight, when shee met with 
the Tanner: who albeit hee was aged, yet lustily he saluted 
her, and to the wine she must, there was no nay. The 
Widow seeing his importunacie, calles her gossip, and along 
they walked together. The olde man called for wine plentie, 
and the best cheere in the house: and in hartie manner hee 
biddes the Widow welcome. They had not sitten long, but in 
comes a noyse of Musitions in tawnie coates, who (putting 
off their caps) asked if they would haue any Musicke. The 
Widow answered no, they were merrie enough.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Tut </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
the oldeman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let vs heare good fellowes what you can doe, 
and play mee <font>The beginning of the World</font> . Alas, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the 
widow,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you had more need to harken to y=e= ending of the world. 
Why Widowe, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth hee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell thee the beginning of the 
world was the begetting of Children: and if you find mee 
faultie in that occupation, turne mee out of thy bed for a 
bungler, and then send for the Sexton. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Hee had no sooner 
spoke the word, but the Parson of <font>Speen</font> with his corner cap, 
popt in at the doore, who seeing the widow sitting at the table 
craued pardon and came in. Quoth shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for want of the 
Sexton, heere is the Priest if you need him. Mary </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth 
the Tanner) </nonSpeech><dialogue> in good time, for by this meanes wee need not 
goe farre to bee married. Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall doe 
my best in conuenient place. Wherein, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Tanner?</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
To wed her my selfe </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay soft, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayde the 
Widow,</nonSpeech><dialogue> one Swallow makes not a Sommer, nor one 
meeting a marriage: as I lighted on you vnlookt for, so came I 
hither vnprouided for the purpose. I trust </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the 
Tanner,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you came not without your eyes to see, your tongue to 
speake, your eares to heare, your hands to feele, nor your legs 
to goe. I brought my eyes, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to discerne colours, my 
tongue to say No to questions I like not, my hands to thrust 
from me the things y=t= I loue not, my eares to iudge twixt 
flatterie &amp; friendship &amp; my feet to run from such as would wrong
me. Why then </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson</nonSpeech><dialogue> by your gentle abiding in 
this place, it is euident that here are none but those you like and 
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
loue. God forbid I should hate my friends </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the widow) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
whom I take all these in this place to bee. But, there be 
diuers sorts of loues, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You say truth, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
the Widow:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I loue your selfe for your profession, and my 
friend the Tanner, for his curtesie and kindnesse, and the rest 
for their good company. Yet </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the Parson) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for the 
explaining of your loue, I pray you drinke to them you loue 
best in the company. Why </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the Tanner) </nonSpeech><dialogue> haue you 
any hope in her loue? Beleeue me </dialogue><nonSpeech> (saith the Parson) </nonSpeech><dialogue> as much 
as another. Why then Parson sit downe, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Tanner:</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
for, you that are equall with mee in desire, shall surely be halfe 
with mee in the shotte: and so Widow, on Gods name fulfill 
the Parsons request. Seeing </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the widow) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you are so 
pleasantly bent, if my courtesie <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: corrtesie</comment> might    
not breede contention 
betweene you, and that I may haue your fauour to shewe my 
fancie, I will fulfill your request. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Quoth the Parson,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am 
pleased howsoeuer it bee. And I, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Tanner.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why 
then </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> with this cup of Claret wine and Sugar, I 
heartily drinke to the Ministrels boy. Why, is it hee you loue 
best, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson?</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue reason, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to like and 
loue them best, that will bee least offended with my doings. 
Nay Widow </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth they) </nonSpeech><dialogue> wee meant you should drinke to 
him whom you loued best in y=e= way of marriage. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Quoth the 
Widow,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you should haue sayd so at first: but, to tell you 
my opinion, it is small discretion for a woman to disclose her 
secret affection in an open assembly: therefore, if to that 
purpose you spake, let mee intreat you both to come home to my 
house on Thursday next, where you shall be heartily 
welcome, and there be fully resolued of my mind: and so, with 
thankes at this time, Ile take my leaue. <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">THE WIDOW PREPARES A FEAST.</comment>
<pagebreak id="C1R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>At length the guests being come, the Widow bad them al 
heartily welcome. The Priest and the Tanner seeing the 
Taylor, mused what hee made there: the Taylor on the 
other side, maruelled as much at their presence. Thus 
looking strangely one at another, at length the widow came out 
of the kitchin, in a faire traine gowne stucke full of siluer 
pinnes, a fine white cap on her head, with cuts of curious 
needle worke vnder the same, and an apron before her as 
white as the driuen snowe: then verie modestly making 
curtsie to them all, shee requested them to sit downe. But they
straining curtesie the one with the other, the Widow with a 
smiling countenance, tooke the Parson by the hand saying:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir, as you stand highest in the Church, so is it meet you 
should sit highest at the Table: and therefore I pray you sit 
downe there on the bench side. And sir </dialogue><nonSpeech>said shee to the 
Tanner,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as age is to bee honoured before youth for their 
experience, so are they to sit aboue Batchelers for their grauitie,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and so she set him downe on this side the Table, ouer against 
the Parson. Then comming to the Taylor shee sayd;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Batchler, though your lot bee the last, your welcome is equall with
the first, and seeing your place points out it selfe, I pray you 
take a cushion and sit downe. And now </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> to make 
the boord equall, and because it hath beene an ould saying, that 
three things are to small purpose, if the fourth be awaie: if so 
it may stand with your fauours, I will call in a Gossip of 
mine to supplie this voide place. With a good will </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
they.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />

<comment type="compiler">THEY ALL EAT AND DRINK HEARTILY.</comment> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>The Parson pledged her, and so did all the rest in due order; 
but still in their company the cup past ouer the poor olde

merrie vaine) spake thus vnto the companie:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue had 
much good meate among you; but as for the drinke I can no

perceiue no man hath drunke to thee yet. No truly </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the 
old Woman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for Churchmen haue so much minde of young 
Rabbets, old men such ioie in young Chickens. and 
Bachelors in Pigs flesh take such delight, that an old Sow, a tough
Henne, or a gray Coney are not accepted: and so it is seene by 
mee, else I should haue beene better remembred. Well old 
woman </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson,</nonSpeech><dialogue> take heere the leg of a Capon to 
stop thy mouth. Now by S. <font>Anne</font> I dare not, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No?
wherefore </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Parson?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Marie for feare least you should 
goe home with a Crutch, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee. The Taylor said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> then 
taste here a peece of Goose. Now God forbid, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayde the old 
Woman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let Goose goe to his kinde: you haue a young 
stomacke, eate it your selfe, and much good may it doo your hart 
sweet young man The old woman lacks most of her teeth, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Tanner,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and therefore a peece of tender Chicke 
is fittest for her. If I did lacke as many of my teeth, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
the olde woman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as you lacke points of good husbandrie, I 
doubt I should starue before it were long. </dialogue><nonSpeech>At this the 
Widowe laught heartily, and the men were stricken into such a 
dumpe, that they had not a word to say. Dinner being 
ended, the widow with the rest rose from the Table, and after 
they had sitten a pretie while merrily talking, the Widow  
<pagebreak id="C2R" />
called her man <font>Iohn</font> to bring her a bowle of fresh ale, which 
he did. Then sayd the Widow:</nonSpeech><dialogue> My masters, now for your 
curtesie and cost I heartily thanke you all, and in requitall 
of all your fauour, loue and good-will, I drinke to you, 
giuing you free libertie when you please to depart. </dialogue><nonSpeech>At these 
wordes her sutor <comment type="compiler">LATER PRINTINGS: sutors</comment> looked so sowrely one   
vpon another, as if 
they had beene newly champing of Crabs Which when the 
Taylor heard, shaking vp himselfe in his new russet Ierkin, 
and setting his hat on one side, hee began to speake thus.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
trust sweete widow </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth hee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you remember to what ende 
my comming was hither to day, I haue long time beene a 
sutor vnto you, and this day you promised to giue me a direct 
answer. Tis true, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and so I haue: for your loue 
I giue you thankes, and when you please you may depart. 
Shall I not haue you </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Taylor?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the 
Widow) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you come too late. Good friend </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the Tanner) </nonSpeech><dialogue> it 
is manners for young men to let their elders bee serued 
before them: to what end should I bee here if the widow should 
haue thee? a flat deniall is meete for a saucie sutor: but what 
saist thou to mee faire widow </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the Tanner) ?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> because you are so sharp set, I would wish you as 
soon as you can to wed. Appoint the time your self </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the 
Tanner.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Euen assoone </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> as you can get a Wife, 
and hope not after mee, for I am alreadie promised. Now 
Tanner you may take your place with the Taylor, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
the Parson,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for indeede the Widow is for no man but my 
selfe. Master Parson </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> many haue runne neere the 
goale, and yet lost the game, and I cannot helpe it though 
your hope bee in vaine: besides, Parsons are but newly 
suffered to haue wiues, and for my part I will haue none of the 
first head. What </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth the Taylor) </nonSpeech><dialogue> is our merriment 
growne to this reckoning? I neuer spent a Pig and a Goose 
to so bad purpose before? I promise you when I came in, I 
verilie thought that you were inuited by the Widowe to 
make her and me sure together, and that the iolly 
Tanner was brought to bee a witnesse to the contract, and the 
old Woman fetcht in for the same purpose; else I woulde
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
neuer haue put vp so many drie bobs at her hands. And 
surely </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Tanner,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I knowing thee to bee a Taylor, did 
assuredly think that thou wast appointed to come and take 
measure for our wedding apparell. But now we are all 
deceiued </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Parson,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and therefore as wee came fooles, 
so wee may depart hence like asses. That is as you interpret 
the matter, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Widow:</nonSpeech><dialogue> for I euer doubting that a 
concluding answer would breede a iarre in the end among you 
euery one, I thought it better to bee done at one instant, and 
in mine owne house, than at sundry times and in common 
Tauernes: and as for the meate you sent, as it was 
vnrequested of mee, so had you your part thereof, and if you think
good to take home the remainder, prepare your wallets 
and you shall haue it. Nay Widow </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> although 
wee haue lost our labours, wee haue not altogether lost our 
manners: that, which you haue keepe, and God send to vs 
better lucke, and to you your hearts desire, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and with that 
they departed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Widow being glad shee was thus rid of her guestes, 
when her man <font>Iohn</font> with all the rest sate at supper, she sitting 
in a chaire by, spake thus vnto them.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well my masters, you 
sawe that this day your poore Dame had her choise of

and I pray God you <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: yun</comment> haue not withstoode your

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iohn</font> being a kind young man would not say her nay, and 
so they spent the rest of the night both together in one bed.

   <nonSpeech>The next daie the report was ouer all the Towne, that 
<font>Iacke</font> of <font>Newbery</font> had married his Dame: so that when the 
Woman walked abroad, euery one bad God giue her ioy: 
some said that shee was matcht to her sorrow, saying, that so 
lustie a young man as he, would neuer loue her being so 
auncient. Whereupon the Woman made answer, that shee 
would take him downe in his wedding shooes, and woulde 
trie his patience in the prime of his lustinesse: whereunto 
many of her Gossips did likewise encourage her. Euery daie 
therefore for the space of a moneth after shee was married, it 
was her ordinarie custome, to goe forth in the morning 
among her gossips and acquaintance to make merrie, and 
not to returne home till night, without any regarde of her 
houshold. Of which, at her comming home, her husband did 
very oftentimes admonish her in very gentle sort, shewing 
what great inconuenience would grow thereby: the which 
sometime shee would take in gentle part, and somtime in 
disdaine, saying;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   I am now in very good case, that hee which was my 
seruant but the other day, will now bee my master: this it is for 
a Woman to make her foot her head. The day hath beene 
when I might haue gone forth when I would, and come 
in againe when it had pleased me without controulement: &amp; 
now I must bee subiect to euery Iackes checke. I am sure 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that by my gadding abroad, and carelesse spending 
I waste no goods of thine. I pittying thy pouertie, made thee 
a man, and maister of the house, but not to the end I woulde 
become thy slaue. I scorne, I tel thee true, that such a 
youngling as thy selfe should correct my conceit, and giue mee
instructions, as if I were not able to guide my selfe: but yfaith
yfaith, you shall not vse me like a babe, nor bridle me like an
Asse: and seeing my going abroad greeues thee, where I 
haue gone forth one day I will goe abroad three, and for 
one houre I will stay fiue. Well </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth her husband) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I

<pagebreak id="C4V" />
   <nonSpeech>Thus the time past on, till on a certaine day shee had beene
abroad in her wonted manner, and staying forth very late he 
shut the dores and went to bed. About midnight shee comes 
to the doore and knockes to come in: to whom he looking out 
of the window, answered in this sort.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   What, is it you that keepes such a knocking? I pray you 
get hence and request the Constable to prouide you a bed, 
for this night, you shall haue no lodging heere. I hope </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you will not shut me out of doores like a dogge, or let me 
lie in the streetes like a strumpet. Whether like a dogge or 
drab, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth hee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> all is one to mee, knowing no reason but that 
as you haue stayed out all day for your delight, so you may 
lie foorth all night for my pleasure. Both birds and beastes

He stood calling with the candle in his hand to come in, but 
shee made as if shee heard not. Anon shee went vp into her 
chamber, and carried the key with her: but when hee sawe 
she would not answere, he presently began to knock as lowd  
<pagebreak id="D1R" />
as hee could at the doore. At last shee thrust her head out at

   What sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is it you? haue you nothing to doe

a Spirit of the Butterie hunt after Crickets, are you so hot 
that the house cannot hold you? Nay I pray thee, sweet heart 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth he</nonSpeech><dialogue> doo not gibe any longer, but let me in. O sir, 
remember </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> how you stood euen now at the window, like a 
Iudge on the bench, and in taunting sort kept me out of my 
owne howse. How now <font>Iacke</font> , am I euen with you? What 
<font>Iohn</font> my man, were you so lustie to lock your Dame out of 
doores? Sirra, remember you bad me goe to the Constable 
to get lodging: now you haue leisure to trie if his wife will 
preferre you to a bed. You sir Sawce, that made me stand in 
the colde till my feete did freeze, and my teeth chatter, while 
you stood preaching of birds and beasts telling mee a tale of 
spiders, flyes, and frogges: goe trie now if any of them will 
be so fre~dly to let thee haue lodging. Why go you not man? 
feare not to speake with them, for I am sure you shall finde 
them at home: thinke not they are such ill husbands as you, 
to bee abroad at this time of night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>With this, <font>Iohns</font> patience was greatly moued, insomuch

rose betime, and merily made him a Cawdell, and bringing

turne the sweete flowers of good counsell into venemous 
poyson, from henceforth I will leaue you to your own 
wilfulnes, and neither vexe my minde nor trouble my selfe to 
restraine you: the which if I had wisely done last night, I had 
kept the house in quiet, and my selfe from cold. Husband

will not sticke (like the Pellican) to pearce their owne hearts 
to doo them good. And therefore forgiuing each other all

lands are his Loomes, hauing no other Rents but what I get 
from the backes of little sheepe, nor can I claime any 
cognisance but a wodden shuttle. Neuerthelesse, most gratious 
Queene, these my poore servants and my selfe, with life and 
goods are readie at your Maiesties commaund, not onely to 
spend our blouds, but also to lose our liues in defence of our 
King and Countrey.
   Welcome to mee <font>Iacke</font> of <font>Newberie</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>saide the Queene,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
though a Clothier by trade, yet a Gentleman by condition, 
and a faithfull subiect in heart: and if thou chance to haue 
any sute in Court, make account the queene will bee thy 
friend, and would to God the King had many such Clothiers. 
But tell mee, how came thy white coate besmeared with 
bloud, and thy face so bescratcht? May it please your Grace 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth hee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> to vnderstand, that it was my chaunce to meete 
with a Monster, who like the people <font>Cynomolgy</font> , had the 
proportion of a man, but headed like a dogge, the biting of 
whose teeth was like the poysoned tooth of a Crocodile, his 
breath like the Basilisks, killing afarre off. I vnderstand, 
his name was Enuie, who assailed mee inuisibly, like the 
wicked spirit of <font>Mogunce</font> , who flung stones at men and could 
not bee seene: and so I come by my scratcht face, not 
knowing when it was done. What was the cause this monster 
<pagebreak id="E1V" />
should afflict thee aboue the rest of thy companie, or other 
men in the field. Although most Souereigne Queen, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
hee,</nonSpeech><dialogue> this poysoned curre snarleth at many, and that few can 
escape the hurt of his wounding breath, yet at this time hee 
bent his force against mee, not for any hurt I did him, but 
because I surpast him in heartie affection to my Souereigne 
Lord, and with the poore Widowe offered all I had to serue 
my Prince and Countery. It were happy for <font>England</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd 
the Queene,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if in euery market Towne there were a Iybbet 
to hang vp curres of that kind: who like <font>Aesops</font> dogge lying 
in the maunger, will doe no good himselfe, nor suffer such 
as would to doe any.

 <head>How <font>Iack</font> of <font>Newbery</font> keeping a very good house, both for 
his seruants and reliefe of the poore, won great credit 
therby, and how one of his wiues gossips found fault therwith.</head> <dialogue>

   Good morrow Gossip, now by my truely I am glad 
to see you in health. I pray you how dooth Maister 
<font>Winchcombe</font> ? What neuer a great belly yet? now fie, by 
my fa your husband is waxt idle. Trust mee Gossip, </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith 
mistresse <font>Winchcombe</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> a great belly comes sooner then 
a new coate, but you must consider wee haue not beene long 
married: but truly gossip you are welcome, I pray you 
sit down and we will haue a morsell of something by and by:
nay truely Gossip I cannot stay </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> indeede I must 
be gone: for I did but euen step in to see how you did. You 
shall not chuse but stay a while </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth mistris <font>Winchcombe</font> ,
and with that a fayre Napken was layd vpon the little 
Table in the Parlour, hard by the fire side, whereon was set a 
fine cold Capon, with a a <comment type="compiler">SO IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> great deale of other 
good cheare, 
with Ale and Wine plentie:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray you Gossip eate, and 
I beshrew you if you spare </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the one,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I thanke you 
heartily Gossip </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith the other.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But heare you Gossip, I pray 
you tell mee: doth your husband loue you well, and make 
much of you? yes truly I thanke God </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee:</nonSpeech><dialogue> now by 
my truth </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd the other,</nonSpeech><dialogue> it were a shame for him if hee should 
not: for though I say it before your face, though he had little 
with you, yet you were worthy to bee as good a mans wife 
as his. Trust me I would not change my <font>Iohn</font> for my Lord 
Marquesse, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she:</nonSpeech><dialogue> a woman can be but well, for I liue at 
hearts ease, and haue all things at will, and truly hee will not 
see mee lacke any thing. Gods blessing on his heart </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth 
her Gossip,</nonSpeech><dialogue> it is a good hearing: but I pray you tell mee, I 
heard say your husband is chosen for our Burgesse in the 
Parliament house, is it true? Yes verily </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth his wife.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I 
wis it is against his will; for it will be no small charges 
vnto him: Tush woman, what talke of you <comment type="compiler">LATER PRINTINGS: you of</comment>

God, there is neuer a Gentleman in all <font>Barkshire</font> that is 
better able to beare it. But heare you Gossip, shall I bee so 
bold to aske you one question more? Yes, withall my heart 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard say that your husband would now put 
you in your hood, and silke gowne, I pray you is it true? Yes
in truth, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth mistresse <font>Winchcomb</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> but farre against my 
mind, Gossip: my french hood is bought already, and 
my silke gowne is a making, likewise the Goldsmith hath 
brought home my chayne and bracelets: but I assure you 
Gossip, if you will beleeue mee, I had rather go an hundred 
miles then weare them, for I shall bee so ashamed that I shall 
not looke vpon any of my neighbors for blushing. And why 
I pray you? </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth her Gossip.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you deare woman, 
you need not be any thing abashed or blush at the matter, 
especially seeing your husbands estate is able to maintaine 
it: now trust me truly, I am of opinion you will become 
it singular well. Also </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth mistresse <font>Winchcombe</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> hauing 
neuer beene vsed to such attyre, I shall not know where I 
am, nor how to behaue my selfe in it: and beside, my 
complexion is so blacke, that I shall carry but an ill fauoured
countenance vnder a hood. Now without doubt </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth 
her Gossip) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you are to blame to say so: beshrew my heart 
if I speake it to flatter; you are a very faire and well fauored 
young woman as any is in <font>Newbery</font> . And neuer feare 
your behauiour in your hood: for I tel you true, as old and 
withered as I am my selfe, I could become a hood well enough, 
and behaue my selfe as well in such attyre as any other 
whatsoeuer, and I would not learne of neuer a one of them 
all: what woman, I haue beene a prety wench in my dayes, 
and seene some fashions. Therefore you need not to feare, 
seeing both your beauty and comely personage deserues no 
lesse then a french hood, and bee of good comfort. At the first
(possible) folkes will gaze something at you: but bee not you 
abashed for that, it is better they should wonder at your 
good fortune, then lament at your miserie: but when they 
haue seene you two or three times in that attyre they will 
afterward little respect it: for euery new thing at the first
<pagebreak id="K1V" />
seemes rare, but being once a little vsed, it growes common. 
Surely gossip you say true, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> and I am but a 
foole to bee so bashfull: it is no shame to vse Gods gifts for 
your credites: and well might my husband thinke me 
vnworthy to haue them, if I would not weare them: and though 
I say it, my hoode is a fayre one, as any woman weares in 
this countrey, and my gold chaine and bracelets are none of 
the worst sort, and I will shew them you, because you shall 
giue your opinion vpon them: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and therewithall shee stept 
into her chamber and fetcht them foorth. When her Gossip 
say them, shee sayd:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now beshrew my fingers but these are 
fayre ones indeede. And when doe you meane to weare them 
Gossip? At Whitsontide </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth shee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if God spare mee life. 
I wish that well you may weare them, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd her Gossip,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and 
I would I were worthie to bee with you when you dresse 
your selfe, it should bee neuer the worse for you: I would 
order the matter so, that you should set euery thing about 
you in such sort as neuer a Gentlewoman of them all should 
staine you. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mistresse <font>Winchombe</font> gaue her great thankes 
for her fauour, saying, that if she needed her helpe, she would 
be bold to send for her.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then beganne her gossip to turne her tongue to another 
tune, and now to blame her for her great house keeping. And 
thus she beganne:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Gossip, you are but a young woman, and 
one that hath had no great experience of the World, in my 
opinion you are something too lauish in expences: pardon 
me good gossip, I speake but for good will; and because I loue 
you, I am the more bolde to admonish you: I tell you plain, 
were I the Mistresse of such a house, hauing such large 
allowance as you haue, I would saue 20. pound a yeare that 
you spend to no purpose. Which way might that be </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth 
mistres <font>Winchcombe</font> ?) </nonSpeech><dialogue> indeed I confesse I am but a greene
housewife, and one that hath but small tryall in the world, 
therefore I should bee verie glad to learne any thing that 
were for my husbands profite, and my commoditie. Then 
listen to mee </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth shee:</nonSpeech><dialogue> You feede poor folkes with the best 
of the beefe, and the finest of the wheate, which in my 
<pagebreak id="K2R" />
opinion is a great ouersight: neither do I heare of any Knight 
in this countrey that doth it. And to say the truth, how were 
they able to beare that port which they doe, if they saued it 
not by some meanes? Come thither, and I warrant you that 
you shall see but browne bread on the boord: if it be wheate 
and rie mingled together, it is a great matter, and the bread 
highly commended: but most commonly they eate either 
barlybread, or rie mingled with pease, and such like course 
graine: which is doubtlesse, but of small price, and there is no 
other bread allowed, except at their owne boord. And in like 
manner for their meate: it is well knowne that neckes and 
poynts of beefe is their ordinarie fare: which because it is 
commonly leane, they seeth therewith now and then a peece 
of bacon or porke, whereby they make their pottage fat, and 
therewith driues out the rest with more content. And thus 
must you learne to doe. And beside that, the midriffes of the 
Oxen, and the cheekes, the sheepes heads, and the gathers, 
which you giue away at your gate, might serue them well 
enough: which would be a great sparing to your other meat, 
and by this meanes you would saue in the yeare much 
mony, whereby you might the better maintaine your hood and 
silke gowne. Againe, you serue your folkes with such 
superfluities, that they spoyle in manner as much as they 
eate: beleeue me were I their Dame, they should haue 
things more sparingly, and then they would thinke it more 
daintie. Trust mee gossip </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth Mistresse <font>Winchcombe</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I know your wordes in many things to bee true: for my 
folkes are so corne fed, that wee haue much adoe to please 
them in their dyet: one doth say this is too salt: and another 
saith this is too grosse, this is too fresh, and that too fat, and
twentie faults they will finde at their meales: I warrant 
you they make such parings of their cheese, and keepe 
such chipping of their bread, that their very ortes would 
serue two or three honest folkes to their dinner. And 
from whence I pray you proceedes that </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth her 
Gossip) </nonSpeech><dialogue> but of too much plentie? but yfaith were they my 
seruants, I would make them glad of the worst crumme 
<pagebreak id="K2V" />
they cast away, and thereupon I drinke to you, and I thanke 
you for my good cheere with all my heart. Much good may 
it doe you good gossip, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd mistresse <font>Winchcombe</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> and I 
pray you when you come this way let vs see you. That 
you shall verily </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she, and so away she went.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>After this, mistresse <font>Winchcomb</font> tooke occasion to giue 
her folks shorter commons, and courser meate then they were 
wont to haue: which at length being come to the good mans 
eare, hee was very much offended therewith, saying:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will 
not haue my people thus pincht of their victuals. Emptie 
platters make greedy stomackes, and where scarcitie is 
kept, hunger is nourished: and therefore wife as you loue 
mee let me haue no more of this doings Husband </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth she) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
I would they should haue enough: but it is a sinne to suffer, 
and a shame to see the spoyle they make: I could bee verie 
well content to giue them their bellyes full, and that which 
is sufficient, but it grieues me, to tell you true, to see how coy
they are, and the small care they haue in wasting of things: 
and I assure you, the whole towne cryes shame of it, and 
it hath bred me no small discredit for looking no better to it. 
Trust me no more, if I was not checkt in my owne house, 
about this matter, when my eares did burne to heare what 
was spoken. Who was it that checkt thee, I pray thee tell 
mee? was it not your old gossip, dame dayntie, mistresse trip 
and go? I beleeue it was. Why man if it were she, you know 
shee hath beene an old housekeeper, and one that hath known 
the world; and that shee told mee was for good will. Wife 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth hee) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would not haue thee to meddle with such light 
braind huswiues, and so I haue told thee a good many times, 
and yet I cannot get you to leaue her company. Leaue her 
company? why husband so long as she is an honest woman, 
why should I leaue her company? Shee neuer gaue mee 
hurtfull counsell in all her life, but hath alwayes been 
ready to tell me things for my profit, though you take it not so.
Leaue her company? I am no gyrle I would you should 
well know, to bee taught what company I should keepe: I 
keepe none but honest company I warrant you. Leaue her 
<pagebreak id="K3R" />
company ketha? Alas poore soule, this reward she hath for 
her good will. I wis I wis, she is more your friend, then you 
are your owne. Well let her be what she will </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd her 
husband:</nonSpeech><dialogue> but if shee come any more in my house, shee were as 
good no. And therefore take this for a warning I would 
aduise you: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so away he went.</nonSpeech>
