thou lookest coy to day; what's the
matter prethee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kate.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I had been so at first to you I had been
wiser.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I find you flatter me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I scorn it, I am true to thee, in troth I am
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How shall I believe that, when every one you
meet, you are courting and kissing them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who told you these stories, truly I never 
kiss any one but in mirth, for I will never marry
any but thee my love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hear of your Roguery, that I do, pray what
was that you said to Peg Ramskin 'tother day, did
not you kiss her, and gripe her by the hand, and tell
her you lov'd her dearly? and now she brags about
the Town how she hath deceived me, the Devil take
such love, if this be the love you have for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be not in such a passion, 'ile tell you how
it was.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall not hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear heart, hear me, by this kiss ile tell
thee truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In troth 'twas onely thus, I was going to the
mill with Corn, and by the way, I met with <font>Pegg
Ramskin</font> , good morrow <font>John</font> said she, her's a cold
morning, a cup of Ale would do well, I think so
too said I, faith <font>John</font> ile joyn my penny with thee,
I was ashamed to deny her, so we went in and
called for one pot, the jade was very kind and
took me by the hand and shak't it, <font>John</font> , said she,
I believe you are in love you are so dumpish, O
yes said I, you look so lively this morning, I
thought you would fain be kist, I puld her by the
arm, and in troth she e'n fell upon me, this was all
and does this bold slut report that I love her? hang
her impudence, ile kick her next time, ile see how
she likes that kind of Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is onely because I know it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish you would believe me, and not be
thus jealous, pray be not so cruel to torment me
thus, no whore of them all shall entice me from
thee, O how I cou'd kick this jade.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well let this pass, but what was that you
said to the Widdow, these stories <font>John</font> could not be
raised of themselves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What gossiping slut troubles thee with these
fooleries, they do't to make difference.
<pagebreak id="5" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray tell me truth of this also, and then I
shall be satisfied.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By this kiss I will my dear; I was in a place
tother day drinking, and in came the Widdow
<font>Cragg</font> , how now <font>John</font> said she, what will you
dye a Batchellour? I think I must do so said I, for
Maids are so coy, ther's no dealing with them,
what think you of a widdow, they are more kind,
will you have me said I, O <font>John</font> said she, you
love to jest, I could do no less then kiss her, and
so parted; when will ye come to my house <font>John</font>
said she, what good cheer have you for a man said
I, you shall have a cup of the best said she, and a
good Gammon of Bacon: now thou knowest <font>Kate</font>
I love Bacon well, and because I would not be seen
with her alone, I took <font>Will Summers</font> with me, and
spent six pence a piece, and did eat up half her
Bacon, and when we were merry we kissed her;
well Widdow, quoth I, I find now that widows
are more kind than Maids, ile come again before
the Bacon be gone, with all my heart said she and
welcome: This was all truly my sweet love, and
does the fool report <font>I</font> came a suiting to her, wanton
whore, ile ne'r come within her doors more; I
shall shun both Maids and widdows, unless in thy
sight to make thee sport: but who tells thee these
stories? prethee <font>Kate</font> tell me,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must excuse me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not urge but pray believe no more such
<pagebreak id="6" />
stories, for by my faith and troth I love thee, and
if my year was up once, thou would find it so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well <font>Iohn</font> I must believe you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But dost thou forgive me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ka.</nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pretty heart thou hast no gall in thee, dost
thou love me too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sweet soul give me thy hand, and say after
me these few words. I love thee <font>John</font> most 
dearly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I love thee John most dearly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pretty soul, and dost thou truly? methinks
those words do sound so sweetly, that I must
needs kiss thee for them; lets go somewhere and
drink, and then we will talk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether should we go?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's very good drink at the Kings Arms
and this is Holy day, so that we need not fear
Anger for staying, let's go in,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What you will <font>Iohn</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any room here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray walk in Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bring hither some of your newest Cakes,
and a pot of your best Ale.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have the best Sir,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come honey, prethee eat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank you <font>Iohn</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her's to thee my dear, and a fart for all the
<pagebreak id="7" />
wanton Whores, thou shalt know I love thee,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shall be the sign thereof.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will marry thee my dear when my year is
up. if thou wilt consent, what sayest thou, speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must consider of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what thinkest thou, is it not the best way
to end all jealousies, and to make all Rascals and
Sluts to leave their talking.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it must be so at last, but truly you
cannot blame me for believing these reports, when
in a fortnight or more I have not seen you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Poor heart I would see thee oftner, but that
my Master would think I negliected his business,
and besides, there is such flickering and laughing
amongst the maids and children at your house
when I come, as I am quite ashamed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ashamed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not of thee my Birds-ny, and sometimes
I meet your Mistriss and then I sneak, &amp; I could
run into an auger hole if possible,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You being so bashful <font>Iohn</font> , I wonder how
you came first to woe me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh thy pretty charming eyes would force
any man to speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't flatter me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou knowest <font>I</font> don't, let's talk now to the 
purpose, and observe the old proverb.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's that John.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blessed is the woeing, that is not long a
<pagebreak id="8" />
doing, tis half a year since we begun, I think tis
time to make an end, is it not, prithee say true
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we know how to live.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do other folks live.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They bethink them before they marry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So will we, lets spend this day in contriving
for we shall never have the like opportunity again,
come lets walk a little if it be not too cold.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Better being in the house, for I think it
will rain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What thou wilt my sweet love, well dear heart
how shall we live, what will thy friends give thee
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O are you come to that, I thought you
would have taken me for love onely, and now it is
what have you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be not angry my dear, if thou hast not a
smock to thy back I would have thee, but in
knowing what each other hath, we shall know the
better how to improve it, do thou the same by me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly I have but ten pounds my father left
me, and that is in my Uncle Hodge's hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis sure I hope.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You need not doubt that, for he cannot keep
it from me, and five pound I have gathered since I
came to service, besides my Mistress owes me above
half a years wages.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O what a happy man shall I be, what a
good housewife thou hast been, thou hast good
cloathes too.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They will serve.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now <font>Kate</font> I will tell thee what I have, my
Father gave me ten pounds when I came from
him, and told me as I did improve that, he would
give me more, and with my Masters leave, I have
imployed it in his Mault-house, and have encreased
it; besides my master doth owe me my wages ever
since I came to him, he would not let me have it
for fear I should play the ill husband, and if I
please him, I know he will give me somthing when
I marry, and so will thy Mistriss, will she not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope so too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now for the best advantage, thy stock and
mine together, will amount to something; and
when we have concluded our marriage day, ile try
if my Master will let me have a little house and
ground thou knowest hard by <font>William Jacksons</font> ,
that will make a great house for us,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And a great Rent too, what should we do
with such a house, one Room will serve our turn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay to sleep in my dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what trade do you intend to drive?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give me leave and ile tell thee, and if thou
wilt help me a little, it will be the better, for two
heads are better than one, we must not take care
only for sleeping places, but a place to get mony in.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, that pleases me well to be getting of
Money, for I love it dearly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have almost broke my Brains with
<pagebreak id="10" />
studying &amp; contriving, but now I think I have hit ont.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis long coming out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If my master will let me have the house we
will brue good Ale, and we will have mault of our
own, for we'l keep a stock going in my Master's
Mault-house, with his leave, and there is pasture
enough to keep two beasts, and conveniences for
hogs and poultery, so thou mayest have all things
about thee, and keep a maid and live like a Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This will be brave indeed John, but what
shall we do with our Ale.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sell it my sweet one; let me see, there are
eight rooms in the house besides the Cellar, and
with a little painting and a few benches it will be
very fine, &amp; a handsome sign to draw in company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shall that be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The three fair maids, I think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not for a hundred pound I would not have
such a sign.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why prithee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why man they'd think surely we kept a
bawdy house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then shall we have, do you tell me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The three Fidlers I think and then they will
judge they may have Musick.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast pleased me mightily, but how
dost like my motion and contrivance,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well indeed, I thought you had not had
so much in you.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh ho <font>Katy</font> , though I am but a Clown, I
am no fool I think, but how dost thou like such an
imployment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well truly if it will not make thee an ill
Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou pretty Pig-ny thou, that word
sounds so finly out of thy mouth, that I must needs
kiss thee for it; be sure my dear I shall mind my
business and when I have drink always by me <font>I</font>
shall not desire it, only to drink a cup with thee in
the morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That will please me, for I love Ale very well
but good lack, I shall grow as fat as a bear with
drinking every day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter for that, thou wilt be the better
to kiss.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like all very well, but pray be speedy, least
another take it before you, and get a License, for
time runs away apace.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> know he will not deny me to morrow I
will move it to him &amp; bring thee word, but a
pescods ont, I cant abide to be seen at your house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cannot you meet me in the fields when I am
milking my Kine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will, that's well thought on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well now, we had as good make an end since
we have begun, what shall we make a money dinner
or not, that would help us well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry would it: dost think thy mistriss will
not let thee keep our Wedding at her house:
<pagebreak id="12" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I doubt not but she will, for I have been a
good servant to her though I say it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she will do so, it will be a grace and
advantage to us, and then I will invite my master &amp;
his Family, wilt thou then resolve to marry with 
me at Easter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It had as good be done and past, since it must
be done at last.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think so too, but how shall we do to lay
out the money for all things, for if we let the stock
go, I shall fear the gathering of it together again
but now I think ont, my credit is good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shall we do for Clothes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In troth <font>Kate</font> we will save that money,
those that we have will serve very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think so too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Only I will have a hat &amp; a Gold ring for thee
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who shall we bid to our Wedding.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All who we can think of, the more the merrier
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Musick shall we have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will have old <font>Rowly</font> and his company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They will make a roaring noise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And they will sing well too, to please the
young people; why dost laugh, does the thoughts
of it please thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I laugh to think how the young men will
turn the Lasses about in dancing, and how they will
buss them, methinks I see them already, but good
lack how shall I do to behave my self at that time
<pagebreak id="13" />
amongst so many; I shall be so ashamed I shant
know what to do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why priethee all people will adore thee that
day, and I shall be woundy proud of thee my Dear
to see thee sit as a Virgin-Bride, and I shall wait
upon thee too that same day, as it is my duty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that the fashion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my dear, hast thou never observed it
at weddings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall observe my own the more, but you
must not look towards me, for then I shall laugh
and that will shame me quite.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my dear a smile sometimes will do well
they'l think there's the more love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must I dance too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay pretty one, every body will strive to
dance with the Bride.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ide rather dance with thee John, than with
them all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So thou shalt my dear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Favours shall we give.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Red and blew I think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They will look gloriously, but all this while
who shall lead us to Church.

thee, and <font>Mary Tomkins</font> and <font>Bess Ruglas</font> shall
lead me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shant be able to go along the street, the
folk will so look at me.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter for their looking, 'ile warrant

same condition, who are not married already.

speak out that I shant know what to do with my self
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou must not be ashamed my dear, for it is
an honour to be a bride.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who shall be my Father to give me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou mayest ask <font>Jack Wheeler</font> , but I know
he had rather had thee himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh fie no, I will not ask him, he will take it
for an affront, I will rather ask old father <font>Randol</font> 
for he us'd to call me Daughter, and he will take it
kindly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Does it not make you ashamed to talk of these
things.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No I promise thee, I am proud of it, and so
art thou I believe, but that thou wilt not confess it

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In our own house that will be the best, and
therefore we must furnish it before, and lay in
some Ale, that we may be able to invite all the
wedding people to drink with us, and then we
sholl have good handsel indeed, and we will also
have a good Gammon of Bacon, and that will
make the drink go down merrily.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What maid shall we have?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will have a lusty wench, who may be
able to do our work, for fourty shillings the year
we may have one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I think we have thought of every thing
let's consider what time of the day it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVill thy Mistriss chide thee thinkst thou
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay and your Master too I believe if you do
not make haste home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat's a Clock, not above six I trow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Loves Dial goes but slow, I believe it is six
at the least, and then I shall be hanged.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas poor thing hanged, call me and I will
cut the Rope, what humors thy mistriss of, she
looks frowningly.
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly she is very good when she is pleased,
but she is develish peevish, she will fret and fume
sometimes for a very small matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: sI</comment> that the goodness, the        
Devil's good when
pleas'd, my Master he is angry too, but faith I fit
him for it, for when he begins to chide, I get me
out of doors, and come no more in that night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Youl serve me so I fear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay if you chide.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In troth I shall chide you if you come home
drunk, for ime sure they that love drinking love
whoring.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou shalt see what a husband 'ile be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would I could once, but now <font>John</font> I sit 
upon thorns, my Mistriss will be very angry with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So shall <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS SPACE HERE FOR &quot;I&quot;</comment>     
if you go yet, you must learn to
humour me now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dont hold my hand for I must be gone, you
cannot tell how humorsome she is, there chanc'd to be
but one hair in the pudding tother day at table, but
she did maunder, I thought she would never have
been quiet. Ile tell you a good jest above a week ago
she sent me to the Shoomaker for her new shooes, and
because she had them not, she made a hundred wry
faces at me, and sate fleering in her Looking-glass
an hour or more, that I could not forbear laughing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is horrible proud I believe, pox on her
humour I am humoursome too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray dont hold me I must be gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, come over boots over shooes, we'd
<pagebreak id="17" />
as good make up the day now, &amp; then one chiding
will serve for all, I look for a storm too, but my
Master is pretty good natur'd if he ask me where
I have been, ile be plain to him, and tell him I have
been with thee, ay, and bid him to our wedding
too, he loves mirth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not think how impatient I am with
staying Oh my Mistriss, my Mistriss.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have a Master shortly worth ten
of her, come stay a little <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: alittle</comment> , i'le sing thee 
a fine Song 
of my own making.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never knew you were a Poet before, let me
hear it quickly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Love makes me very eloquent, I never had
so much wit, as since I met with thee, I think it
comes from thee to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps so too, for i'm sure I never had so
little as since I met with you, I did wonder what was
become of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast enough still methinks, and that
thou hast lent me, I will improve it if I can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kate.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's your song then I shall judge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come sweet Duck, I will begin, I made it
the other day as I was in the Mault-house, &amp; when
I had done turning the Mault, I sat down and
repeated it, and played the tune on my Flagellet, &amp;
methought it went so sweetly, it ravisht me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would I could hear it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hum, hum, hum.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'd best wet your whistle first, for I see thy
Pipes are stopt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll take thy councel, hers to thee <font>Katy</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank you <font>John</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS ONLY FIRST   
LETTER OF John IN DIFFERENT FONT</comment> now pray begin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SONG OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O brave <font>John</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS ONLY FIRST       
LETTER OF John IN DIFFERENT FONT</comment> I see you think on me when you
do not see me, I did not think indeed you had been so
good a Schollar pray how long did you go to School.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not long, for I had more mind to go to plow
and look after my Fathers Horses, then to learn
my book, yet I was pretty apt, for by that time I
was fourteen I could read the Psalter pretty well
now <font>Katy</font> prethee do thou sing a song, and then
we will part for this time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What song shall I sing, I know not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Any one will be sweet from thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will not laugh at me, I will sing as well as I
can, I promise you I was counted good at singing
once but now I have forgot, love hath spoiled my voice
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Love mends it, prethee begin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SONG OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="20" />
There's all <font>John</font> how do you like it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, a kind Lass, i'le warrant her, well
I will not serve thee so, ile stay &amp; live with my love
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well let's go, in troth we shall go near to spoil
our wedding with this dayes work, for certainly we
shall both be soundly chidden.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my part I will begin with my master first
and tell him that I am coming into the honourable
estate of Matrimony, and that I hope he will grace
my VVedding with his company, &amp; if he storm at
me, I will desire him to remember his own
condition, &amp; if it be an evil thing to marry. I wil ask him
<pagebreak id="21" />
why his worship did set me such an example? for
he loved his wife so well that he doth adore the
very thoughts of her, and so talks of her, that he
made me almost mad to know what a wife was,
sure some hidden treasure is in a married life,
because every one strives to be of that rank.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I</font> believe so too, or else so many would not
desire it, Maids are only made much of by young men,
and if they be too kind they are laught at, but
married folks are accepted of in all company; and
invited to Weddings, Christnings, Gossipings,
Burials, &amp; to all merry meetings, which please me well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope they shall come a Gossiping to thee
shortly, and by that time I shall look soberly, and
bid the women welcome, what dost blush at it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It would make one blush to hear you talk?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, what wilt thou say to thy Mistriss?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My best way is to let her chide so long as she
pleases, and then ile confess my self in a fault &amp; ask
pardon, and then she will be pleased again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou hast a great deal of patience, I
commend thee for it, I hope thou wilt have some with
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must bear with one another, but if we
displease a Master or Mistriss, some are so crabed,
they will turn one out of doors, but if we be angry
one with another, we must be friends again, when my
Mistriss hath spoken all her mind, and is again in a
good humour, then I will make her my Councellour
<pagebreak id="22" />
and bid her to my Wedding, for she loves one should
trust her with secrets: the mischief is, I know not
how to go in first of all, had I but made a bargain 
I would not care, and now it is dark, I fear I shall
lose my way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well I will go with thee now, I cannot be
seen, and if she falls out foul with thee, call me and
ile take thy part, for thou shalt not be a slave to
her, no marry shalt thou not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If goody <font>Sho</font> hath not milkt my kine, it will
be worse, I wish she have, I would have bid her do
so if I had known I should have staid so long.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let's reckon what is to pay; let me see, we
have had three Cakes and four Pots of Ale, and
two Pipes of Tobacco, that's fifteen pence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must not use to spend so much in an
Ale-house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The best bargains are made there &amp; I hope
thee and I have made a good one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should be sorry else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would it were sealed once.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All in good time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Host good buy to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are welcome Sir,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give me thy hand prethee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My heart doth ake I know not what to do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pluck it up woman do not fear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would I were out of this slavery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis but four months and thou shalt, how
<pagebreak id="23" />
pleasant it is to walk with thee, though in the dark.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pitty your journey home, but I shall never
trouble you again for such another, well now <font>John</font> 
good buy to you, remember all things, order your
matter wisely, and not forget to send me word, for
I shall long to hear, I shall look for you every minute
to morrow in the evening, and if you deceive me,
you will break my heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fear not, if it Rains Cats and Dogs I will come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's true love indeed, I shall go about my
work so merrily if my Mistriss will but forgive me
this one fault, that I shall not feel the ground I go
on, oh what it is to be pleased, God be with you good
<font>John</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God be with you sweet one, my Duck my
dear, my Pig's-ny, when we do meet to morrow,
we will conclude all more firmly; here, take my
heart and a hundred kisses besides with it, and keep
them till I see thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ka.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  I cannot see neither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jo.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are only felt my dear, once more, far
thee well, heavens favour me as I prove true to
thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Kate speaks to her self as she goes home;</nonSpeech><dialogue> My
poor <font>John</font> , how loving has he been to me this day; I
am heartily sorry I snapt him up so, surely he was
innocent, must I be married suddenly and be called
goody <font>Lawrence</font> . I shall then hardly know my self,
my dear <font>Iohn</font> , what a many pretty charming words
<pagebreak id="24" />
he had for me, &amp; what a fine song he made 
himself of me, surely I shall not sleep till I do hear
how our business goes forward, neither do I
beleive will he, for love is a terrible thing.
   It wounds the heart it breaks the brain,
   It makes one always live in pain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>John</font> talkes to himself as he goes,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what a joyful
day this hath been; If I could but recount every
days action to be so good, surely then I should,
without doubt, get to Heaven in a short space, let
me but reckon up what I have done to day; I have
seen my dear love to day, &amp; made my peace with
her, and have gotten her consent to marry, and we
have appointed the very time, and have contrived
all things to my hearts content, that I could even
leap for joy, poor heart, she was almost jealous of
me, but now I have fully satisfied her, and shortly
all fears will vanish away from us, I will have a
special care for the future how to order things, &amp;
surely be with her to morrow in the evening, for
fear I should anger her again, for she doth look
so pretily when she smiles, that it is a thousand
pitties that ever she should be displeased any more.
   Well my dear <font>Katy</font> , I must think on my master
now, and study what to say to him for my long
absence from him, therefore my dear <font>Katy</font> I must
forbear the sweet thoughts of thee for a season.
   Farewell a while, to thee my Love adieu,
   To thee, dear <font>Kate</font> , I will for ay prove true.
