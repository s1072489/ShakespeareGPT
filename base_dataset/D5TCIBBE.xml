<comment type="compiler">THE CASE HAVING BEEN STATED, THE PLAINTIFF'S COUNCIL CALL THEIR 
WITNESSES TO PROVE THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFF AND HIS WIFE.</comment> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Plaintiff's Attorney then named Mr</font>
Cibber, <font>the Plaintiff's Father, who being
present in Court, was sworn. His Evidence was
in Substance as follows</font> :</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know of the Plaintiff's being
married to his present Wife?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not at the Marriage, but
I am as well convinced that they were married,
as that I my self was married. I was against
the Match.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why were you against the Match?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because She had no Fortune.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they at first live happily together?
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did live happy, very
happy, much happier than I expected; for I was
averse to the Match.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did they live thus happily
together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About three Years; within that
Time they had two Children, which are both
dead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr <font>Cibber</font> , the Plaintiff, during that
time support her well and liberally, as became
an affectionate Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did, even to Profusion. I
often admonished him about it; and advised
him to retrench his Expences; for I thought
them a good deal too large for his Condition,
or what he was able to afford. He made her
several valuable Presents of Rings and Jewels.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not Mrs. <font>Cibber</font> a good Actress? and
how did she become so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they married She was a
Singer, but there were better Voices. I thought
her Voice not the best; and if not best 'tis
nothing. I thought it might possibly do
better for speaking. I asked her Husband if he
had ever heard her attempt to speak a Part?
he said he had; and that she did it very
prettily. I tried her, and was much surprized to
find her do it so very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not her Husband take Pains to
instruct her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe I was the Person who
chiefly instructed her; I spent a good deal of
<pagebreak id="9" />
Time, and took great Delight in it: for she was
very capable of receiving Instruction. In Forty
Years Experience that I have known the Stage,
I never knew a Woman at the beginning so
capable of the Business, or improve so fast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you first here of any
Disagreement in the Family?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Cibber.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soon after he came from <font>France</font> ;
about last <font>April</font> .

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr</font> Fleetwood, <font>Master of</font> Drury-lane
<font>Play-house was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Do you know the Plaintiff's Wife?
Is she a good Player.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I think her a good
Player for her Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What Salary did you give her? What
Advantages did she bring to her Husband?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She played three Seasons:
For the first, her Salary was an hundred Pounds,
and she had a Benefit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What was that Benefit worth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't be particular, because
I have not looked into the Accounts on this
Occasion. If I had known I should have been
examined to this, I could have been particular.
I believe it might be about a hundred Pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Sir, the second Year?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The second Year, Sir, I gave
her two hundred Pounds Salary, and she had a
Benefit.
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What was that Benefit worth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That must have been a good
deal better than an hundred Pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then the third Year?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her Salary the third Year was
two hundred Pound, and she had a Benefit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What was that worth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it must have been
worth an hundred and fifty Pound; for she
grew much in the Favour of the Town, and
'twas a very good Benefit.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Note, <font>The Examination to these Matters
was at first opposed by the Defendant's
Council, as not being supported by the
Declaration; but the Plaintiff's Council
insisted, that it being laid in the
Declaration, that by the Means there alledged
the Plaintiff</font> had lost the Assistance of
his Wife, <font>he had a Right to prove the
Loss he sustained by the Defendant's
taking her off the Stage, and the</font>
Quantum <font>of that Loss. And of that Opinion
was the Court: so Mr</font> Fleetwood <font>was 
examined as above. The Defendant's
Council insisted that nothing here
appeared that the Defendant had taken her off
the Stage, and they Cross-Examined
Mr</font> Fleetwood.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, how comes it that Mrs <font>Cibber</font> does
not play this Season?
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because we could not agree
upon the Terms. I would not come up to her
Terms.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What were her Terms?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She insisted to have as good
Salary as any Woman in the House; and the
first Benefit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps she deserves as much; is she not
as good a Player as any in the House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Fleetwood.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say that, I can't
pretend to determine that. I have got more
Money by Mrs <font>Clive</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr</font> Quin, <font>Mr</font> Johnson, <font>and some others
were called for this Purpose; but the Court was
of Opinion 'twas now proper for the Plaintiff's
Council to establish their principal Fact</font> .</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Mrs</font> Hayes <font>was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs <font>Hayes</font> , pray give my Lord and the
Jury an Account of the Defendant's and Mrs
<font>Cibber's</font> coming to your House. Do you know
Mrs <font>Hopson</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, it was just this Day
Twelve-month, the fifth of <font>December</font> , that
Mrs <font>Hopson</font> came into my Lodgings. I live in
<font>Blue-cross-street, Leicester-fields</font> ; on the
<font>Saturday</font> Mrs <font>Hopson</font> came to my House and took
my Lodgings; she beat them down as low as
she could, for she said she was a single
Woman, and should give but very little Trouble,
and had no body to come after her but a
<pagebreak id="12" />
Gentleman and Gentlewoman <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Gantlewoman</comment> that would    
come
to see her sometimes. She had the Lodgings
for seven Shillings a Week; two Rooms on the
first Floor; there was a Bed in each of them;
one of the Beds was a Turn-up Bed. She was
to come in on <font>Sunday</font> , but she sent me Word
that she should not come in 'till <font>Monday</font> , and
on <font>Monday</font> , the fifth of <font>December</font> , she came in
a Hackney-Coach, and some Boxes and Things
with her. On <font>Sunday</font> in the Evening a young
Gentleman, whom I afterwards knew to be
Mr <font>Sloper</font> , called and asked if Mrs <font>Hopson</font> had
not taken the Lodgings, and whether she
was come: We told him she had taken the 
Lodgings, but that she had sent Word that she
should not come till <font>Monday</font> . She lay there on
<font>Monday</font> Night. Neither Mrs <font>Cibber</font> nor Mr
<font>Sloper</font> came that Day, but they came soon
after, I think 'twas on <font>Tuesday</font> , and they supped
together, and went away between eleven and
twelve o'Clock; Mrs <font>Hopson</font> sat up, and let
them out, and locked the Door after them.
They often came in the Space of six Weeks
that Mrs <font>Hopson</font> had the Lodgings: I believe
near Twenty Times. They did not come
together, but dropping in one after the other.
They sometimes dined, but most commonly
supped there. Mrs <font>Hopson</font> used to leave them
together every Time they came; sometimes an
Hour, sometimes two or three Hours at a time.
She often made Errants to go out to buy 
something; and sometimes sat two Hours at a time
<pagebreak id="13" />
below Stairs with me, while they were above
together. They stay'd sometimes till One or
Two o'Clock in the Morning; and how they
went away I cannot tell, for I was in Bed at
these Times, but I believe they usually went
in Chairs or Coaches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When they were thus left alone, did
they use to fasten the Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, the Door used to be fast?
Mrs <font>Hopson</font> used to go and knock at it, and
they let her in; and sometimes she could not
get in, and use to come down Stairs again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How did you know they were Mr <font>Sloper</font>
and Mrs <font>Cibber</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was an Acquaintance of
mine at my House one Day, when Mrs
<font>Hopson</font> came down Stairs to me; one Mr <font>Rowe</font> ,
and he knew Mrs <font>Hopson</font> ; <font>How do you do
Mrs Hopson</font> ? said he. So after she was gone,
I asked him who Mrs <font>Hopson</font> was, and he told
me she was Mrs <font>Cibber's</font> Maid; so I gave
her Warning, and let my Lodgings to another;
for I did not like their coming. Mrs <font>Hopson</font> did
not usually lye there o'Nights, except when they
had been there in the Evening; but on those
Nights she did lie there. One Day after I
gave Warning, Mr <font>Sloper</font> was in a great
Passion above Stairs at something, and Mrs <font>Hopson</font>
came to me, <font>You have made a fine Kettle of
Fish of it</font> , says she. I did not know what she
meant by her Kettle of Fish. <font>What Fish do you
mean</font> ? says I. <font>Why there</font> , says she <font>you have been
<pagebreak id="14" />
talking of Matters, and he's stark mad at it
above Stairs</font> . She would have kept the
Lodgings; but I chose not. I let them to another,
and so they went away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr <font>Cibber</font> ever call at your House,
and talk with you about them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs <font>Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, about five or six Months
ago, he came and asked me, if Mrs <font>Hopson's</font> had
not lodged there? I told him she had. He
asked who came to see her, and I described
them, both by their Clothes and their Persons;
so he said no more, and went away.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr</font> Hayes <font>sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, give an Account of Mrs <font>Hopson's</font>
lodging at your House, and who came to see
her, and what happened, <font>&amp;c.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When Mrs <font>Hopson</font> had my
Lodgings, Mr <font>Sloper</font> and Mrs <font>Cibber</font> used to
come often to her, and she used to leave them
together two or three Hours at a Time. They
used to go away at one, two, or three o'Clock
in the Morning, in Coaches or in Chairs. I
have a Closet on the same Floor, adjoining
to the Room where they used to sit; I bored
Holes through the Wainscoat, and could see
them very plain. He used to kiss her, and take
her on his Lap. On the 22d Day of
<font>December</font> I was looking through; he took her on his
Knee, lifted up her Clothes, and took down
his Breeches, and took his privy Member and
<pagebreak id="15" />
put it in his Hand, and put it between her
Legs. On the 12th Day of <font>January</font> , I was
lock'd up in the Closet at one o'Clock in the
Afternoon; and he came first, and he was
angry, because she was not come, and he sent
Mrs <font>Hopson</font> for her. In about two Hours she
came. Mrs <font>Hopson</font> went away, and left them
alone: So he spoke something to her in an angry
way about Mr <font>Fleetwood</font> ; she said she would
take away her Brother from his House, and
that she did not value Mr <font>Fleetwood</font> . He and
she grew Friends again; they made it up, and
he took her upon his Lap, took up her Clothes,
took down his Breeches, and put his
privy Member between her Legs. I stayed there
longer. Between five and six in the Evening
he let down the Turn-up Bed softly, she laid
herself upon it, upon her Back, and pulled up
her Clothes; her Body was bare. He
unbuttoned his Clothes, hung his Bag-wig upon a
Sconce, let down his Breeches, took his privy
Member in his Hand, and lay down upon her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Hereupon some further Questions offered as
the Fact, his Lordship interposed to this
Effect; <font>there is no occasion to be more particular;
we are not trying a Rape</font> . However the 
Witness did say there was a Criminal Conversation,
and being a Foreigner, he express'd himself as
much by Gestures, as by Words.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was their Chamber Lock'd?
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, it was fastened with a
Screw. The Holes are there to be seen in the
Wainscoat and the Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did that Screw belong to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was Mrs <font>Hopson's</font> .
I have seen it lying in the Chamber Window.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How did you know who they were?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Hayes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr <font>Rowe</font> was one Day at our
House, and he spoke to Mrs <font>Hopson</font> ; and
afterwards he said, she was Mrs <font>Cibber's</font> Maid.
Besides I dogged them both Home in their
Chairs: Her Chair carried her to Mr <font>Cibber's</font>
House, Number 12, in little <font>Wild-Court</font> , and
his Chair went to his Father's House in St
<font>James's Place</font> . After he was gone into the
House, I ask'd the Chairmen <font>whose House
that was</font> ? and they told me <font>old Mr Sloper's</font> .
I had often seen him at the <font>Tennis-Court</font> , and
knew his Name there.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr</font> Rowe <font>was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   I was one Day at Mr <font>Hayes's</font> , and Mrs
<font>Hopson</font> came in, I asked how she did? I had
known her for a good many Years before; and
the last time I had seen her, I had been told
she lived with Mr <font>Cibber</font> . I believe I told Mr
<font>Hayes</font> so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Juryman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord we would beg Leave
to call back the last Witness <font>Mr Hayes</font> to
ask him this Question? Why he took the
Pains to Dog Mr <font>Sloper's</font> Chair, at that time
<pagebreak id="17" />
of Night, to learn who he was, when he had
known him before at the <font>Tennis-Court</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Hayes</font> being called in again, and the
Question put to him; he answered to this
Purpose?</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   As Mr <font>Sloper</font> and Mrs <font>Cibber</font> came into my
House, I knew them both, because I had
seen him at the <font>Tennis-Court</font> , and her on the
Stage; but to be the more certain, I went and
followed their Chairs, as I told you.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr</font> Carter <font>was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Give an Account of Mr <font>Cibber</font> and Mrs
<font>Cibber's</font> Lodging at your House in <font>March</font> last,
and whether Mr <font>Sloper</font> resorted there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, on the Second of <font>March</font>
Mrs <font>Cibber</font> took the Lodgings, I believe for
them all; there were three Beds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any thing of Mr
<font>Cibber's</font> going to <font>France</font> , and whether Mr <font>Sloper</font>
came there during his Abscence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Mr <font>Cibber</font> went to <font>France</font> soon
after, and Mr <font>Sloper</font> did lodge there part of the
time while he was abscent; and he lodged there
again soon after Mr <font>Cibber</font> came back; and there
was a Lodging taken for Mr <font>Cibber</font> , at <font>Blue-Green</font> ,
about a Mile and a Half from <font>Kensington</font> , and
after Mr <font>Cibber</font> , Mrs <font>Cibber</font> , and Mr <font>Sloper</font> had
supped together, Mr <font>Cibber</font> had a Man with a
Lanthorn and Candle, between Nine and Ten
o'Clock at Night, to light him to <font>Blue-Green</font> .
<pagebreak id="18" />
He came back to Breakfast next Morning, and
every Morning; and they Dined and
sometimes Supped together; and he went to
<font>Blue-Green</font> at Night; and Mr <font>Sloper</font> , and Mrs
<font>Cibber</font> lay at my House, but I do not know
what Beds they lay in. When Mr <font>Sloper</font> went
away from my House, back to <font>London</font> , Mrs
<font>Cibber</font> left <font>Blue-Green</font> , and came and lay at
my House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who bore the Expences of their
Housekeeping.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr <font>Sloper</font> did. Sometimes he
gave my Wife Money to lay out; at other
times, my Wife laid out what was necessary,
and made a Bill of it, and Mr <font>Sloper</font> paid it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr <font>Cibber</font> know this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, it was very often
before his Face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he offer to pay any thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Sir.

<nonSpeech>Anne Hopson <font>was sworn</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you lodge at Mr <font>Hayes's</font> about this
time Twelve-month?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I was then out of
Service. I had left Mr <font>Cibber's</font> ; and intended
to follow the Business of Mantua-making: I
was bred to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr <font>Sloper</font> and Mrs <font>Cibber</font> 
sometimes meet at your Lodgings?
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, they came to see me
pretty often. They desired they might come there,
and usually had a bit of something for Supper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> For what Purpose did they meet?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As they were Acquaintance,
to converse together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you use to go out, and leave them
alone together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I often had occasion to
go and buy something for Supper, or some Tea
and Sugar; and I had occasion to be below
Stairs to get Supper ready.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When you came up Stairs did you use to 
find the Chamber-door fast?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes it was so; and Mr
<font>Sloper</font> used to open it to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what could you believe was the
Occasion of these private Meetings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tell you all I know of
the Matter. I do not fear my Character; there
are enough in Court that will give me a very
good Character. It was about <font>March</font> was
Twelve-month that Mr <font>Sloper</font> used first to
come to our House to Mr <font>Cibber's</font> : The
Servants did not know who he was; but my
Master called him Mr <font>Benefit</font> , and used to
say he was a <font>Romp</font> , and a <font>good-natured Boy</font> . Mr
<font>Cibber</font> was then very bare of Money, and afraid
of his Creditors. I was very sorry for it; for
he owed me a good deal of Money, and does
so still. But one Day he told me: <font>Anne</font> , says
he, I shall have a good deal of Money soon,
<pagebreak id="27" />
and you shall have some. And I know he
soon after had a good deal of Money, and he
paid me five Guineas. That Summer we went
to lodge at <font>Kingston</font> , and Mr <font>Sloper</font> with us.
My Master used often to leave Mr <font>Sloper</font> and
my Mistress at Home, and go a Riding or
Abroad, some where or other. The rest of the
Servants wondered at it as well as I; but I
knew no Harm. They did not know Mr
<font>Sloper's</font> Name. My Master called him his Cousin
<font>Thompson</font> . Afterwards when they came to 
Town, I left the Service, and took that
Lodging. In last Spring, about <font>March</font> last, I lived
with them again. My Master took me aside,
and made me promise Secrecy concerning
something he was about to say to me. He told me
he was going to <font>France</font> : That there was an
Affair between Mr <font>Sloper</font> and his Wife: That
he was ruined for ever if it should be publickly
known. And he made me promise to live with
her till he should come back, that the rest of
the Servants might not know any thing of the
Matter. I promised him. They took
Lodgings at <font>Kensington</font> , and my Master went to
<font>France</font> in <font>March</font> or <font>April</font> . He was some
Weeks gone, and in his Abscence Mr <font>Sloper</font>
was commonly at the Lodgings at <font>Kensington</font> .
When my Master came back he was at a
Bagnio in <font>Goodman's Fields</font> , and sent Word to my
Mistress. Mr <font>Sloper</font> was not then at 
<font>Kensington</font> . My Mistress and I went to <font>Goodman's
Fields</font> in a Hackney Coach, and he came back
<pagebreak id="28" />
with us to <font>Kensington</font> . In our Return we
changed our Coach two or three times by the
Way, that he might not be discovered. She
told him, she expected Mr <font>Sloper</font> in a Day or
two. My Master said he would take a
Lodging when Mr <font>Sloper</font> came; or if there was no
time for that, he would go lie at some Inn in
the Town. Within two or three Days Mr 
<font>Sloper</font> came; and then Mr <font>Cibber</font> sent and took a
Lodging at <font>Blue-Green</font> , and after Supper about
nine or ten o'Clock he went there, with a Man
carrying a Lanthorn and Candle, and left Mrs
<font>Cibber</font> and Mr <font>Sloper</font> at the Lodgings at
<font>Kensington</font> . He came back to Breakfast next
morning, and dined, and I believe supped; and
so he did several Days, till Mr <font>Sloper</font> went
away; and then Mr <font>Cibber</font> paid off the
Lodgings at <font>Blue-Green</font> , and came to the
Lodgings in <font>Kensington</font> to his Wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you at <font>Burnham</font> with Mr <font>Cibber</font>
and his Wife, and Mr <font>Sloper</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, last Summer it was. They
three and I looked over the House; that they
might contrive in what Rooms to lie, and the
rest of the Servants know nothing of the Affair.
It was a large House, seven Rooms on a Floor.
Mr <font>Cibber's</font> Bedchamber and Mr <font>Sloper's</font> had a
Door opened between them. Mrs <font>Cibber</font> used
to undress herself in my Master's Room, and
leave her Clothes there, and put on a 
Bedgown, and take away one of the Pillows from
my Master's Bed, and go away to Mr <font>Sloper's</font>
<pagebreak id="29" />
Room; my Master used to shut the Door
after her, and say, <font>Good Night my Dear</font> ; and
sometimes he used to knock at their Door in a
morning, to call them up to Breakfast, and at
other Times he sent me to call them; and the
Pillow was brought back again; for my
Master's Bed was always made with the two
Pillows.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What became of Mrs <font>Cibber</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know. She went
away somewhere. I did not see her till two
or three Days afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you go down into the Country with
her afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, we went to <font>Reading</font> .
Mr <font>Sloper</font> met us at <font>Slough</font> , and there we
went into the <font>Reading</font> Coach, Mr <font>Sloper</font>
walked out some time before us, and the
Coach took him up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was Mrs <font>Cibber</font> afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anne Hopson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Reading</font> with Mr <font>Sloper</font> ,
till she came to Town about five Weeks ago?
<pagebreak id="30" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs</font> Carter, <font> (the Wife of a former Witness) was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>She gave in Substance the same Evidence
that her Husband did before; and that Mr
<font>Sloper</font> used to pay her the Money for
Housekeeping. That when the Lodging was taken
at <font>Blue-Green</font> , and upon her asking the
meaning of it, she had for Answer, 'twas because
Mr <font>Cibber</font> was a mean spirited Dog.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why would you keep such a House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs <font>Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought it no Business of mine
if the Husband consented, and was satisfied.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Jane Phillips <font>was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Give the Court, <font>&amp;c.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jane Philips.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I lived at <font>Burnham</font> , and
used to make the Beds. Mr <font>Cibber</font> and Mr 
<font>Sloper's</font> Beds. There were two Pillows on
Mr <font>Cibber's</font> Bed, and only one Pillow on
Mr <font>Sloper's</font> ; but there was the mark of only
one Person having lain in Mr <font>Cibber's</font> Bed
and of two in Mr <font>Sloper's</font> . The
Bed-chambers opened into each other: I never saw Mr
<font>Cibber</font> undress; nor do not know who brought
back the Pillow every morning.
