 <head>THE MANER OF THE ARRAIGNEMENT OF <font>WILLIAM PARRIE</font> THE
XXV. OF FEBRUARIE, 1584. AT WESTMINSTER, IN THE PLACE 
WHERE THE COURTE COMMONLY CALLED THE KINGS BENCH,
IS VSUALLY KEPT BY VERTUE OF HER MAIESTIES COMMISSION
OF OYER &amp; TERMINER, BEFORE <font>HENRIE L. HUNSDON</font>
GOUERNOUR OF BARWICKE, <font>SIR FRANCIS KNOLLES</font> KNIGHT, 
TREASORER OF THE QUEENES MAIESTIES HOUSHOLDE, <font>SIR IAMES
CROFT</font> KNIGHT, COMPTROLLER OF THE SAME HOUSHOLD, <font>SIR
CHRISTOPHER HATTON</font> KNIGHT, VICECHAMBERLAINE TO HER
MAIESTIE, <font>SIR CHRISTOPHER WRAY</font> KNIGHT, CHIEFE IUSTICE
OF ENGLANDE, <font>SIR GILBERTE GERRARD</font> KNIGHT, MASTER
OF THE ROLLES, <font>SIR EDMUND ANDERSON</font> KNIGHT, CHIEFE
IUSTICE OF THE COMMON PLEES, <font>SIR ROGER MANWOOD</font>
KNIGHT, CHIEFE BARRON OF THE ESCHEQUER, AND <font>SIR
THOMAS HENNAGE</font> KNIGHT, TREASORER OF THE CHAMBER.</head> 

<nonSpeech>First, three Proclamations for
silence were made according to
the vsuall course in such cases.
Then the Lieutenant was
commaunded to returne his precept,
which did so, and brought the
prysoner to the Barre, to whom
<font>Miles Sandes</font> Esquire, Clerke
of the Crowne sayde,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>William
Parrie</font> , hold vp thy hand, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and he did so. Then said y=e= Clerke
of the crowne,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art here indicted by the othes of xii.
good and lawful men of the Countie of Middlesex, before
<font>Sir Christopher Wray</font> Knight, and others which tooke the
Indictment by the name of <font>William Parry</font> late of
London Gentleman, otherwise called <font>William Parry</font> , late of
London Doctor of the lawe, for y=t= thou as a false traitor
against the most noble and Christian Prince, Queene
Elizabeth thy most gracious Soueraigne and liege
Ladie, not hauing the feare of God before thine eyes, nor
regarding thy due allegiance, but being seduced by the
<pagebreak id="28" />
instigation of the deuill, and intending to withdrawe and
extinguish the heartie loue and due obedience, which true
and faithfull Subiectes shoulde heare vnto the same our
Soueraigne Ladie, diddest at Westminster in the
Countie of Middlesex on the first day of Februarie, in the xxvi.
yeere of her Highnesse raigne, and at diuers other times
and places in the same Countie, maliciously, and
trayterously conspire and compasse, not onely to depriue and
depose the same our Soueraigne Ladie of her Royall
estate, title and dignitie, but also to bring her highnesse to
death and finall destruction, and sedition in the Realme
to make, and the gouernement thereof to subuert, and the
sincere religion of God established in her highnesse
dominions to alter &amp; subuert. And that, whereas thou <font>William
Parry</font> , by thy letters sent vnto <font>Gregorie</font> Bishoppe of
Rome, diddest signifie vnto the the same Bishoppe thy
purposes and intentions aforesayde, and thereby diddest pray
and require the same Bishoppe to giue thee absolution,
that thou afterwards, that is to say, the last day of March
in the xxvi. yeere aforesayde, diddest trayterously receiue
letters fro~ one called <font>Cardinall de Como</font> , directed vnto thee
<font>William Parry</font> , whereby the same Cardinall did signifie
vnto thee, that the Bishoppe of Rome had perused thy
letters, and allowed of thine intent, and that to that ende
hee had absolued thee of all thy sinnes, and by the same
letter did animate and stirre thee to proceede with thine
enterprise, and that thereupon, thou, the last day of August
in the xxvi. yeere aforesaide, at Saint Giles in the fieldes,
in y=e= same Countie of Middlesex, diddest trayterously
conferre with one <font>Edmunde Neuill</font> Esquire, vttering to him
all thy wicked and trayterous deuises, and then and there
diddest moue him to assist thee therin, &amp; to ioyne with thee
in those wicked treasons aforesayd, against y=e= peace of our
sayd Soueraigne Ladie the Queene, her Crowne &amp;
dignity: What sayest thou <font>William Parry</font> , art thou guilty of
these treasons whereof thou standest here indicted, or not
<pagebreak id="29" />
guiltie?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Parry</font> sayde,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Before I pleade not guiltie, or
confesse my selfe guiltie, I pray you giue me leaue to speake
a fewe words: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and with humbling himselfe, began in this
maner.</nonSpeech><dialogue> God saue the Queene Elizabeth, and God sende mee
grace to discharge my duetie to her, and send you home
in charitie. But touching the matters that I am indicted
of, some were in one place, and some in another, and done
so secretely, as none can see into them, except y=t= they had
eyes like vnto God, wherefore I will not lay my blood
vpon the Jurie, but doe minde to confesse the indictment.
It containeth but the parts that haue bene openly redde,
I pray you tel me? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Whereunto it was answered, that the
Indictment conteined the partes he had heard redde, and
no other: whereupon the Clarke of the Crowne saide
vnto <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Parry</font> , thou must answere directly to the
indictment, whether thou be guiltie or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then sayde <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I doe confesse that I am guiltie
of al that is therein co~tained: And further too, I desire not
life, but desire to die. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Unto which the clarke of y=e= Crowne
sayd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> If you confesse it, you must confesse it in maner and
fourme as it is comprised in the Indictment. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Whereunto
he sayd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I doe confesse it in maner and fourme as the same
is set downe, and all the circumstances thereof. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the
confession being recorded, the Queenes learned counsel
being readie to pray iudgement vpon the same confession,
Master Uicechamberlaine sayde,</nonSpeech><dialogue> These matters
contained in this indictment, and confessed by this man, are of
great importance: they touch the person of the Queenes
most excellent Maiestie in the highest degree, the very
state and weldoing of the whole common wealth, and the
trueth of Gods worde established in these her Maiesties
dominions, and the open demonstration of that
capitall enuie of the man of Rome, that hath set him selfe
against God and all godlinesse, all good Princes and good
gouernment, and against good men. Wherefore, I pray
<pagebreak id="30" />
you, for the satisfaction of this great multitude, let the
whole matter appeare, that euery one may see that the
matter of it selfe is as bad as y=e= indictment purposeth, &amp;
as he hath confessed. Wherto in respect y=t= the Justice of y=e=
Realme hath bin of late very impude~tly slau~dered, al
yeelded as a thing necessarie to satisfie the world in particular,
of y=t= which was but summarily comprised in y=e= indictme~t,
though in the lawe, his confession serued sufficiently to
haue proceeded thereupon vnto iudgement. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Whereupon
the Lordes and others the Commissioners, her Maiesties
learned Counsel, and <font>Parry</font> him self agreed, that <font>Parrys</font>
confession (taken the xi. and xiii. of Februarie 1584.
before the Lord of <font>Hunsdon</font> , master Uicechamberlaine, and
master Secretarie,) and Cardinall <font>de Como</font> his letters,
and <font>Parrys</font> letters to the Lord Treasourer and Lorde
Stewarde, should be openly read.
   And <font>Parry</font> , for the better satisfying of the people and
standers by, offered to reade them him selfe: but being
tolde that the order was, the Clerke of the Crowne should
reade them, it was so resolued of all partes. And then
master Uicechamberlaine caused to be shewed to <font>Parry</font>
his sayde confession, the Cardinals letter, and his owne
letter aforesayde, which after hee had particularly viewed
euery leafe thereof, he confessed, and sayde openly they
were the same.
   Then sayde master Uicechamberlaine,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Before we
proceede to shewe what he hath confessed, what say you, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd
he to <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is that which you haue confessed here true,
and did you confesse it freely and willingly of your selfe,
or was then any extort meanes vsed to drawe it from
you?
   Surely </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayde <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I made that confession freely
without any constraint, and that is all true, and more too:
for there is no treason that hath bene sithens the first yeere
of the Queene any way touching religion, sauing receipt
of <font> <foreign>Agnus dei</foreign> </font> , and perswading of others, wherein I haue
<pagebreak id="31" />
not much dealt, but I haue offended in it. And I haue
also deliuered mine opinion in writing, who ought to bee
successor to the crowne, </dialogue><nonSpeech>which he sayde to be treason also.
   Then his confession of the eleuenth and thirteenth of
Februarie, all of his owne hand writing, &amp; before
particularly sette downe, was openly, and distinctly red by the
Clarke of the crowne. And y=t= done, y=e= Cardinall <font>de Como</font>
his letter in Italian was deliuered vnto <font>Parrys</font> hande, by
the direction of Master Uicechamberlayne, which <font>Parry</font>
there perused, and openly affirmed to bee wholy of y=e=
Cardinals owne hand writing, and the seale to bee his owne
also, and to bee with a Cardinals hat on it: And himselfe
did openly read it in Italian, as before is set downe. And
the wordes bearing sence as it were written to a Bishop
or to a man of such degree, it was demaunded of him by
Master Uicechamberlayne, whether he had not taken the
degree of a Bishoppe: He said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> No: </dialogue><nonSpeech>But said at first, those
termes were proper to the degree hee had taken: and
after saide that the Cardinall did vouchsafe as of a fauour
to write so to him. Then the coppie of that letter in
English as before is also set downe, was in like maner openly
red by the Clarke of the Crowne, which <font>Parry</font> then
acknowledged to be truely translated.
   And thereupon was shewed vnto <font>Parry</font> his letter of y=e=
xviii. of Februarie, written to the Lord Treasorer, and the
Lord Steward: which he confessed to bee all of his owne
hand writing and was as before is set downe.
   These matters being redde openly for manifestation
of the matter, <font>Parry</font> prayed leaue to speake: whereto
Master Uicechamberlayne sayde,</nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will say any thing
for the better opening to the worlde of those your foule &amp;
horrible facts, speake on: but if you meane to make any
excuse of that which you haue confessed, which els would
haue bene and do stand proued against you, for my part, I
will not sit to heare you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then her Maiesties Attourney general stood vp &amp; said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<pagebreak id="32" />
It appeareth before you my Lords, y=t= this man hath bene
indicted &amp; arraigned of seuerall most haynous and
horrible treasons, and hath confessed them, which is before you
of recorde: wherefore there resteth no more to be done, but
for the Court to giue iudgement accordingly, which here
I require in the behalfe of the Queenes Maiestie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray you heare me for discharging
of my conscience. I will not goe about to excuse my selfe,
not to seeke to saue my life, I care not for it, you haue my
confession of recorde, that is enough for my life: And I
meane to vtter more, for which I were worthie to die. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And
sayde,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray you heere mee, in that I am to speake to
discharge my conscience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said Master Uicechamberlayne,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Parry</font> , then doe
thy duetie according to conscience, and vtter all that thou
canst say concerning those thy most wicked facts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> My cause is rare, singular &amp;
vnnaturall, conceyued at <font>Venice</font> , presented in generall wordes
to the Pope, vndertaken at <font>Paris</font> , commended &amp; allowed
of by his Holines, and was to haue bene executed in
England, if it had not bene preuented. Yea, I haue committed
many treasons, for I haue committed treason in being
reconciled, and treason in taking absolution. There hath
bene no Treason sithens the first yeere of the Queenes
reigne touching religion, but that I am guiltie of (except
for receiuing of <font> <foreign>Agnus Dei</foreign> </font> , and perswading as I haue
said:) And yet neuer intended to kil Queene <font>Elizabeth</font> . I
appeale to her owne knowledge and to my Lorde
Treasorers and Master Secretaries.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said my Lord <font>Hunsdon</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hast thou acknowledged
it so often, and so plainly in writing vnder thy hande, and
heere of recorde: and nowe, when thou shouldest haue thy
iudgement according to that which thou hast confessed
thy selfe guiltie of, doest thou goe backe againe, and deny
the effect of all? Howe can wee beleeue that thou nowe
sayest?
<pagebreak id="33" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said Master Vicechamberlaine,</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is absurd.
Thou hast not onely confessed generally, that thou wert
guilty according to the inditeme~t, which summarily, and
yet in expresse woordes doeth conteyne that thou haddest
trayterously compassed &amp; intended the death and
destruction of her Maiestie: but thou also saydest particularly
that thou wert guilty of euery of the Treasons conteined
therein, whereof the same was one in playne and expresse
letter set downe, and red vnto thee. Yea, thou saydest that
thou wert guilty of moe Treasons too besides these. And
diddest thou not vpon thy examination voluntaryly 
confesse, howe thou wast moued first thereunto by mislike of
thy state after thy departure out of the Realme, And that
thou diddest mislike her Maiestie for that shee had done
nothing for thee, Howe by wicked Papistes and Popish
bookes, thou wert perswaded that it was lawfull to kill
her Maiestie, Howe thou wert by reconciliation become
one of that wicked sort, that helde her Maiestie for
neyther lawfull Queene, nor Christian, And y=t= it was
meritorious to kill her? And diddest thou not signifie that thy
purpose to the Pope by letters, and receiuedst letters fro~
the Cardinall, howe he allowed of thyne intent, &amp; excited
thee to perfourme it, and thereupon diddest receiue
absolution? And diddest thou not conceyue it, promise it, vow
it, sweare it, and receyue the Sacrament that thou 
wouldest doe it? And diddest not thou thereupon affirme, that
thy vowes were in heauen, and thy letters and promyses 
on earth to bynde thee to doe it? And that whatsoeuer her
Maiestie would haue done for thee, coulde not haue 
remoued thee from that intention or purpose, vnlesse she would
haue desisted from dealing as shee hath done with the
Catholiques, as thou callest them? All this thou hast plainely
confessed: and I protest before this great assembly, thou
hast confessed it more playnely and in better sort, then my
memory will serue me to vtter: And sayest thou now, that
thou neuer mentest it?
<pagebreak id="34" />
   Ah </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayde <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> your honours knowe, howe my
Confession vpon myne examination was extorted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then both the Lord <font>Hunsdon</font> and Master
Uicechamberlayne affirmed, that there was no torture or threatning
wordes offered him.
   But <font>Parry</font> then sayde, that they tolde him, that if hee
would not confesse willingly, he should haue torture:
wherunto their honours answered, that they vsed not any spech
or worde of torture to him.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   You sayde, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd <font>Parry</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that you would proceede with
rigour against me, if I would not confesse it of my selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>But their honours expresly affirmed, that they vsed no
such words.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But I will tell thee, </dialogue><nonSpeech>sayd Master
Uicechamberlayne,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what we saide. I spake these words, If you will
willingly vtter the truth of your selfe, it may do you good,
and I wish you to doe so: If you will not, wee must then
proceede in ordinary course to take your examination.
Whereunto you answered, that you would tell the trueth
of your selfe. Was not this true? </dialogue><nonSpeech>which then hee yeelded
vnto.
   And hereunto, her Maiesties Attourney generall put
<font>Parry</font> in remembraunce what speeches hee vsed to the
Lieutenant of the Tower, the Queenes Maiesties
Seriant at Lawe, Master <font>Gaudie</font> , and the same Attourney
on Satterday y=e= twentieth of February last, at y=e= Tower,
vpon that hee was by them then examined by order from
y=e= Lords: which was, that he acknowledged he was most
myldely and fauourably dealt with, in all his
examinations, which he also at the Barre then acknowledged to be
true.
   Then Master Uicechamberlayne sayde, that</nonSpeech><dialogue> it was
wonder to see the magnanymitie of her Maiestie, which
after that thou haddest opened those trayterous practises
in sort as thou hast layd it downe in thy confession, was
neuerthelesse such, and so farre from all feare, as that shee
woulde not so much as acquaint any one of her highnes
<pagebreak id="35" />
priuie Counsel with it, to his knowledge, no not vntil
after this thine enterprise discouered &amp; made manifest. And 
besides that which thou hast set downe vnder thine owne
hande, thou diddest confesse, that thou haddest prepared
two Scottish Daggers, fit for such a purpose: and those
being disposed away by thee, thou diddest say that an
other would serue thy turne. And with all, <font>Parry</font> , diddest
thou not also confesse before vs howe wonderfully thou
wert appauled and perplexed vpon a suddaine at the
presence of her Maiestie at Hampton Court this last
Sommer, saying that thou diddest thinke thou then sawest in
her, the very likenes &amp; image of king Henry the seuenth?
And that therewith, and vpon some speeches vsed by her
Maiestie, thou diddest turne about and weepe bitterly to
thy selfe? And yet diddest call to mynde that thy vowes
were in heauen, thy letters and promises on earth, and
that therefore thou diddest say with thy selfe, that there
was no remedy but to do it? diddest thou not confesse this?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>the which he acknowledged.
   Then saide the lorde <font>Hunsdon</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sayest thou nowe, that
thou diddest neuer meane to kill the Queene? diddest thou
not confesse, that when thou diddest vtter this practise of
trecherie to her Maiestie, that thou diddest couer it with al
the skill thou haddest, and that it was done by thee, rather
to get credite and accesse thereby, then for any regard thou
haddest of her person? but in trueth thou diddest it, that
thereby thou mightest haue better oportunitie to performe
thy wicked enterprise. And wouldest thou haue runne into
such feare as thou diddest confesse that thou wert in, when
thou diddest vtter it, if thou haddest neuer meant it? what
reason canst thou shewe for my thy selfe? </dialogue><nonSpeech>With that he cryed
out in a furious maner,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I neuer meant to kill her: I will
lay my blood vpon Queene <font>Elizabeth</font> and you, before God
and the worlde: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and thereupon fell into a rage and euill
wordes with the Queenes Maiesties Attourney generall.
   Then said the lord <font>Hunsdon</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is but thy popish pride
<pagebreak id="36" />
and ostentation, which thou wouldest haue to be told to thy
fellowes of that faction, to make them belieue that thou
diest for poperie, when thou diest for most horrible and
dangerous treasons against her Maiestie, and thy whole
countrey. For thy laying of thy blood, it must lye on thine owne
head, as a iust reward of thy wickednesse. The lawes of the
Realme most iustly condemne thee to die out of thine
owne mouth, for the conspiring the destruction both of her
Maiestie, and of vs all: therefore thy blood be vpon thee,
neither her Maiestie, nor we at any time sought it, thy selfe
hast spilt it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he was asked what he coulde say, why iudgeme~t
of death ought not to be awarded against him.
   Whereto he said, he did see that he must die, because he
was not setled.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   What meanest thou by that, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said master
Uicechamberlaine.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> looke into your studie, and into    
your newe
bookes, and you shall finde what I meane.
   I protest </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said his honour) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I knowe not what thou
meanest: thou doest not well to vse such darke speaches,
vnlesse thou wouldest plainely vtter what thou meanest
thereby. </dialogue><nonSpeech>But he saide, he cared not for death, and that hee
would laye his blood amongst them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then spake the lorde chiefe Justice of England, being
required to giue the iudgement, and saide,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Parry</font> , you haue
bene much heard, and what you meane by being setled, I
knowe not, but I see you are so setled in poperie, that you
cannot settle your selfe to be a good subiect. But touching
that you should say to stay iudgement from being giuen
against you, your speaches must be of one of these kindes,
either to proue the Inditement (which you haue confessed
to be true) to be insufficient in lawe, or els to pleade
somewhat touching her Maiesties mercie, why Justice should
not be done of you. All other speaches wherein you haue
vsed great libertie, is more then by lawe you can aske.
These be the matters you must looke to, what say you to
<pagebreak id="37" />
them? </dialogue><nonSpeech>whereto he said nothing.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
