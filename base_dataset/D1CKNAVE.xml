<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Ethenwald.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ethen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The night drawes on, &amp; <font>Phoebus</font> is declining  
towards the West.
Now shepheards bear their flocks vnto the folds,
And wintred Oxen fodered in their stalles
Now leaue to feede, and gin to take their rest,
Blacke duskie cloudes inuyron round the globe,
And heauen is couered with a Sable robe,
Now am I come to doe the kings command.
To court a Wench &amp; win her for the King.
But if I lyke her well, I say no more,
Tis good to haue a hatch before the dore:
But first I will moue her Father to prefer
The earnest suit I haue in canuasing,
So may I see the Maid, woo, wed, I and bed her to:
Who is here? what ho.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Osricke.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Os.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Earl <font>Ethenwald</font> , welcome, how fares our friends 
at court
What cause constrains your Honor, that thus late
You visite vs, that dreame not of your comming?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ethenwald.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I am come vnlooked for, very true,
So is my cumming yet conceald from you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Osr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Honor shall repose you here to night,
And earlie as you please, begin your taske,
Tyme serues not now, come <font>Ethenwald</font> ,
As welcome as the King himselfe to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now <font>Ethenwald</font> , if Fortune fauour thee,
Thou maist prooue happie loue to <font>Alfrida</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Honestie, and the King disguised.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the place, and this the appointed tyme,
I know heel keep his word, for he thinks me his friend,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tell me <font>Honestie</font> , am I not well disguised.
<pagebreak id="C4V" />
Can any man discerne me by my lookes to be the King,
Take heed of that, for then our game is mard:
And hast thou promised him what reward he shall haue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush fear not you, for you neuer knew honest man
dissemble with his friend,
Though many friends dissemble with honest men:
But, my Lord, the cards be shufled, and here comes a knaue.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Conicatcher.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Conic.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis strange to see how men of our knowledge liue,
And how we are hated of the baser sort,
Because (forsooth) we liue vpon our wit:
But let the baser sort thinke as they will,
For he may best be termed a Gentleman,
That when all fayles, can liue vpon his wit.
And if all fayles, then haue I got a wench,
That cuts and deales, to maintaine my expence,
Now I vse her, as men vse sweetest flowers,
That while they are sweet and pleasant to the eie,
I doe regard them for their pleasant smell:
But when their cullour fades, and sent decaies,
I cast them off for men to trample on:
But to the purpose, here is the Gentleman
My honest friend did lately tell me of.
Sir, though I had another businesse of import,
That might haue hindred me for comming here,
Yet in regard I am loth to breake my word,
I haue set my other businesse cleane apart,
Because you should not iudge amisse of me,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Honest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I find you kind Sir, and your self shal see
How I will labour to requite <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: reqnite</comment> your curtesie 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: cnrtesie</comment> .
This is the honest man I told you of,
One that will doe you pleasure <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: pleasnre</comment> in the cause,
So be it you will content him for his paines.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Els God forbid, and good sir, thus it is,
I bought a farme of one that dwels here by,
And for an earnest gaue an hundred pound,
<pagebreak id="D1R" />
The rest was to be paid as sixe weekes past,
Now sir, I would haue you as witnesse,
That at my house you saw me pay three hundred pound,
And for your paines I will giue you a hundred pound:
Besides, I will stand your friend in what I may,
You heare the cause, what will your conscience serue you to do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conic.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How say you sir, my conscience, then you touch me,
I tell you sir, my conscience wil serue me to doe more than this:
Why, I haue bene a poste knight in <font>Westminster</font> this xii. year,
And sworne to that which no one els would venture on.
Why, I haue sworne against mine owne father for mony:
I haue sworne right or wrong any wayes for money,
whe~ I haue receiued <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: rereiued</comment> mony before witnes, I 
swore to the co~trary
And do you misdoubt me in so sleight a matter as this,
When I haue sworne against father, mother, and all my kin?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Honest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told you sir how resolute you should find him,
He doeth it without feare, I warrant you:
I think that in <font>London</font> you could not haue found a man so fit for 
your purpose,
I knew his father (sir) a man of honest reputation,
And one whose lyfe was witnesse to the lyfe he led,
He was a Bailiefe (sir) though I say't, but no Bayliefe that vsde    
deceit,
He had too good a conscience for that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Al the better for that, for it should seem by his 
behaueor 
That he hath had good bringing vp.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conicatc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed my father in his lyfe time was a man,
Giuen to the feare of God, and to vse much deuotion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, but he gaue nothing for Gods sake, except it were
hard words or blowes, and they had bene better kept then giuen:
But husht, here comes the Iudge.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Perin a Iudge, and Dunston a Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heare you sir, if you be in readines, here is the 
Iudge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conic.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sir, fear not, I warrant you, is that your     
aduersary?
What an old crust it is?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Honest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think the villaine hath a face hardened with  
steel,
He could neuer be so impudent els.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunston.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it please your Worship, this is the man,
<pagebreak id="D1V" />
That wrongfully would haue my farme from me,
Facing me downe that he hath paid me that,
Which he neuer offred, not I neuer receiued:
And this day he hath promised to make proofe,
That he hath paid me ful foure hundred pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And so I can, and heres my witnes to it,
That saw me when I paid the money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunston.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I am sure he wil not say it,
I neuer saw the man in all my lyfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conic.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No sir? but I saw you, and was a witnes,
When this Gentlema~ paid you three hundred pound
As the last paiment for the farme he bought.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Perin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But where was the money tendered?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Con.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At the Gentlemans house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You see father, this marchant wil be witnes
That he saw so much money tendred,
And you receiued it, being full satisfyed,
As the last payment for the farme he bought,
And if this marchant take his oath against you,
That seuen daies past he saw the mony tendered,
I must passe sentence then against you needs.
But wil you sweare on the bible this is true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coni.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sir, and to that intent I came hether,
For I wil neuer refuse to swear a truth while I liue
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunston.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet ere thou speake, vouchsafe to heare me     
speake,
Full three score Winters Gentle sir I haue past,
And age hath brought gray haires vpon my head.
Looke but vpon my face, and thou shalt see,
The perfect patterne of humilitie.
Thou man of worth, or citizen, what ere thou be,
Weigh but my charge, and then thou wilt not swear
I haue fiue sonnes, al pretie tender babes,
That liue vpon the farme that he would haue,
Twelue hundred sheep do feed vpon the plaines,
That yearlie bring a great increase to me, 
Besides a hundred Oxen fatly fed:
<pagebreak id="D2R" />
That euerie Winter feed within my stalles,
And twentie poore men liuing neere my house,
I daylie feed, and all vpon my Farme:
Go but among my neighbours, where I dwell,
And heare what good report they giue of me.
The poore man neuer yet went from my dore,
But to my power I did releeue his want:
I was no Farmer that inricht my selfe:
By raysing markets and oppressing poore,
But I haue sold my corne full manie tymes
At better rate, than I could wel affoord,
And all to help my needie brethren: 
Then ere thou swearst, cal al these things to mind,
And thou wilt weep, and leaue to sweare vntrueths,
Confusion to thy bodie and thy soule.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Perin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel, if thou be wel aduised, take thy oath,
But yet remember before whome thou swearest,
The God of trueth and perfect equitie,
Which will reuenge wrong to the innocent,
with thousand plagues and tortors worse than death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Con.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By the holy contents of this Byble,
And by that iust God, before whome I stand, I saw this man,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Peace, shamelesse villain, execrable wretch,
Monster of nature, degenerate miscreant,
Who euer knew or heard so vile an oath,
Vildly pronounc'd by such a damned slaue,
Haue I such monstrous vipers in my land,
That with their verie breaths infect the aire,
Say <font>Dunston</font> , hast thou euer heard the lyke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Liege, such lothsome weeds must needs infect  
the corne,
Such Cankers perish both the root and branch,
Vnlesse they be soone spied and weeded out:
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ile be the husbandman to mowe such Tares,
Here <font>Honesty</font> , let him be manacled:
And scar his forehead, that he may be knowne,
As <font>Cain</font> for murder, he for periurie.
<pagebreak id="D2V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conicat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech your Grace be good to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, you shal haue a cold yron clapt in your forehead,
A hot one I would say, you are a slaue indeede.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conicatcher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good <font>Honesty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hone.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good villaine, theres no help for you.            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Ethenwald alone.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Eth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My fancies thoughts, lyke the labouring Spyder,
That spreads her nets, to entrap the sillie Flie:
Or lyke the restlesse billowes of the seas,
That euer alter by the fleeting ayre,
Still houering past their woonted passions,
Makes me amazed in these extremities,
The King commands me on his embassage,
To <font>Osricks</font> daughter, beauteous <font>Alfrida</font> ,
The height and pride of all this bounding ill, 
To poste amaine, plead loue in his behalfe,
To court for him, and woo, and wed the mayd,
But haue you neuer heard that theame,
Deceit in loue is but a merriment,
To such as seeke a riuall to preuent,
Whether (distraught) romes my vnruly thoughts,
It is the King I cosen of his choise,
And he nil brook Earl <font>Ethenwald</font> should prooue
False to his Prince, especially in loue.
The~ thus it shal be, Ile tel the king the maid is fair,
Of nut browne cullour, comelie and fair spoken,
Worthie companion to an Earle or so:
But not a Bride for <font>Edgar, Englands</font> King,
This will alay the strong effects in loue.
Fame wrought in <font>Edgars</font> mind of <font>Alfrida</font> .
Well, Ile to court, and dallie with the King,
And worke some means to draw his mynde from loue.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter a Knight, Squire, and Farmer.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Knight</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neighbour <font>Walter</font> I cannot but admire to see
How housekeeping is decayed within
this thirtie yare,
<pagebreak id="D3R" />
But where the fault is God knowes, I knowe not: 
My father in his lyfe time gaue hospitality to all strangers, and
Distressed traueillers, his table was neuer emptie of bread, beefe
And beere, he was woont to keep a hundred tall men in his hall.
He was a feaster of all commers in generall,
And yet was he neuer in want of money:
I thinke God did blesse him with increase, for his bountiful mind
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Farm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly sir, I am sorrie, you ar fallen into decay,
In that you want to maintaine houshould charge,
And whereof comes this want, I will tell you sir,
Tis only throw your great housekeeping:
Be ruled by me, and doe as I aduise you:
You must learne to leaue so great a traine of men,
And keepe no more than needs of force you must,
And those you keepe, let them be simple men,
For they will be content with simple fare,
Keepe but a boy or two within your house,
To run of errants, and to wait on you, 
And for your kitchin, keep a woman cooke,
One that will serue for thirtie shillings a yeare:
And by that means you saue two liueries,
And if ye will keep retainers towards you,
Let them be Farmers, or rich husbandmen,
For you shal find great profit (sir) in keeping them:
For if you stand in need of corne or hay,
Send but to them, and you may haue it strait:
And if you kill a Beefe, let it be so leane
The Butcher nor the Grasyer will not buy it,
Your drinke is too strong, and tastes too much of malt,
Tush, single beere is better far, both for your profit, and your     
seruants health
And at a Christmasse time feast none at al,
But such as yeeld you some commoditie:
I meane such as will send you now and then,
Fat Geese and Capons to keep house withall,
To these and none els would I haue you liberall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knight.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why neighbor, my goods are lent me to no other  
end
<pagebreak id="D3V" />
But to releeue my needie brethren, but God I hope hath in store for  
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, trust you to that, &amp; you may hap die a begger:
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Squ.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why sir, if he should not trust in God, in whom    
should he
trust, for God is the giuer of all good whatsoeuer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, and yet tis good for a man to trust to       
himselfe now
and then: for if you be downe, and bid God help you vp, and do not
help your self, you may fortune lie and perish: and therefore, serue
God on Sundaies, as you are appointed, and thereby hope to be
saued, for by your almes deeds you cannot, for if you giue to the
poore, there be manie wil say, he thinks to bee saued by his almes
deedes: and thus you shal be ill thought on for your good wil, and
therfore learn to prouide for your self, let God prouide for the pore
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tel you neighbor, my great grandfather, &amp; all my
predecessors haue bene held in good regard for their good
housekeeping, and (God willing) their good names shal neuer take an
exigent in me, for I wil (God willing) keepe such hospitalitie to my
death, as my state can maintaine, and I will rather sell my land,
to maintain hous-keeping, then keeping my land make sale of my
good name for housekeeping, but stay, who comes here.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter two poore old men and a Bayliefe.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>One old man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God saue you sir, I pray be good to me for 
cham
a poore man, and I cannot tell what you will doe, for you say my
horse hath broken into your corn, or your corne into my horse,
But indeed my neighbor saw your boy driue my horse into a field
But Ile stand to nothing, nowe I am warnd with a peece of
paper, and a litle ware, to prepare or proceed to London,
And there I am inuented, I cannot tell for what:
The Bailiefe here hath arested me ere I was weary against my
will: he said it was vpon your suit, &amp; yet he laid his hands on me,
Nay more, on my shoulder.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Another old.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And sir, and it may please you, I borrowed 
certen
corn, and I brought you your corne again, and yet you rest me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True sir, but then was corne sold for foure        
shillings a 
bushell, and now tis sold for two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kni.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sir, but he borrowed corne, and promised to pay  
you corn
againe, and you can haue but so much as you lent:
<pagebreak id="D4R" />
For if he should pay you at the rate you demande,
You wold haue for the twentie bushels you lent, fourtie,
Which were neither right nor conscience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O sir, I pray let me alone with my conscience,
You would haue me giue al I haue away to the poore, &amp; want as
you do, I pray let me alone to deale for my selfe: heare you, haue
you rested them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bail.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue sir as you commanded me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then to prison with them, til they haue paid such
dammages as the law shal award them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>One poor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hear you sir, if you shuld bid your boy break 
downe
a gap, and driue in my horse, twere litle better than plaine
knauerie, for my horse is as honest a horse, as any is in this towne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Another.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel neighbor, we wil haue the horse examined
before an officer, and my boy Jack shal write what the horse speaks
and if the horse say a was driuen in against his wil,
Then you may haue the law of him, neighbor,
For all the horses in the parish wil be sworne for his horse.
But Ile stand to nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel, to prison with the~ til they haue paid your   
due, 
away with them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>One poor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I pray, be more miserable to me, and I wil
giue you fourtie shillings when I haue it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By the Mas the knaue hath a pretie cottage,
Ile see and I can get that: sirra, you haue an old cottage,
If you will make me that ouer by deed of gift,
I am content to draw my action.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Another p.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My house? why tis my goods, my wyfe, my land,
My horse my asse, or any thing that is his: no you Caterpiller, 
I will neuer make away my house, I wil die first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Squi.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tel me sir, howe much wold you haue of them for
their trespasse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mary, for fourtie shillings, and yet I befriend    
them,
Why sir, I hope you will not pay it for them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kni.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I wil: sirra Bailie, I will answere the poore  
mens
debts, and <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: aud</comment> come home to me for thy fee anon, go 
old men.
Get you home and praise God.
<pagebreak id="D4V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>One poor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mary Jesus blesse you: naibor, how many such  
good
Knightes haue you now a dayes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Anoth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Too few, neighbor, the more is the pitie.        
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
But come lets away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Knight.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But who comes her?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Perin and Honesty.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God saue you gentlemen, the king greets you, and   
at this time,
Hauing some occasion, to vse mony, hath sent to know
What you that be Knightes and Squires wil lend his Grace,
And you maister Farmer, be brief (sir) for I cannot stay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kni.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, though hous-keeping be some hindrance to my   
willing
mind by reason it robs me of that, which shuld bewray my louing
mind both to my prince &amp; country, money I meane which at this
time I stand in some want of, yet of that smal store that I haue,
am willing to impart the lending of the king xx. pound, and more
I assure you I am not able.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Perin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very wel, and what say you maister Squire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Squire,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say that my reuenewes are but small, yet I will
lend his Maiestie ten pound:
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very wel, but what saith the Farmer?
What can he spare the King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry sir, I am a poore Farmer, &amp; yet I can affoord
To lend the King a hundred or two of pounds,
And heare you sir, if you prefer a suit I haue to the King,
I will giue you fourtie Angels for your paines:
Besides, I will giue you the keeping of a dozen iades:
And now and then meat for you and your horse.
If you come to my house and lie a whole yeare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why thats well said, and I commend thy honest mind,
Would all men wer of thy mind:
I warrant thee, thou art an honest man, &amp; one that loues the king
But tel me, what wouldst thou haue me doe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing but procure me the Kings letter to conuey  
corn
beyond seas, for in England it is so good cheap, that a man can
make no liuing by selling thereof: therfore if the King wil grant
me his letter, I will at any time, lend him fiue or sixe hundred     
pound,
<pagebreak id="E1R" />
and perhaps neuer ask it again, and I wil not forget your paines.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, feare not, I wil do it for you, I warrant you,
For I tel you I can do much with the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beleeue you wil do more than you wil be          
commended for,
The Courtier resembleth the Iay, that decketh her self with the
feathers of other birds, to make her self glorious:
So the Courtier must be braue, tho he be hangd at the gallous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wel sir, wil it please you to come and dine with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thanke you sir hartily.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But whats he there in your company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Perin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A plaine fellow, and his name is <font>Honesty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Far.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O let him go where he will, for he shal not dine   
with me.

Both for the ache of head, and paine of eyes.
I wil, if so it please the Earle to accept it,
Indeuour what I may to comfort him.
My Lord, I haue waters of approoued worth,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think of Kings fauors as of a Marigold flower,
That as long as the Sun shineth openeth her leaues,
<pagebreak id="E2V" />
And with the least cloud closeth againe:
Or lyke the Violets in <font>America</font> , that in sommer yeeld an         
odifferous smell,
And in winter a most infectious sauour:
For at euery ful sea they flourish, or at euery dead ope they vade:
The fish <font>Palerna</font> being perfect white in the calme,
Yet turneth blacke with euery storme:
Or lyke the trees in the deserts of <font>Africa</font> ,
That flourish but while the southwest wind bloweth:
Euen so (my Lord) is the fauours of kings to them they fauour,
For as their fauours giue lyfe, so their frownes yeeld death.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Per.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is my gratious Lord an honest man,
And one it seemes that loues you Maiestie:
For as your Grace gaue me in charge,
I went about into the countrey, to see what summes of money I could

Among the cheefest of the communaltie:
And mongst the richest Knights that I could fynd,
They would lend your Grace at most but twenty pound                  
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: ponnd</comment> ,
And euery Squire would lend you Grace but ten:
Then came I mongst the rest to this plaine man,
And asked him what he would lend the king,
He aunswered sir, you see I am but poore,
Not halfe so wealthy as a Knight or Squire,
And yet in signe of dutie to his Grace,
I wil lende his Maiestie two hundred pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thanks honest fellow, for thy loue to vs,

That in the wane of my decreasing yeares,
Vouchsafes this honour to Earle <font>Osricks</font> house.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Osr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What els my Sonne?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, as you will, but heare you wyfe, what do you

in this, that <font>Edgar</font> means to come and be your guest?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Alfr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke my Lord he shall be welcom then,
And I hope that you will entertaine him so:
That he may know how <font>Osrick</font> honours him:
And I will be attyred in cloth of Bis,
Beset with Orient pearle, fetcht from rich Indian
And all my chamber shall be richly,
With Aras hanging, fetcht from Alexandria,
Then will I haue rich Counterpoints and muske,
Calamon, and Casia, sweet smelling Amber Greece,
That he may say, <font>Venus</font> is come from heauen.
And left the Gods to marie <font>Ethenwald</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Zwouns, they are both agreed to cuckold me,
But heare you wyfe, while I am master of the Bark,
I meane to keepe the helmster in my hand:
My meaning is, you shall be rulde by me,
In being disguised till the King be gone,
And thus it shall be, for I will haue it so.
The King hath neuer seene thee I am sure,
Nor shall he see thee now, if I can chuse:
For thou shalt be attyrde in some base weedes,
And Kate the kitchin maid shall put on thine:
For being richly tyred, as she shall be,
She will serue the turne to keep him companie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Osr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, men that heare of this will make a scorne of

Till I haue seene the Earle of Cornwels wife.

And one whose bringing vp hath bene but rude:

But if your Grace want merrie companie,
I will send for Ladies wise and curteous.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Priest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue bene this morning with a friend of mine,
That would borrow a small summe of money of me,
But I haue learned the best assurance a man can haue,
In such a matter is a good pawn of twise the valew,
Or bonds sufficient for fiue times the quantitie.
He is my neere kinsman, I confesse, and a Clergie man,
But fiftie shillings is money, &amp; though I think I might trust him
simply with it for a tweluemoneth, where hee craues it but for a 
moneth, yet simply I will not be so simple:
For I will borrow his gelding to ride to the Terme,
And keep away a iust fortnight:
If then he pay me my money, I will deliuer him his horse,
I wold be loth to lose my mony, or craue assurance of my kinsma~,
But this may be done to trie me, &amp; I meane lykewise to try him.
This is plain, though trulie (brethren) somthing subtill.
But here comes one would faine take my house of me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neighbor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I am a poore man, and I wil giue you     
thirty
shillings a yere, if I may haue it you shal be sure of your money.

I hope sir, you will pardon mee though I beg, and therefore for
Gods sake one peny, good master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>priest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why I tel thee no, for the Spirit doth not

Salomon, which is, good deeds do not iustify a man, therfore I count
it sinne to giue thee any thing.

And though I speake contrarie to your mind,
Yet doe I build on hope you will pardon me.
Were I as eloquent as <font>Demosthenes</font> ,
Or lyke <font>Isocrates</font> were giuen to Oratorie.
Your Grace no doubt wil think the time well spent,
And I should gaine me commendations:
But for my note is tuned contrary,

Nor will we pull our setled loue from thee,
Vntill we find thy dealings contrarie:
But if thy parlie be for <font>Ethenwald</font> ,
That base dissembler with his soueraigne.
Twere better leaue to speake in his excuse,
Than by excusing him gaine our ill will:
For I am minded like the Salamander stone,
That fir'd with anger, wil not in hast be quencht:
Though wax be soft, &amp; apt to receiue any impression.
Yet will hard mettell take no forme, except you melt the same.
So meane mens minds may moue as they think good,

Your Grace may call to mind proud <font>Marius</font> fall,
That through his wilfull mind, lost lyfe and empire,
And <font>Nimrod</font> , that built huge Babylon,
And thought to make a toure to check the cloudes,
Was soone dismaid by vnknowne languages:
For no one knew what any other spake,
Which made him to confesse, though twere too late,

Did dote so far vpon an Almaine maid,
And was so rauisht with her pleasing sight,
That full seuen yeares he kept her vnder earth,
Euen in the lyfe time of faire <font>Guendolin</font> :

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On me? nay on him: Priest, I gaue your petition    
to the King,
<pagebreak id="G3R" />
And I wil speake to him you may be but hanged,
For if you should liue till the King granted your petition,
The verie Rauens would picke out thine eies liuing:
And therefore twere better you were hanged to saue the birds a labour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now <font>Honesty</font> , hast thou done, is here all?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Honesty.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O no, my Lord, for there are so many behind,
That I am affraide my worke will neuer haue an end:
But I see by the Priests lookes, he lackes company,
Stay a while, my Lord, Ile fetch another presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, Gracelesse man, hast thou no feare of God,
To withold thee from these lawlesse motions,
Why, thou shouldst be as Messenger of God,
And hate deceit and wicked auarice:
But thou art one of those whome God doth hate,
And thy vilde deedes will witnesse gainst thy soule:
And make the most abominable in his sight,
That made thee (wretch) but to a better end,
Then thus to wrong his sacred Deitie.
Now fie vpon thee monster of a man,
That for to gaine thy selfe a priuate gaine,
Wouldst seeke the vndooing of a common wealth.
And though thou bid ten thousand torments here
They cannot quit thee where thou shalt appeare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Honest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Prize, though it be long, I haue found him    
at last,
But I could not bring him with me,
And therefore I pind a paper on his shoulder,
Meaning thereby to marke him for the gallous:
But husht, here he comes.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Perin.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Perin</font> ? I cannot think that <font>Perin</font>    
wil be false to me
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why no, for he is false to himself, look in his    
pocket &amp; see,
This is but a false writ that he hath vsed,
Vnknowne to your Maiestie, and leuied great summes of money,
And bribed vpon your poore Commons extreamlie,
How say you my Lord, is this true or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Honesty</font> , thou sayest true, why, impious      
wretch,
<pagebreak id="G3V" />
Ingratefull wretch that thou art to iniure him that alwaies held     
thee deere,
Beleeue me <font>Dunston</font> , I durst wel haue sworn,
That <font>Perin</font> had not hatcht so base a thought,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, but your Grace sees you are deceiued.
But will your Grace grant me one boone?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whats that <font>Honesty</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I may haue the punishing of them,
Whom I haue so laboured to fynde.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>King.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my hart <font>Honesty</font> , vse them as thou   
wilt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank your Grace: go fetch the other two:
Now to you Cutbert Cutpurse the <font>Conicatcher</font> ,
Thy iudgment is to stand at the Market crosse,
And haue thy cursed tongue pind to thy breast,
And there to stand <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: staud</comment> for men to woonder at:
Til Owles and night-Rauens picke out thy cursed eies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Conicatch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Honestie be more mercifull.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You know my mind: O <font>Walter</font> that wold haue more,
And you shall haue iudgement I meane, which is,
To be caried into a corne field, and ther <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: thtr</comment> haue 
your legs and hands
cut off, because you loued corn so wel, and there rest til the crowes
pick out thine eies.
   But now to you that wil do nothing except the spirit mooue you    
thereunto,
You shall for abusing the blessed word of God,
And mocking the diuine order of Ministery,
Whereby you haue led the ignorant into errours,
You (I say) as you were shamlesse in your shamefull dealing,
Shal to your shame, &amp; the vtter shame of al bad minded men,
That liue as thou hast done,
Stand in Finsburie fields, neere London,
And there (as a dissembling Hypocrit) be shot to death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>priest.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good <font>Honesty</font> , be more fauourable than so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Trulie no, the spirit doth not mooue me therunto,
But who is next, what <font>Perin</font> , a Courtier, and a Cosoner to, 
I haue a iudgment yet in store for thee,
And for because I will vse thee fauourablie,
Yfaith thy iudgment is to be but hanged,
<pagebreak id="G4R" />
But where? euen at Tyborne in a good two-peny halter,
And though you could neuer abide the seas,
Yet now against your wil, you must bear your saile, namely your sheet,
And in a cart be towde vp Holburne hill,
Would all men liuing lyke these in this land,
Might be iudged so at <font>Honesties</font> hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well <font>Honestie</font> come follow vs to Court,
Where <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Wheee</comment> thou shalt be rewarded for thy paine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank your Grace: you that wil damne your selues 
for lucres sake
And make no conscience to deceiue the poore:
You that be enemies of the common wealth:
To send corne ouer to inrich the enemie:
And you that doe abuse the word of God,
And send ouer woolle and Tin, broad cloath and lead,
And you that counterfeyt Kings priuie seales,
And thereby rob the willing minded Communaltie,
I warne you all that vse such subtill villanie,
Beware least you lyke these be found by Honestie,
Take heed I say, for if I catch you once,
Your bodies shall be meat for Crowes,
And the Deuill shall haue your bones,
And thus though long at last we make an end,
Desiring you to pardon whats amisse,
And way the worke, though it be grosly pend,
Laugh at the faults, and weigh it as it is,
And Honestie wil pray vpon his knee,
God cut then off that wrong the Prince or Communaltie 
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Commnnaltie</comment> .
And may her dayes of blesse neuer haue end,
Vpon whose lyfe so many lyues depend. </dialogue> <head> <font> <foreign>FINIS.</foreign> </font> </head>
