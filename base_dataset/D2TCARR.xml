   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">NOTE IN MARGIN GIVES NAME AND      
TITLE AS ELLESMERE, LORD CHANCELLOR.</comment> <font>Robert</font> Earl
of <font>Somerset</font> , you have been arraigned,
and pleaded Not Guilty; now I must tell
you, whatsoever you have to say in your own
Defence, say it boldly, without Fear; and tho it be
not the ordinary Custom, you shall have a Pen and
Ink to help your Memory: but remember that
God is the God of Truth; a Fault defended is a
double Crime; hide not the Verity, nor affirm
an Untruth; for, to deny that which is true,
increases the Offence; take heed lest your Wilfulness
cause the Gates of Mercy to be shut upon you.
Now for you, my Lords the Peers, you are to
give diligent Attention to that which shall be
said; and you must not rest alone upon one piece
of Evidence, but ground your Judgment upon the
whole. This moreover I would have you
remember, that tho you be not sworn as common Juries,
upon a Book, yet that you are ty'd in as great a
Bond, your own Honour and Fidelity, and
Allegiance to the King: and thus I leave the whole
Proceeding to your Censures. And for you that
be of the King's Counsel, free your Discourse from
all Partiality, but let Truth prevail, and endeavour
to make it appear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj. Montague.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord High Steward of
<font>England</font> , and you my Lords, this cannot but be a heavy
Spectacle unto you, to see that Man that not long
since in great Place, with a white Staff, went
before the King, now at this Bar hold up his
Hand for Blood; but this is the Change of 
<pagebreak id="335C1" />
Fortune, nay, I might better say, the Hand of God,
and Work of Justice, which is the King's Honour.
   But now to the Fact; Robert Earl of <font>Somerset</font>
stands indicted as Accessary before the Fact, of the
wilful Murder and Poisoning of Sir <font>Thomas
Overbury</font> , done by <font>Weston</font> , but procur'd by him;
this, my Lord, is your Charge. The Indictment
hath been found by Men of good Quality,
seventeen Knights and Esquires of the best Rank and
Reputation, some of whose Names I will be bold
to read unto you; Sir <font>Thomas Fowler</font> , Sir <font>William 
Slingsby</font> , and fifteen more; these have return'd <font> <foreign>billa
vera</foreign> </font> . Now an Indictment is but an Accusation of
Record in Form thus: <font>Weston</font> , at four several
times, gave <font>Overbury</font> four several Poisons, the first,
<font>May</font> the 9th, 1613. that was <font>Rosalgar</font> , carrying
this Poison in one Hand, and his Broth in the
other; the second was <font>June</font> following, and that
was <font>Arsenick</font> ; the third was <font>July</font> the 10th
following, and that was <font>Mercury Sublimate</font> in Tarts; the
fourth was <font>September</font> the 14th following, and that was
<font>Mercury Sublimate</font> in a Clyster, given by
<font>Weston</font> and an Apothecary yet unknown, and that
kill'd him. Of these four several Poisons ministred
by <font>Weston</font> , and procured by you, the 15th of
<font>September</font> 1615. <font>Overbury</font> dy'd, and the Author is ever
worse than the Actor. The first Poison laid in the
Indictment, that <font>Weston</font> gave Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> ,
was the 9th of <font>May</font> ; and therefore we say, That
the Lord <font>Somerset</font> , the 8th of <font>May</font> , hir'd, counsell'd
and abetted <font>Weston</font> to this Fact: and as this Day,
my Lord, I do you charge you for a King, so
heretofore King <font>David</font> was charg'd in the like Case, for
the Murder of <font>Uriah</font> ; and tho <font>David</font> was under
his Pavilion, and <font>Uriah</font> in the Army, yet <font>David</font>
was the Cause of his Murder: So tho you were
in the King's Chamber, and <font>Overbury</font> in the
Tower, yet it was you that kill'd him. It was a stronger
Hand than <font>Weston's</font> that wrought this. The Proof,
Mr. Attorney will follow; and I will now
conclude with two Desires to the Peers: First, That
they will not expect visible Proofs in the Work of
Darkness: The Second is, That whereas in an
Indictment there be many things laid only for Form,
you are not to look that the Proof should follow
that, but only that which is substantial; and the
Substance must be this, Whether my Lord of
<font>Somerset</font> procur'd or caus'd the Poisoning of Sir
<font>Thomas Overbury</font> , or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That indeed, my Lords, is that
which you are to look after, Whether my Lord of
<font>Somerset</font> was the Cause of his Poisoning, or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was very well mov'd by Mr.
Recorder, and the Law is clear in this Point, that the
Proof must follow the Substance, not the Form.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Judges all rising, affirm'd this to be true.</nonSpeech>

<pagebreak id="345C2" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Next follows the Proof for
surprizing Letters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Davis exam.</font> Saith; That in Summer last my
Lord sent <font>Rawlins</font> to him, to desire that if he had
any Letters, either from my Lord to Sir <font>Thomas</font> ,
or from him to my Lord, that he would send them
by him; which he did: And for this my Lord
did afterwards send him by <font>Rawlins</font> 30 <font>l.</font> </nonSpeech>

 <head>GEORGE ERRAT <font>THE CONSTABLE'S EXAMINATION</font> .</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Saith, That <font>Poulter</font> , a Messenger, brought him
a Warrant from my Lord of <font>Somerset</font> , to break open 
and search a House for certain Writings, which
were pretended to be one Mrs. <font>Hide's</font> ,  a Sister of
Mrs. <font>Turner's</font> ; and that he shew'd him a part of
the Warrant only, but not all; so that for that
cause he would not execute it. Whereupon, 
<font>Poulter</font> , got Smiths himself to break open the House and
Doors, and found in the Cellar a Box and Bag of
Writings, where he saw the Name of Mrs. <font>Turner</font> ;
and those were carried to my Lord.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For these Letters, Sir <font>Robert Cotton</font>
deliver'd them me back after my Lord of <font>Northampton's</font>
Death; and concerning the Dates, you need not
trouble yourself, for it now grows late, and I shall have
very little time to answer for my self. I confess Sir
<font>Robert Cotton</font> deliver'd me back those Letters I had
sent my Lord of <font>Northampton</font> , and that I burnt them;
and that some Parts were cut off as impertinent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir R. Cotton exam.</font> Saith, my Lord deliver'd
into his hands many of Sir <font>Thomas Overbury's</font>
Letters; and that he cut and dated them by my Lord's
Direction; and that he put in Dates the next Day
to some of the Letters, after <font>Weston's</font>
Arraignment.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire my Lord will be pleas'd
to look upon this Book of <font>Overbury's</font> Letters. And
now for the Copy of the largest Pardon;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Robert Cotton</font> saith, That at my Lord of
<font>Somerset's</font> Intreaty, a little before <font>Michalemas</font> last, he
got him a Draught of the largest Pardon, and the
Precedent was of one that King <font>Henry</font> the Eighth
granted to Cardinal <font>Wolsey</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> and if he desired such
a one, I told him the best way was to follow
Precedents.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Pardon was read; wherein, amongst other
Offences, before and after, of small account,
Treason and Murder be foisted in.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And this was it that made <font>Weston</font>
fear that the Net was for the little Fishes, and that
the great ones could break through.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Alderman Bowles exam.</font> Saith, That after he had
persuaded <font>Weston</font> from standing mute, he told him
That he fear'd the Net was laid for the little Fishes,
and that the great ones would break through.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The last thing I urge, is my
Lord's Declaration to the King, which I desire
should be read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The same that were noted before, after he
understood by my Lord <font>Coke</font> that he was to be
arraign'd <font>&amp;c.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You see, my Lords, in this
Declaration of my Lord of <font>Somerset</font> there is a Brink of
Confession; I would to God it had a Bottom. He
urges that in respect he hath formerly been so great
in the King's Favour, and had never committed
any Treason, neither against his Person nor State,
that he should never have been call'd to an Account
for this Fault, though he had been guilty: That
Grace timely given is a Benefit; and that it is not
<pagebreak id="346C1" />
only enough to give Life, but to save Reputation.
But if he must be urg'd, then he desires his Wife might
be pardon'd, having confess'd the Fact: And that if
he must be put upon the Hazard of a Trial, the
King will before give him leave to dispose of his
Lands and Goods to the Use of his Wife and
Child; and that in the mean time he will give my
Lord <font>Hay</font> and Sir <font>Robert Carr</font> leave to come to
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Declaration is an
implicative Confession.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think there is none here but
wonders, seeing that all Poisons be Works of
Darkness, how this should so clearly appear: But it
seems, his Greatness in Fortune caus'd this
Grossness in offending.
<comment type="compiler">SOMERSET'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED. HE CLAIMS THE ONLY POISON HE SENT 
WAS THAT WHICH OVERBURY REQUESTED, AND THAT HE DID NOT SEND HIM 
POISONED TARTS.</comment>
<pagebreak id="346C2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Lisle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had sent him good Tarts, you
should have seen them convey'd by a trusty
Messenger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Compton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lady, in her Letter to the
Lieutenant, writes, I was bid to bid you do this.
Who should bid her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serjeant Montague.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The continual Letters
between my Lord and her argues that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If <font>Franklin</font> knew me so well, and that
I was privy to the Plot, why should then my Wife
and I (as he pretends) when he was there, speak so
closely, and always out of his Hearing and Sight?
But for <font>Overbury</font> , my furthest Intent in his
Imprisonment was, that he should be no Impediment to my
Marriage; and this I communicated to my Lord
of <font>Northampton</font> and <font>Elvis</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj. Montague.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You could not couple your self
worse than with them two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereas <font>Simcocks</font> says, from the
Relation of <font>Weston</font> , That he so often came to me; I
protest I never saw him till after <font>Overbury's</font> Death,
and then <font>Rawlins</font> brought him to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Jervis Elvis</font> in his Examination
saith, That <font>Weston</font> many times told him, that my
Lord of <font>Somerset</font> many times sent for him: And
for this purpose you shall have <font>Weston's</font>
Examination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weston's Examin.</font> Saith, That my Lord of
<font>Somerset</font> many times sent him Directions, before
<font>Overbury's</font> going to the Tower, to appoint Meetings
betwixt him and my Lady.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This may hold, and yet that I never
spake to him: So for those Messages he spoke of,
he might receive Directions from me by a third
Person. And for that which <font>Payton</font> alledges about
the Powder which I sent, and made Sir <font>Thomas
Overbury</font> so sick; that Powder I sent was one of
them which I receiv'd from Sir <font>Robert Killegrew</font> .
<pagebreak id="347C1" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj. Crew.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But this, my Lord, was none of the
Powders you receiv'd from Sir <font>Robert Killegrew</font> ,
for you had three from him: The first was lost;
the second you sent him by <font>Rawlins</font> ; and the third
your self took at <font>Buly</font> : Now a fourth, which was
sent by <font>Davis</font> , was that that made him so sick, and
gave him so many Stools; and that was Poison, and
sent three Weeks after that that <font>Rawlins</font> carried.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Robert Killegrew</font> saith, That my Lord
desir'd him to give him Powders, which he himself
sometimes us'd to take for a Vomit; but he
thought it had been only for himself, not that he
had had a Purpose to send it to Sir <font>Thomas
Overbury</font> ; and that my Lord never had of this Powder
of him but thrice.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Rawlins exam.</font> Saith, That the first Vomit
Sir <font>Robert Killegrew</font> gave my Lord, was laid upon
a Tester of a Bed, and lost; and that then upon
that he got another, which my Lord sent to Sir
<font>Thomas Overbury</font> by him; and afterwards a third,
which my Lord took at <font>Buly</font> : But he never heard
that Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> desir'd my Lord to send
him any.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Franklin exam.</font> Saith, That he provided a white
Powder, which was Poison, for my Lady called it
<font>Arsenick</font> ; which, as my Lady did afterwards tell
him, was sent to Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> in a Letter.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not think you can take <font>Franklin</font>
for a good Witness. Now for the Antedates which
are us'd as a Circumstance against me; Sir <font>Robert
Cotton</font> mov'd me to it, saying, That the Dates
might prove useful to me at this time. Whereas
my Lord of <font>Northampton</font> writes in one of his
Letters, That he had promoted the Lieutenant; I
conceive his Meaning to be, That he should
endeavour to make <font>Overbury</font> to be a good Instrument
betwixt my Lord of <font>Suffolk</font> and me; and to that end,
those whom he thought to be his principal Enemies
should be the only Causers of his Freedom. And
what I understand by <font>Elvis's</font> Conclusion, which my
Lord of <font>Northampton</font> relates in the end of one of
his Letters to me, That Death is the best Way;
I wish that my Answers to those Letters were now
to be seen: and if I had ever thought that those
Letters of my Lord of <font>Northampton's</font> would be
dangerous to me, it is likely I would never have
kept them. For the Warrant I made, my Wife
desir'd me to do it for Mrs. <font>Turner's</font> sake: <font>Packer</font>
formed it; and told me, I might do it as a
Counsellor alone, without other Hands; for I would
have had at that time my Lord <font>Knowles</font> to have
joined with me, but that he was at Council. And
when this Warrant was sent, I was not commanded
from Court, as is pretended.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. High-Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All the Council together could
not justify the making of such a Warrant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my endeavouring to get a
Pardon; having had many things of Trust under the
King, and the Custody of both the Seals, without
particular Warrant, I desir'd by this means to be
exonerated. And for all general Words, the
Lawyers put them in without my Privity. And for the
Precedent of the largest Pardon, which I had from
Sir <font>Robert Cotton</font> , it was upon this occasion: Sir
<font>Robert Cotton</font> said, In respect you have receiv'd
some Disgrace in the Opinion of the World, in
having past that Pardon which the last Summer
you desir'd, especially seeing there be many
Precedents of larger; I would have you now get one
after the largest Precedent, that so by that
Addition you might recover your Honour. And upon
this I bad him search for the largest.
<pagebreak id="347C2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Serj. Mount.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Robert Cotton</font> says otherwise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir R. Cotton exam.</font> Saith, My Lord desir'd to
seek Precedents of the largest Pardons.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the Declaration which I lately
sent to the King, and particularly the Word
<font> (Mercy) </font> , which is now so much urg'd against me, it was
the Lieutenant's; for I would have us'd another,
but he said it could be nothing prejudicial unto
me: But when I writ it, I did not think thus to
be sifted in this Declaration; for I in that, in all
Humility, did so far endeavour to humble and yield
my self, that the King might the better express his
Grace. And for the Words, (That I did consent
to and endeavour the Imprisonment of Sir <font>Thomas
Overbury</font> ) it is true, for the Reason there
alledg'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please your Grace, my
Lord here hath had a most gracious Hearing, and
hath behav'd himself modestly and wittily.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. High-Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you have any more to say,
my Lord, you shall be heard at length; we will
not straiten you in Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For <font>Loubell</font> , I never saw him but
twice: He affirms the contrary, I deny it; and
there is none else that proves it but himself. For
Sir <font>Robert Cotton</font> , I could wish that he were here to
clear many things that now be obscure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he were here, he could not be
sworn, for Reason of State, being held for a
Delinquent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For Sir <font>David Wood</font> , there was a
Suit wherein he might have benefited himself
1200 <font>l.</font> which I was willing to further him in,
conditionally, that <font>Overbury</font> should have been a
Sharer: But for the not effecting of it, it seems, he
took some dislike of Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> . The
Money that is said Sir <font>Jervis Elvis</font> gave for his
Place, I had no part of it. Whereas the shifting
of Offices is urg'd against me, to make the more
easy Way for <font>Elvis's</font> Entrance; it is well known,
the reason of <font>Wade's</font> displacing was in respect of
his Carelesness, in suffering the Lady <font>Arabella</font> to
have a Key, by which she might have convey'd her
self out of Prison. More I cannot call to mind;
but desire Favour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It hath, my Lord, formerly at
Arraignments been a Custom, after the King's
Counsel and the Prisoner's Defence hath been heard,
briefly to sum up what hath been said; But in this
we have been so formal in the Distribution, that
I do not think it necessary: And therefore now
there is no more to be done, but that the Peers
will be pleas'd to confer, and the Prisoner to
withdraw till the Censures be past.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, before you go together,
I beseech you give me leave to recommend my self
and Cause unto you: As the King hath raised me
to your Degree, so he hath now dispos'd me to
your Censures. This may be any of your own
Cases, and therefore I assure my self you will not
take Circumstances for Evidence; for if you should,
the Condition of a Man's Life were nothing. In
the mean time, you may see the Excellence of the
King's Justice; which makes no Distinction,
putting me into your hands for a just and equal
Censure. For my part, I protest before God I was
neither guilty of, nor privy to, any Wrong that
<font>Overbury</font> suffer'd in this kind. A Man sensible of
his own Preservation, had need to express himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>So he being withdrawn from the Bar, my Lord
High-Steward briefly reported to the Lords the
Proofs against my Lord of <font>Somerset</font> . Then the
<pagebreak id="348C1" />
Lords by themselves (and my Lord Steward for his
Ease, but returning before the rest) staid some time
together, in which Interim they sent for the two
Chief Justices. Being return'd, the Serjeant-Cryer
Mr. <font>Fenshaw</font> , called every Lord by his Name,
<font>Robert</font> Lord <font>Dormer</font> , and so to the rest, before my
Lord High-Steward spake.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. High-Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Robert</font> Lord <font>Dormer</font> , How
say you? Whether is <font>Robert</font> Earl of <font>Somerset</font>
guilty of the Felony, as Accessary before the Fact, of
the wilful Poisoning and Murder of Sir <font>Thomas
Overbury</font> , whereof he hath been indicted and
arraigned, or not guilty? </dialogue><nonSpeech>And so particularly to
every Lord, one by one.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Dormer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Guilty, my Lord: </dialogue><nonSpeech>Standing up, and
bare-headed; then sitting again. My Lord 
<font>Norris</font> , when it came to him, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Guilty of
Murder: </dialogue><nonSpeech>But being told by my Lord High-Steward
that he must say either Guilty, or Not guilty, to
the Indictment, he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Guilty. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr.
Lieutenant brought the Prisoner again to the Bar: But
he had before taken off his George himself.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord High-Steward, <font>Robert</font>
Earl of <font>Somerset</font> hath been indicted and arraigned,
and put himself upon his Peers, who all, without
the Difference of one Voice, have found him
guilty; I pray Judgment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Fenshaw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Robert</font> Earl of <font>Somerset</font> , hold up
thy Hand. Whereas thou hast been indicted,
arraign'd, and pleaded Not guilty, as Accessary 
before the Fact, to the wilful Poisoning and Murder
of Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> , and hast put thy self upon
thy Peers, who have found thee guilty; what hast
thou to say for thy self, why Sentence of Death
should not be pronounc'd against thee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sentence that is past upon me
must be just: I only desire a Death according to
my Degree. For that <font>Simcocks</font> said --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. High-Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, you are not now to
speak any more in your Defence; but why
Judgment of Death should not be pronounced.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I have no more to say; but
humbly beseech you my Lord High-Steward, and
the rest of the Lords, to be Intercessors to the King
for his Mercy towards me, if it be necessary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>My Lord High-Steward, taking the
White-Staff from Sir <font>Richard Coningsby</font> , pronounc'd
Sentence.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. High-Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Robert</font> Earl of <font>Somerset</font> ,
Whereas thou hast been indicted, arraign'd, and
found guilty, as Accessary before the Fact, of the
wilful Poisoning and Murder of Sir <font>Thomas
Overbury</font> ; you are therefore to be carried from hence
to the Tower, and from thence to the Place of
Execution, where you are to be hang'd till you be
dead: And the Lord have Mercy upon you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords the Peers, I beseech you,
as you have been the Judges of this Day, so you
will be my Intercessors.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then my Lord Steward broke his Staff, the 
Court dissolv'd, and the Prisoner was carried away.</nonSpeech>
