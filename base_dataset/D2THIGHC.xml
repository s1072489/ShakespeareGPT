 <head>IN THE COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION, 3 MAIJ, 1632.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This day were brought to the Court out of prison divers persons
(and some of them appeared by bond) which were taken on Sunday
last at a Conventicle mett at the house of       Barnett, a brewer's
<pagebreak id="279" />
clarke, dwellinge in the precinct of Black Fryars: by name, John
Latroppe their minister, Humphrey Bernard, Henry Dod, Samuell
Eaton <emendation>William</emendation> Granger, Sara Jones, Sara Jacob, Pennina Howse,
Sara Barbon, Susan Wilson; and divers other there were which
appeared not this day. M=r= Latropp the Minister did not appeare at
the first, but kept himself out of the way a while, therefore the man
of the howse wherein they were taken was first called: who was
asked when he was at his parish church? He answered that he
was then at his parish church when they were in his house, and
that he useth to goe to church, but his wife will not. Then said
THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Will you suffer that in your wife?&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said THE KING'S ADVOCATE</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;These persons were assembled
on Sunday last at this man's house in Black Fryars and there
unlawfullie held a Conventicle, for which there are Articles         
exhibited
in this Court against them; I pray that they may be put to answere
uppon their oathes to the Articles, and that they sett forth what
exercises they used, and what were the words spoken by them.&quot;
&quot;And as for you, M=r= Dod, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (quoth THE ADVOCATE) </nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;you might
well have forborne, seing you have been warned heeretofore, and
passed by upon promise of amendment.&quot; &quot;Good M=r= Advocate,
spare that,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith DOD. He was asked whether he useth to come
to his parish church. He saith he hath come to his parish church
as often as he could and useth to come thither, but he endeavoureth
to heare the most powerfull ministry.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;And therefore,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith THE
BISHOP OF LONDON,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;you heare M=r= Latroppe. What ordination
hath he?&quot; &quot;He is a minister,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith M=r= DOD.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Did you not heare
him preach and pray?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith the BISHOP.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Nay you yourself and
the rest take upon you to preach and to be Ministers.&quot; &quot;Noe,&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>saith M=r= DOD. LONDON,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Yes, you doe, and you were heard
preach and pray.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>DOD,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I shalbe readie in this particular to
confesse my fault, if I am convinced to be in any.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then two of them
were put to their oath, but they desired to be excused for this tyme,
and that they might have some time to consider and be informed of
the oath.
<pagebreak id="280" />
   Then said THE ARCH-BISHOP OF CANTERBURY,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;You shew
yourselves most unthankfull to God, to the King and to the Church
of England, that when (God be praysed) through his Ma=ties= care
and ours you have preaching in every church, and men have liberty
to joyne in prayer and participation of the Sacraments and have
catechizings and all to enlighten you, and which may serve you in
the way of salvation; you in an unthankfull manner cast off all this
yoake, and in private unlawfullie assemble yourselves togeather,
making rents and divisions in the Church. If anie thing be amisse,
let it be knowen, if any thing be not agreeable to the word of God,
we shalbe as readie to redresse it as you, but whereas it is nothing
but your owne imaginations, and you are unlearned men that seeke
to make up a religion of your owne heads! I doubt noe persuasion
will serve the turne. We must take this course: you are called
heere: let them stand upon their bonds, and let us see what they
will answere, it may be they will answere what may please us.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;It is tyme to take notice of these, nay this is not the
4th parte of them about this cittie, you see these came of sett
purpose they mett not by chance, they are desperatlie hereticall:    
they
are all of different places, out of Essex, S=t= Austin's, S=t=       
Martin's Le
Grand, Buttolphs, Algate, Thisleworth, S=t= Saviours: let these be
imprisoned. Let me make a motion; There be fower of the ablest
men of them, let these 4 answere and be proceeded against, and the
while if the rest come in, they shalbe received, but if they will    
not,
I know noe reason why 4 or 5 men should not answere for all.

devoutlie? </dialogue><nonSpeech>LATROPPE,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I keepe noe such evill companie, they

 <head>IN THE COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION AT THE CONSISTORY IN PAULES, 8     
MAY, 1632.</head> 
   <nonSpeech>This day all those that were taken in the Black Fryars were
brought by the Court under the custodie of the Keeper of the New
prison. The King's Advocate shewed that they were taken at a
private Conventicle and prayed that they may take their oathes to
answere the articles which are putt in against them.
   First. Sara Jones was asked, of what parish she was? She
said she dwelleth at Lambeth. LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Doe you come to
the church?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>S. JONES.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;None accuseth me to the contrary.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Where were you upon Sunday was sennight?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>S.
JONES.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;When I have done evill and my accuser come, I will
answere.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>KING'S ADVOCATE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I doe accuse you, take your oath
and you shall knowe your accusacion.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>S. JONES.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I am afraid
to take God's name in vaine, I knowe noe other worship then God
hath appointed.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;This you are commaunded to doe of
God who saieth you must obey your Superiors.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>S. JONES.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;That
which is of God is according to God's word, and the Lord will not
hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine.&quot;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>S. Jacob was called to the booke, but she refused alsoe. Then
was called Marke Lucar: who was asked of what parish he was and
when he was at church? M. LUCAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I am yet to chuse of what
parish to be; and I doe not remember the day of the moneth when
I was at church.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;He doth not remember, I dare say, 
the day of the moneth nor the moneth of the yeare when he was at
<pagebreak id="293" />
church, but he dwelleth in St. Austin's parish. Offer him the booke.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>M. LUCAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;If I may knowe a law and ground for takeing this
oath, I will take it, but I desire to know my articles before I take
my oath.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARCHBISHOP OF YORKE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Whether doe you know or
noe that the King hath power to take an account of your 
proceedings?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Att their perrills. Aske the next.&quot;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>John Ireland was asked where and when he was at church. He
saith at Mary Maudlins Church in Surrey. And that he was at
morninge church within this halfe yeare; but being asked the booke,
refused to sweare. Then were called 4 others, Toby Talbot; William
Pickering; Mabell Milbourne; William Attwood; and were put to
their oathes . And first TALBOT saieth in his excuse, that he knoweth
not the articles what they are; and before he would take this oath
he would know his accuser. S=r= HENRY MARTIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;The law is,
that those that are taken in these Conventicles and remaine          
obstinate,
that they shallbe made to abjure the kingdome, and if they returne,
or obey not, it is felony: therefore, freinds, take heed to          
yourselves,
and know that you have more favour then yee deserve.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>PICKERING.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I trust I have done nothing against the law, and for 
this
oath, I doe not know what belongs to it;&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and he refuseth to take
it. ATTWOOD saith,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he doth not know what the booke is. </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.
MILBOURNE being asked whether she would take her oath, she said
that she would not.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>LONDON spake to Dod, Latroppe, and the man of the house.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;Henry Dod, you are the obstinate and perverse ringleaders of these
folkes: you had a faire admonition the last Court day: and you
have this day assigned you to answere upon your oath.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>DOD.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I
hope we are not soe impious: we stand for the truth: for takeing
the oath I crave your patience, I am not resolved upon it.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>BREWER'S CLARKE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I was at the church, but for takeing the
oath I desire to be resolved.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Mr. Latroppe, hath the
Lord qualified you? What authority; what orders have you? the
<pagebreak id="294" />
Lord hath qualifyed you; Is that a sufficient answere? You must
give a better answere before you and I part.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>LATROPP.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I doe not
know that I have done any thing which might cause me justly to
be brought before the judgement seat of man: and for this oath I
doe not know the nature of it.&quot;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KING'S ADVOCATE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;The manner of the oath is that you shall
answere to that you are accused of, for schisme.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>YORK and
LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;If he will not take his oath, away with him.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>LATROPP.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I desire that other passage may be remembred; I dare
not take this oath.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Wherefore the Court ordered that they
should be kept in straight custodie, especiallie Latropp, for the
BISHOP OF LONDON said he had more to answere then he knew of.
   SAMUELL EATON being demaunded whether he would take the
oath: he answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I doe not refuse it, though I doe not take it:
it is not out of obstinacie, but, as I shall answere it at the Last  
day,
I am not satisfyed whether I may take it.&quot;
   &quot;Samuell Howe!&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith the KING'S ADVOCATE,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;you are
required by your oath to answere to the articles.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>HOWE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I
have served the King both by sea and by land, and I had been at
sea if this restraint had not been made upon me. My conversacion,
I thank God, none can tax.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>REGISTER.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Will you take your
oath?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>HOW.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I am a yong man and doe not know what this
oath is.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>KING'S ADVOCATE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;The King desires your service
in obeying his lawes.&quot;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then P. Howes was called, and required to take her oath, but
she refused. LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Will you trust M=r= Latropp, and beleive
him rather then the Church of England?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>PENNINA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I
referre my self to the word of God, whether I maie take this oath or
noe.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then were called Joane Ferne and Elizabeth Denne: who
refused to sweare till they were informed, and one of them said she
could not read a letter in the booke. The KING'S ADVOCATE
saith their oath was that they should answere trulie as farre as they
knew to the Articles. ELIZABETH SARGEANT saith she must not
sweare but when she is before a Magistrate.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Why now,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith
<pagebreak id="295" />
the BISHOP OF LONDON,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;you are called before the Magistrate,
are you not? John Egge! Will you take your oath?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>He refuseth:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;Henry Packer! Will you take your oath to answear the articles?&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>H. P<emendation>ACKER</emendation> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I doe not deny the oath, though I dare not take
it, till I shall know what I shall sweare.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>JOHN WOODWYNE, He
being tendered the booke, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I desire to know what I shall
sweare to, and what is the end of his oath,&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>before he will sweare.
JOHN MELBORNE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I am not well perswaded of this oath, yet I
will not deny it.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>ELIZABETH MELBORNE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I doe not know any
such thing as a Conventicle, we did meete to pray and talke of the
word of God, which is according to the law of the land.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>YORK.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;God wilbe served publiquely, not in your private house.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>THOMAS
ARUNDELL of S=t= Olave's parish refuseth to take the oath for the
present, till he knew the Articles, that he might informe himself.
William Granger of S=t= Margarett's in Westminster. He being
called, THE BISHOP OF LONDON spake unto him saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Granger!
You look like a man of fashion: will you take your oath to answere
to the articles according to your knowledg, and as farre as you are
bound by law?&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRANGER.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I desire to have some tyme to
consider of it.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;I would not have any of the standers by
thinke that you or any of these have not had tyme to consider of
this, you rent and teare the Church and will not submitt yourself to
the tryal of law. You must know the justice of this Court is
lymited, and you may be driven to abjure the Realme for your
offence.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Robert Reignolds of Thistleworth was tendered the
oath. He desired to speak 2 or 3 wordes:</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;If I have done any
thing against the law, lett me be accused by the course of the law:
if I thought this oath might be taken with a good conscience, I
would take it; and I doe for the present desire you, though you doe
not pitty me, yet to pitty my poore wife and smale children.&quot;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>YORK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Pitty your wife and children yourself, and lay your
obstinacy to your conscience.&quot;

<pagebreak id="297" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>William Sounde, Nicholas Gerard, John Pococke, Daniell
Halmworth, and two others of S=t= Austins parish, near Paule's gate,
appeared upon letters, and tooke their oathes to answere the articles
that were in the Court against them, about their seates in the
Church above the Communion table. THE BISHOP OF LONDON
said he had been scorned and slighted by these men in an irreligious
manner. He saieth he will not take that upon him which he will
not let be knowne heere;</nonSpeech><dialogue> you have made your seates round about
the Communion table; you must not prepare your seates above
God; I desired fairely you would take away the seates; you
answere, &quot;We durst not doe it; we have noe such custome.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>The
parishioners answered that these seates were made there upon an
ould foundation, and that they were built for necessity, their church
being to litle for the parishioners; and if they have not roome,
they must goe to other Churches. LONDON.</nonSpeech><dialogue> As good as you stand,
and have stood. Why, there are noe seates in any church of any
kingdome but this; and what then is your tyme out of minde?
For tyme was when there were noe seates in any Church among
us.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Abigail Delamar, a Frenchman's wife, was brought from the
New prison to the Court, and required to take the oath. She
demanded whether it were the oath of Allegeance; the King's
Advocate said it was to answere the truth to the articles in Court
against her as farre as she knew and was bound by law. She said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;I neither dare nor will take this oath till I am informed of it,

prison, that they might be delivered out of prison. I gave order
that all that came to them that day should be stayed. This woman
came, and because she had a great belly she was carried to a
Taverne, and her husband was sent for, and findinge her in a 
Taverne, and yet tould that she was in prison, he thought it not in

repent, and sometymes we had mercy upon him; after his deprivacion
we were troubled what to doe with him; for if he did not preach,

would try him, and he was admitted to reade homilies. Wise John
Eaton fell to expoundinge of the homilies, and then broached all
