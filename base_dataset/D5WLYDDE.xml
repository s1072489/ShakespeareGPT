 <head>AN
ACCOUNT OF THE TRYAL OF <font>RICHARD LYDDEL</font> , 
ESQ; <font>&amp;C.</font> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>The Jury being sworn to try the Issue between the Right         
Honourable
the Lord <font>Abergavenny</font> , Plaintiff, and <font>Richard Lyddel</font> , Esq;  
Defendant,
upon an Action of Trespass; for that he the said                     
<font>Richard Lyddel</font> , did carry
on a criminal Correspondence with the Plaintiff's Lady, by which Means
he did debauch, carnally know, and committed Adultery with her, to the
great Loss, Disappointment, and Uneasiness of the Plaintiff.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Council for the Plaintiff, after having learnedly opened    
the Circumstances of the
Offence, and peculiar Aggravations attending it, with Regard to the  
Defendant, proceeded to call
in the Witnesses, who deposed as followeth.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The First Evidence that was called to prove the Charge against  
the Defendant was
<font>Elizabeth Hopping</font> : She depos'd, That she lived in his           
Lordship's Family for six Years, and
about three Weeks before <font>Christmas</font> was Twelve-month, the Family  
being at <font>Sheffield</font> House,
his Lordship's Country Seat, took Notice of Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font>         
frequently kissing her Lady in the
Dressing Room, thought the Familiarity was too great betwixt them,   
and unbefitting, gave
Occasion to her to watch their Conversation; that she had seen her   
Lady's Bed tumbled after
it had been made, when none but Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> and her Lady had been 
in the Room: That
another Time knowing them to have been in the Dining Room, below     
Stairs, about nine in
the Morning, was willing to see what they were doing, and placing    
herself in the
With-drawing-Room, she look'd through the Key-hole into the Parlour, 
and opposite to the Place
where she stood, she saw her Lady against the Door that went into    
the Hall, and Mr.
<font>Lyddel</font> against her, that she saw her Lady's Petticoats up as     
high as her Gartering-Place, and that
he had unbuttoned his Coat, but could not see his Breeches down,     
because his Coat behind
covered them; that she saw him do something that a Man ought not to  
do: Being
ask'd, What she thought he was doing; Reply'd, She thought he had a  
criminal
Conversation with her Lady, and being surpriz'd, she look'd a second 
Time, when she then saw
them in the same Posture: And that then, as soon as she could get    
out, she went and
acquainted one of her Fellow Servants, which was the Laundery Maid,  
that she had seen her
Lady with Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> against her, with her Petticoats up, and    
told her, she thought he
was debauching her Lady. Being ask'd whether she thought they were   
in criminal
Conversation together both the Times? She said, she believed they    
were; that they were standing
against the Door, which kept it shut, for it opened into the Room,   
and was not fastened.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="4" />
<nonSpeech>Being ask'd, What was the Ground of her Suspicion? She reply'd,    
she saw him often kiss
her in her Bed-Chamber, Dining-Room, and Dressing-Room. Being ask'd, 
How Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> was received by his Lordship when he came there?  
She replied, His Lordship always
received him very joyfully; that Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> came very often, and 
staid there sometimes a
Week together, and that it was frequent he staid there so long, that 
he lived from his
Lordship's House about seven Miles. She being ask'd, Why she did not 
acquaint her Lord with
it? Reply'd, she thought her Lord would not believe it, but that she 
told her
Fellow-Servant, <font>Elizabeth Letchmere</font> , and that she told no other 
Servant of it. Being ask'd, How
it came to pass when she saw so notorious a Fact, that she did not   
discover it presently to
her Lord? Replied, that no Person dare open such a Thing to his      
Lordship, that it was 
discovered by her, but not 'till her Lord asked her about it. Being  
asked, Whether there was
any Key in the Key-hole of the Lock that she peeped through, or any  
other Covering to it
within side? Replied, there was not, neither was there any Thing to  
hinder her from
looking. Being ask'd, Whether the Door she look'd through was        
lock'd? Replied, that she
knew nothing of that, but the Key was out, for they had been         
cleaning the Locks.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The next was <font>Elizabeth Letchmere</font> , who depos'd, That her    
Fellow-Servant came to her,
and told her, three Weeks before <font>Christmas</font> was Twelve-Month,     
that her Mistress was a
Devil; that she asked her the Reason, she then told her she looked   
through the Key-hole and
saw her against the Door in the Parlour with her Petticoats up, and  
Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> before her,
that this was about nine in the Morning. Being asked, Whether she    
discovered it to any
Body? Replied, she told only Mr. <font>Osbourn</font> of it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>-- <font>Pinches</font> deposed, That the Observation she made, was when 
Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> came to
her Lady, about a Twelve-Month ago; her Lady gave her Orders to go   
out of the Room
when Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> came; that the Bed was unmade when he came, and  
when she went up
to make it, she found the Door was lock'd, that when her Lady gave   
her Notice of it once
or twice she kept out of the Way. Being asked, Whether it was usual  
for her to leave the
Room when Visiters came to her Lady? She replied, that she never did 
when she was
making the Bed; and that Visitors never came into her Lady's         
Chamber, but into the Dressing
Room. Being further ask'd, Whether, when her Lord was at home, she   
never saw my
Lord and Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> in my Lady's Chamber together? Replied, she  
never knew them
together there.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mary Hodson</font> deposed, That she lived two Years and two      
Months with the Lord
<font>Abergavenny</font> in Town and Country both, and served in the Family   
as a Laundery Maid; that as
she hath stood at her Window, which faces her Lady's Dressing-Room,  
she hath seen Mr.
<font>Lyddel</font> take her Lady by the Pinners and kissed her, that when he 
had pull'd her Lady away,
the Window-Shutters were one quarter or half shut too; that she hath 
observed this
several Times, taking her mostly by the Pinners, and kissing her;    
that she saw this very plainly,
the Shutters were shut more than once, even several Times. Being     
asked, How long after
he hath kissed her Lady, that she hath observed the Window-Shutters  
to be put too?
Replied, about a quarter of an Hour. Being asked, Whether these      
Observations were made in
Town? She reply'd, yes; the Building of the Laundery is a back       
Building cross the
Gravel Court, right against her Lady's Dressing-Room.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>William Smith</font> deposed, That he was Porter to my Lord       
<font>Abergavenny</font> , and that he was
ordered by his Lady, whenever Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> came to admit him, that 
she would not be at home
when Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> was there, but when Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> was gone his  
Lady would be at home
to any Body that came; that Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> was always admitted, and  
that was his Direction.
That when Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> hath been at his Lordship's, his Lordship   
and he have gone out
together, and he hath returned again before him, and gone to the     
Appartment of his Lady,
That Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> and a Gentleman have dined together with his     
Lady, went out together,
and Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> has returned again, and staid with his Lady two   
Hours; that when he came
he used to ask him, whether his Lady was at home; and if the Footman 
hath been out of
the way, he hath waited upon him himself to her Lady's Appartment;   
that he was always
admitted; when his Lord was at home he would go to his Lordship's    
Appartment, and
afterwards from his Lordship's to his Lady's. Being asked, Whether   
he ever knew him deny'd
when his Lord was at home? He reply'd, he never did.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Matthews</font> being called, was ask'd by the Plaintiff's     
Council, what Station he was in
under the Plaintiff, answered, That he was his Gentleman; and being  
desired to give an
Account to the Court of his seeing Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> and his Lady       
together in the Room, and what
he observed, replied, he had a great many Suspicions of a criminal   
Correspondence
between Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> and his Lady; that he had taken Notice that   
his Lady would order none
to be let in but Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> ; that one Evening his Lady said,    
she would be at home to none
but Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> ; That he went up and found none but Mr.          
<font>Lyddel</font> there with his Lady, and
only two Candles burning, then he went and brought up two others,    
that there might be
<pagebreak id="5" />
Light in the Room, that when he came to go into the Room the Door    
was fast; that he
heard his Lady run from the Couch to the Fire-side, which is but six 
Foot, she opened the
Door and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you fling the Door so hard you'll make the Bolt     
fly; </dialogue><nonSpeech>that when he came in
he saw Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> upon the Couch, as if he were putting up his   
Breeches; that he had since
flang'd the Door several Times, and found the Bolts not to fly. That 
when he went into
the Country he had several Pair of Leases to engross for his Lord's  
Tenants; that the
Appartment he lay in was under Mr. <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Mr,</comment> <font>Lyddel's</font> 
Room, called the <font>White Room</font> ; that one Morning,
as he was engrossing of Leases, he heard a Woman coming into that    
<font>White Room</font> ; that he
<comment type="compiler">WORD REPEATED: he</comment> heard the Voice of a Man, and presently heard  
the <font>White Room</font> Bed crack. This was
the first Morning, <font>October</font> the <font>13th</font> . That he says, he heard 
a Woman come into the <font>White
Room</font> , just over his Head; that he heard the Man, and heard the    
Bed crack, upon which
this Deponent declar'd himself to be in a great Surprize, but was    
resolved to see who came
out; that he went half way up the great Stairs, and saw Mr.          
<font>Lyddel</font> coming out of his
Room,</nonSpeech><dialogue> who desired me to call his Servant to him. </dialogue><nonSpeech>That running as 
hard as he could, he
met one of his Lord's Servants, and desired him to send Mr.          
<font>Lyddel's</font> Man up to his Master,
after which he went up the Back-Stairs through the Long Gallery, and 
saw his Lady come
out very red, and in Disorder, and thought she had been in Mr.       
<font>Lyddel's</font> Room. Being
asked, whether he afterwards met with her, and in what Room?         
Reply'd, that the next
Morning, the <font>14th</font> of <font>October</font> , he was then writing as        
before, and about nine a-Clock he
heard a Woman come in after the same Manner, and heard the Step of a 
Man, and the Bed
crack, as the Morning before; then he went up the Back-Stairs, and   
at the End of his Lord's
Gallery he took off his Wig, and laid himself down, that no Body     
might see him; that he
heard the Bolt of Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font> Door open, then he saw Mr.        
<font>Lyddel</font> come out of his
Chamber Door looking about him, and going in, immediately his Lady   
came out, with her
Hands spreading her Petticoats; that there was a Door at the End of  
the Gallery, from
whence he could see all along the Gallery. Being asked, whether from 
that Place where he
was he could hear the Door open? He reply'd, that he heard the Door  
unbolted, and he
saw Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> come out of his Room, and presently after he went 
in, and his Lady came
out holding her Petticoats on each Side, but when he saw her he got  
up with a Book  in his
Hand, as waiting his Lord's getting up in the Morning, which was his 
known Practice; that
then his Lady went into her own Dressing-Room. Being asked, whether  
his Lady came out
while Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> was at the Door? He reply'd, that he went in    
first, and then his Lady
came out. Being ask'd why she held her Petticoats after such a       
Manner? Reply'd, because
Mr. <font>Nevell</font> , that was in a Room hard by, should not hear the     
rustling of her Silks. The
next Day, being <font>Wednesday</font> , this Deponent was from Home, and     
could make no
Observation. That on <font>Thursday</font> he was in his Room, and heard the  
same Noise in the <font>White Room</font> ,
after the same Manner as he had done before. In the Afternoon of the 
same Day he
acquainted Mr. <font>Osman</font> , his Lord's Steward, for he said he could  
not bear to see his Lord
injured after such a Manner. He was asked, whether Mr. <font>Lyddel</font>    
came out of the Door and
look'd about him this Time, as he had done on the <font>Tuesday</font>        
before? He reply'd, that he did,
and that his Lady came out as before, but whether she went into the  
Nursery or into his
Lord's Appartment he was not certain. That on <font>Friday</font> , as he was 
writing again, he
prevailed with Mr. <font>Osman</font> to be present with him, and when they   
were together, he ask'd Mr.
<font>Osman</font> whether he did not hear some Body come in? He said, yes;   
and in a little Time they
heard a Bed crack; that this Deponent said to Mr. <font>Osman</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> in a 
little Time you'll hear the
Bolt of the Door make a Noise, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so it happened, for they being  
at the Bottom of the
great Stairs; Mr. <font>Osman</font> told him he heard it very plain, and saw 
the Lady come out of Mr.
<font>Lyddel's</font> Room, with her Petticoats held up by her Hand as she    
used to do, to prevent the
Gentleman that lodged by her from hearing her. That <font>Saturday</font>     
Morning was the same
Thing; that this Deponent and Mr. <font>Osman</font> heard and saw as before. 
Being ask'd what
Method he took in order to have it discovered? Replied, that he      
discoursed with Mr. <font>Osman</font> ,
and they consulted together what Method they should take, that       
several Mornings they had
had those Consultations; further, that he acquainted Mr. <font>Day</font>     
with it. It being ask'd, what
Conclusion they came to? He reply'd, it was agreed upon that their   
Lord should know of
it some way or other, they propos'd the Discovery should be made by  
his Lordship's
Mother, but she was under a great deal of Concern about it, and      
desired some Body else might
do it; that then they thought no Person so proper as Mr. <font>Day</font> to  
do it, who is a Neighbour
and Relation of his Lordship's. Mr. <font>Day</font> accepting of the         
Proposal did communicate it.
Being ask'd, when it was communicated to my Lord, what Answer did he 
give of what his
Lordship would do? He reply'd, that Mr. <font>Day</font> told him, that his   
Lordship</nonSpeech><dialogue> was willing
that we should surprize him in the very Act. </dialogue><nonSpeech>He gave this          
Direction to Mr. <font>Day</font> and Mr.
<font>Osman</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Method that we took was, that Mr. <font>Day</font> , Mr.    
<font>Osman</font> and myself were to
conceal our selves in a Closet, adjoining to the Room where Mr.      
<font>Lyddel</font> lay, and on the
<pagebreak id="6" />
8th of <font>November</font> last, about six in the Morning, we all placed    
our selves there; </dialogue><nonSpeech>that they
staid there till about nine, at which Time her Ladyship came into    
Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font> Room,
went round it, and was heard to say with a low Voice,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I cannot   
stay with you now</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>upon
which Mr. <font>Day</font> and Mr. <font>Osman</font> thinking her gone were for going 
away, but this Deponent
acquainting them that she was not, prevailed with them to stay, and  
he listning very close
heard a Noise, upon which they all went together into the Chamber,   
and coming softly to
the Bed-side withdrew the Curtains, upon which Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> cry'd  
out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>O God</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech>That this
Deponent saw her Ladyship in a very indecent Posture, and in a very  
great Surprize she said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Dear</font> Matthews <font>do not ruin me</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>upon which he said he was   
very sorry for what was done,
she repeated again,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Do not ruin me</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>he told her that he was 
sent by his Lord's Direction,
and that he must be true to his Lord. That Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> in his     
Surprize seem'd not to have
heard what was said, and therefore cry'd out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What do you        
say</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>This Deponent answered
him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir, I thought you could not have been guilty of so foul    
an Act</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>And Mr. <font>Osman</font> saying
to him;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>For you, Sir, to come so frequently, in such a Shew of   
Friendship, and to wrong his
Lordship after such a Manner as you have done, is a Crime for which  
you can make him no
Satisfaction</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>that Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>it is very true, 
I can make no Satisfaction</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he
said, he would take a Horse and ride away, and never return to his   
Lordship's House any
more. Then Mr. <font>Osman</font> said to him, it was his Lordship's          
Direction that he should be kept
there. This Deponent being ask'd, what Room this was in? Reply'd,    
that it was Mr.
<font>Lyddel's</font> Room; that they lay cross the Bed when they opened the  
Curtains. Being asked,
how many Days Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> was at his Lordship's at this Time? He  
reply'd, that he came
the 7th of <font>November</font> . Being asked, who he received his           
Instructions from; He reply'd,
from Mr. <font>Day</font> and Mr. <font>Osman</font> , and that his Lordship in his    
Instructions said to them when
he went to Bed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Be sure when you come into the Room; and if you  
find my Wife there, I
desire she may be used tenderly</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>that this was over Night, and  
they were taken together at nine
a-Clock the next Day. Being ask'd, what Directions his Lordship gave 
with respect to Mr.
<font>Lyddel</font> ? Reply'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>That in case we take them together in the  
Manner we found them; that then
I should come to Town, and give Orders to Mr.</font> Staples <font>to proceed 
against <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: againg</comment> him according to
Law</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Being ask'd, what was to be done with Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> in    
the mean while? Reply'd,
<font>That his Lordship gave Directions to secure him in the House till  
further Orders</font> . This
Deponent being asked, whether he went to <font>London</font> after this?      
Replied, yes, and went to Mr.
<font>Staples</font> , and made Affidavit of what he saw, upon which there    
was a Process taken out,
which this Deponent delivered to the Sheriff's Bayliff, and was      
executed on <font>Monday</font>
Morning; that then he supposes he was carry'd away to the County     
Jail. Being asked, what Orders
were given about his Lady's going? He replied, that he had no Orders 
about her, but she
went away on the <font>Saturday</font> after the Discovery, very big with     
Child.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Osman</font> depos'd, That Mr. <font>Matthews</font> came to him and    
expressed himself much
concerned, with Relation to the Intimacies he had observed betwixt   
Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> and his Lady,
and said, that Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> had abused his Lord, by lying with his 
Lady; and gave this
Deponent several Instances of it, as of his lighting Mr. <font>Lyddel</font>  
up into his Lady's Appartment,
and finding but two Candles he went down for two more, and returning 
found the Door
fast, and knocking at the Door, heard his Lady go from the Couch to  
the Fire-side, that when
his Lady had opened the Door she chid him for knocking so hard, that 
he then saw Mr.
<font>Lyddel</font> with his Hands in the Folds of his Clothes, and believed  
he was putting up his Breeches:
This was the 12th of <font>October</font> . On the 13th of <font>October</font> , as   
he was sitting in his Room
engrossing of Leases, he heard the Tread of a Man, then the Tread of 
a Woman, and in a
little Time after heard the Bed crack, and being willing to be       
better satisfy'd, he went out
of his Room, and went up the great Stairs, and when he was half way  
up, Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> came
out of his Chamber, and ordered him to call his Man to him, but      
meeting with one of his
Fellow-Servants delivered the Message to him, afterwards he took to  
a back Pair of Stairs,
and met his Lady just against the Nursery Room, the back Part of the 
Gallery, in very
great Disorder, and that he believed she had been in Mr.             
<font>Lyddel's</font> Room. This Deponent
further says, that Mr. <font>Matthews</font> told him, that (the next Day     
being <font>Wednesday</font> he was out
of the way) on <font>Thursday</font> Morning Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> and his Lady had  
the same
Conversation as before; then Mr. <font>Matthews</font> desired this Deponent, 
that he would be with
him the next Morning, being <font>Friday</font> , accordingly he went to Mr.  
<font>Matthew's</font> Room in the
Morning, and had not been there long but he heard a softly Tread     
coming out of the
Green Room into Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font> Bed-Chamber, and in a little Time   
he heard the Bed
crack pretty often; that Mr. <font>Matthews</font> carry'd this Deponent to   
the Bottom of the great
Stairs, where he heard the Door unbolt, and Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> step out, 
as he supposed, to see
whether all was clear, and after he was gone in, the Lady came out   
with her Petticoats up,
which he supposed was to keep them from rustling, there being a      
Gentleman lying in a
Room on the other Side of the Gallery, at the Top of the great       
Stairs. This Deponent
<pagebreak id="7" />
further said, that he heard the same on <font>Saturday</font> Morning as he   
had done before; that he was
very much concerned and surprized at the Observation of these        
Passages, and to find his
Lord abused after so gross a Manner, for he believed, that his       
Lordship was a tender a
Husband, and had as great a Value for his wife as any Person in the  
world, and that none
could be more fond; and though they knew it would be a great         
Affliction to their Lord,
were notwithstanding resolv'd to acquaint him with it, for they      
could have no Peace in
their own Consciences while they kept it as a Secret from him; to    
which End Mr. <font>Day</font>
was acquainted with it, he accepted of the Office, and acquainted    
his Lordship with it on
the sixth of <font>November</font> last, after this Manner; &quot;He desired his   
Lordship would be pleased
to walk in the Fields with him, for he had something to communicate  
to him, but his
Lordship being very pressing to know what it was, Mr. <font>Day</font>        
opened it to him; his
Lordship was extreamly concerned that his Friend had done such a     
Thing, and said <font>He could
not have done so to him</font> .&quot; Then his Lordship gave Directions to    
make Discovery, which
was after this Manner:</nonSpeech><dialogue> we proposed early the next Morning to go    
into a Closet that joined
to the Room where Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> lay, which we accordingly did;      
</dialogue><nonSpeech>that this Deponent being
placed against the Closet Door could see the Room, and had such a    
a Command of it that no
Body could go in or come out but what he must see; that a little     
after eight a-Clock Mr.
<font>Lyddel's</font> Man went into the Room, and as he was coming out, his   
Master being in Bed,
says to him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Are your Rasors ready, for I shall shave my self    
by and by</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Man went
out of the Room, and at nine a-Clock his Lady came along the Gallery 
to Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font>
Door, and entered the Chamber; that he saw her through the Key-hole, 
when she came
against it she made a Stop, and then went to Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font>        
Bed-side, and said something
to him; then she returned, which made this Deponent conclude she was 
gone quite away,
likewise Mr. <font>Day</font> said she was gone, but Mr. <font>Matthews</font> was of  
another Mind, and went
and opened Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font> Door, and stept to the Bed and undrew    
the Curtains of the 
Bed-side, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>So then</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech>the Lady was lying upon her    
Back a-cross the Bed, and her Clothes
by that Time this Deponent came was down to her Knees, that he saw   
her Legs; and that
Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> had nothing but his Shirt on; that she used several   
Expressions in great Surprize,
and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I shall be ruined</font> , but we told her we were there by 
his Lordship's Direction; </dialogue><nonSpeech>that
Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> raised himself up and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What is the Matter? I 
have heard nothing you have
said</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then this Deponent said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>We come to observe the vile  
Treatment you have used towards
my Lord, and for this you can never give his Lordship                 
Satisfaction</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>He said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>It is very true,
I'll take my Horse and go away, and never return more</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>upon     
which this Deponent said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>You had as good stay while you are here</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>Being desired to     
give an Account of the Friendship
which was between his Lordship and Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> , he said, that    
the Friendship was very great,
that his Lordship always received Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> with a great deal   
of Pleasure and Satisfaction,
that there was as good a Provision made for him by his Lordship, as  
for any Body that came
to his House, that it was his Opinion that his Lordship's Secrets    
were communicated to him,
and that he never knew of greater Friendship and Intimacy than there 
was betwixt his
Lordship and Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> . Being asked, when her Ladyship went    
away after the Discovery? He
reply'd, She went away at three a-Clock the Day of Discovery, by his 
Lordship's Order, to
General <font>Tatton</font> her Father.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>James</font> depos'd, That at the Desire of the Lady, he went  
into Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font> Room on
<font>Saturday</font> Morning, on the 8th of <font>November</font> last, after the     
Discovery was made, that when
he came into the Room he found Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> in a great Confusion   
and Disorder, saying</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I
am a vile Wretch; for God's Sake do not speak to me; for God's Sake  
do not speak to me</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Day</font> deposed, That he was his Lordship's Steward, and    
took Care of his Estates in
several Counties, that he observed the Intimacy between his Lord and 
Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> , and in
his Esteem his Lordship was the greatest Friend Mr. <font>Lyddel</font> had   
in the world, that there was
as intire Friendship betwixt them as ever was amongst Men, and that  
their mutual
Respect for each other was very strong, so that this Deponent was    
surprized when Mr.
<font>Matthews</font> let him into some of the Secrets of his Lady and Mr.    
<font>Lyddel's</font> Intimacy, the first of
which was about the Month of <font>March</font> last; that he could not       
conceive that Mr. <font>Lyddel</font>
would be guilty of so foul a Crime, when he knew the Intimacy that   
was between his
Lord and him; he could not give Credit to those Reports till the     
Account they gave him
of the Observations they made in the five Mornings, that then this   
Deponent did believe it,
and that they fixed upon him to discover it to his Lordship, which   
he did upon the 6th of
<font>November</font> ; that he asked his Lordship, <font>Whether, considering    
the great Affection he had for
his Lady, he could bear the Discovery of it</font> ? That this Deponent   
proposed the Method of the
Discovery which his Lordship approved of, and what he did by his     
Lordship's Orders.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Council for the Defendant acknowledged, that a Verdict      
ought to be given against
the Defendant, but used divers Arguments for Mitigation of the       
Damages, as that the
Damages ought to be proportioned to the Circumstances of the Person  
offending, that it lies
<pagebreak id="8" />
before the Jury, to give more or less, according to Circumstances    
That the Defendant's
Estate is only an Estate for Life, and under great Incumbrances.     
Another Argument was
offered, that this Action was not laid for an Assault in debauching  
the Plaintiff's Lady, but for
destroying the Health, Satisfaction and Comfort of the Plaintiff,    
that from the Time the
Fact was committed to the Time of her Death, was so short, that the  
Injury his Lordship
sustain'd in his Health could not be very great. Another Argument    
was the Lady's coming
into Mr. <font>Lyddel's</font> Chamber, by which Means she became a           
Temptation to him, and was
a Temptation hard to be resisted; That this Fact between Mr.         
<font>Liddel</font> and the Lady might
have been as well prevented as discovered, if they had thought fit,  
but that it seem'd as if
an Agreement was made to lay a Snare and Temptation to draw him into 
a Criminal Action.
Another Argument is, that his present Affliction is a great          
Punishment to him, and that even
the witnesses for the Plaintiff say, that he thought himself the     
most miserable wretch living,
and if so, then what must his Affliction be now, that he ought to be 
considered as a very
unfortunate and unhappy Person, upon which Account there is no       
Reason to charge much
Damages, as to be the total Ruin of him who is miserable enough      
already.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>There were several Lords and Gentlemen appear'd to his          
Reputation, who gave him the
Character of a very civil, modest, well-bred Gentleman, and could    
never have thought he
would have been guilty of any Thing of this Nature. There were       
several Mortgage Deeds
produced in Court, upon the Estate of the Defendant, amounting to    
11000 l.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Council for the Plaintiff in their Reply urged, That the    
Damage ought not to be
calculated from the Time the Fact was committed to his Lady's Death, 
the Consideration of
the Damages ought to regard Futurity; that when once the Ties of     
mutual Love is broken,
it can never be repaired; and if they had not been detected they     
might have gone on with
Impunity. As to the Plea made Use of, that his Estate is not capable 
of paying large
Damages, a Case was mentioned of a Footman for the like Crime, who   
was fined 5000 l. for
it is but reasonable, if a Person destroys the Happiness of another  
his Happiness ought to be
disturbed as long as he lives. There is a standing Law against       
Adultery, the Adulteress and
Adulterer too is to be put to Death. There is nothing here can make  
Satisfaction but a
Pecuniary Punishment.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Upon the whole the Jury withdrew, and after a short Stay        
brought in their Verdict for
the Plaintiff, 10000 <font>l.</font> Damages.</nonSpeech>
