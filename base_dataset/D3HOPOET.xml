 <head>THE DOWNEFALL OF TEMPORISING POETS, 
PRINTERS, BOOKE-SELLERS, TROTTING MERCURIES, AND 
BAWLING HAWKERS: EXPRESSED IN A DIALOGUE, BETWEEN 
LIGHTFOOT THE MERCURY, AND SUCK-BOTTLE THE 
HAWKER: RED-NOSE THE POET 
BEING MODERATOR.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Light-foot.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now <font>Suck-bottle</font> , how goes the world
with you? me-thinkes you are growne
very wist of late, thy cheekes looke as
thin as a Shrove-tuesday pan-cake; surely thou hast oft the
priviledge of the Ale-tap, or will mother <font>Nip</font> at the bunch
of Grapes score no longer? Tell me the cause of thy
dejected countenance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suck-bottle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A pox on you <font>Lightfoot</font> , if it had     
not beene
for you I might have beene now merry and frolicke, with
my pipe and my pot; but now alas the case is altered: the
Fidlers go a begging.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lightf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirrah <font>Suck-bottle</font> , doe not you lay the    
cause of
your downfull upon me, for if it had not beene for your
tearing throat, my basket with papers would have filld my
<pagebreak id="2" />
purse with crownes; whereas now I could scarce get money
enough to buy shooes to trot from the Exchange to
Westminster, and from Westminster to the Old Bayly, from
the Old Bayly to Pauls Church-yard, and from thence to
Westminster againe: it is well known to the whole world,
that what we got wee tooke paines for, like true Adamites
we got our living by the sweat of our browes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suck-B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were true Adamites indeed; for some of
you had scarce cloathes enow to cover your nakednesse; it
was better sport than to see a Beare-bayting, to heare a
male and female Mercury scolding together. I once                    
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: oncc</comment> going
in Smithfield, one calld rogue, the other whore; one
comming by wisht the Divell to take them both: the woman
with her tippet standing up, her tongue being almost
weary with Billingsgate worke, going out of doores, chanced
to slip, and in stead of a womans smock, shewed a mans
shirt on her backe. And this is the gentility of your
worshipfull <font>Mercuries</font> , both male and female: and then to
make up the matter, you solely endeavored to pull down the
admirable Corporation, or rather Bacchanalian Society of
most reverend wandring Stationers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lightf.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may well call your selves wandring
Stationers, for there was scarce one of you that could say, at such a
house I will lodge to night: one of you came out of a hedge,
another out of New-gate, a third out of the New-prison,
and the fourth not beeing above a moneth out of Bedlam,
roundly, profoundly, and soundly cries out with a voyce
made of cannon proofe, <font>Come buy a new Booke, a new Booke,
newly come forth</font> ; these are the most admirable proprieties
which belong to your most admired Corporation.
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suck-b.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Light foot</font> , cease thy rayling,             
<font>Light foot</font> look
where <font>How now Mars</font> comes, the Regent Master of all
Ballad-singers, he who thinkes his Muse came from
<font>Helicon</font> , when as it is well knowne the first originall of it
was taken out of a Tan-pit, I say, let this worthy Patron
of Strangullion Poetry moderate the cause, betwixt us
two, for why, we are both at variance.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Enter <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is the matter most worthy Gentlemen?
me thinkes yee should rather deplore one anothers late
misfortunes, than to deride at each others misery, I
privately heard all your discourse, which will be a laughter
to the whole world.
   You Master <font>Light-foot</font> call Master <font>Suck-bottle</font> Knave,
and Master <font>Suck-bottle</font> calls you Knave, and as for my
part, I thinke yee are both Knaves, for why, neither of
yee both deal honestly, I will shew you a reason for it,
as for you Mercuries, instead of binding of Bibles you
have chang'd your Trades to binde one another to that
you never had, your good behaviours I mean, moreover
there are amongst you double dealers, for why? you
have been meer Male and Female, one upon another.
now for you Gentlemen Hawkers, or rather wandering
Book-sellers, whose mouthes are like open sepulchres,
for why? they are alwayes gaping, as for your hands,
they are open also to take money, when yee can get it,
yee are beholding to traiters, for had they not been bad,
you had never took so much good money.
<pagebreak id="4" />
But who was the better for it? not your selves I am sure:
for why, you have spent it all at the Ale-house; and now,
be it spoken to each one of your comforts, the next time
you cry books about London, your reward shall be the
whipping post; for why, there must be nothing sold
without License.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light-f.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Master Poet, your tongue runnes before your
wit, you tell us of our faults, but never looke upon your
own. I saw the other day a Poet in print, shiting out of the
Divels breech: you are very religious men, rather than you
will lose halfe a crowne, you will write against your owne
Fathers. You will make mens wills before they be sicke,
and hang them before they are in prison, and cut off heads
before you know why or wherefore. You have an
indifferent strong Corporation: 23 of you sufficient writers,
besides <font>Martin Parker</font> . This alteration notwithstanding hath
made all your breeches make buttons: two or three of you
if they had not trusted unto their legges, it is ten to one if
they had not taken acquaintance with the Gate-house, and
then have lent the Pillory an eare or two. I thinke Master
Poet I am even with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sawcy <font>Mercury</font> , the arrantest knave of forty, 
if it
had not been for us Poets, your wives petticoats had not
been so laced, nor you blacke cloaked: wee shall have you
shortly cry a poxe on the Printer, and then go hang your
selves, and save yong <font>Gregory</font> a labour. There is a zealous
Brother neere Warwicke lane, will helpe you to make up
the number finely.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suck b.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Master Poet, let me desire you to cease, I have
heard you thus long with patience, let us all three bee
<pagebreak id="5" />
friends, and be brothers in adversity I am the oldest
Hawker amongst two hundred threescore and seventeen honest
men and true, come, how say you, are we friends?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well spoken <font>Sim Suck-bottle</font> , I were not
worthy the name of a Poet if I would not condescend to be
friends, so the band of amity were made in an Ale-house
or a Taverne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.f.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any money Poet?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Money? I wonder when you ever see Poets
have money two dayes together, I sold a copy last night,
and have spent the money, and now have another copy to
sell, but a pox on't, nobody will buy it because it is not
licenceable, come, I know thou hast money <font>Light foot</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light-f.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By this light not I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor you <font>Suck-bottle</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suck-B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why I? I was drunke last night, and never a
new booke being out to day, I am quite broke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then here be three broken gentlemen of us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Light.f.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thy fall O Poet, makes poor <font>Light foot</font> mad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Suck.b.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thy fall O Poet, makes <font>Suck bottle</font> sad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Poet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Mercuries be mad, and Hawkers sad,
I'me sure no reason I have to be glad.
Farewell kinde Brothers, 'tis a cursed fate,
One hour should make five so unfortunate,
Poet, Book-seller, Mercury, Hawker,
And Printer, which but lately was a talker,
How much he got, but fortune late hath frown'd,
All five are falne, all five do kisse the ground.
