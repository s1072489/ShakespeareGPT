 <head> <comment type="editor">LXIX. CHRISTOPHER BRAMLEY. FOR BRAWLING IN A
CHURCH.</comment> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>March 28, 1655. Before Thomas Dickinson, Esq. <font>Josiah Hunter,
minister of both Ouseburnes</font> , saith, that, upon the last Lord's    
day,
being 25th of March instant, one Christopher Bramley, of
Whixley, came, as he had done severall Sundays before, to the 
parish church of Litle Ouseburne at the time of morning service,
when he said to the informant, passing by him into the church,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
&quot;Thou art going into the throne of pride;&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and afterwards,
being in the church he, the said Christopher Bramley, most
irreverently behaved himselfe, not moving his hat all the time of
the first prayer and singing of psalmes before sermon, but sat in
the porch and spake to diverse as they came in, to the disturbance 
of them; and, after the informant had nominated his text, which
was 119 Ps., 105, &quot;Thy word is a lampe unto my feete and a
light unto my path,&quot; he the said Bramley standing up said, in
the hearing of the informant and one William Peele, &quot;Where
was the word? the word was not then written or but in writing;&quot;
with much more that could not be distinctly heard by reason of
the noise of the people, who, being greatly disturbed as well as
the informant, rose up in their seates and turnd themselves
towards him who made the disturbance. Immediately the
churchwarden put him the said Bramley out of the porch and
lockd the doore upon him, yet he came againe and cast in a 
paper through a hole in the doore conteining much slanderous
and reviling matter, which appears by the writing ready to be
produced by the informer upon demand. The informant saith
likewise that, about sixe weekes agoe, he the said Bramley came
on the Lord's day in the afternoone into the parish-church of
Great Ousburne in the time of sermon, when and where he did
<pagebreak id="72" />
likewise not a little disturb the informant preaching on that place,
of Scripture 8 Luke, 18, &quot;Take heed how you heare,&quot; audiblye
contradicting the informant with words to this purpose,</nonSpeech><dialogue> &quot;Thou
hast noe such command or authoritye.&quot; </dialogue><nonSpeech>After sermon alsoe he
stood in a daring manner in the time of prayer and singing part
of a psalme and giving the blessing, and afterwards remained
most of an houre in the churchyard, labouring still to cause more
disturbance, and deteining many people about him, as if it had
been a place of marketting, to the great abuse of the Lord's
day &amp;c.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Aug. 11, 1655. Before Edward Briggs, Esq. <font>Thomas
Waller, of Brough</font> , saith, that one Charles Kilpin, of Crosbie
Ravenside, clarke, hath beene an enimie against the 
Commonwealth ever since the begininge of these unhappie distraccions;
and he did confesse, in this informant's heareinge, that he was
a private intelligencer by the State in the yeare 1648; and, a litle
before this last insurrection, this informer heard him say in
February last that the Lord Protector was a traitor, for he had taken
away the King's life, and hoped in a litle time that the Lord
Protector and all that tooke his parte would come to a shamefull
end, and that they were but rogues and theeves that tooke his
parte. And the said Charles Kilpin hath passed severall times
to and from the toppe of Stainemore to meet his brother Tobie
Kiplin, another grand enimie against the State, about a month or
three weekes before the insurrection, with a resolution, as this
informant verily believes, to know when the Yorkshire and
Bishopricke men would rise.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <comment type="editor">LXXI. JOHN LOFT. FOR BRAWLING IN CHURCH.</comment> </head>

Wood, came into the church of Newton Kime, in the tyme of
divine service, and duringe the tyme of praier before the sermon
<pagebreak id="73" />

was an hyrelinge and preached for wages. He was carryed forth
of the church by the constable and churchwardens there.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <comment type="editor">LXXII. WM. AND JAMES RICHARDSON. FOR SEDITIOUS WORDS.</comment> </head> 

   <nonSpeech>Aug. 13, 1655. Before Edward Briggs, Esq. <font>Margaret
Eubanke, of Stainemore, and Captain Thomas Eubanke, her
husband</font> , say, that, on the 20th February last, beinge with
Wm. Richardson, minister of Brough, and James Richardson,
his brother, they said that both her husband and she would lose
both life, lands, and goods, within a little time, and all the rest
of the Parliament's party that have beene against the Kinge, the
lawfull heire of this kingdome, unlesse they would revolt within
three moneths time. They would be laid lower then ever yet,

suffered too longe.</nonSpeech>

Esqrs. <font>John Ardsey, clerke, and Robert Miller</font> , say, that they
heard Richard Browne, of Cleaburne (co. Westmerland), say
that the army were all plunderinge rogues and cowards, and that
they had never comed to the passe they were at, but only that
their army (meaninge the King's army which he was in) had
some or other in it still to betray them, but he hoped to see an
ill day for them all. And that he said the Lord Protector was a
murtherer, and, if he and his states had their due deserts, they
deserved all to be either hanged or headed, for they had both
headed the Kinge, and hanged many gallant and better men than
themselves, only for gettinge their estates, that they might live in
pride, as now they did, and kept a company of rogues, excisemen,
and, such like, to abuse the country still. And that he further
sayd that if he did but know how to come privatly to the Lord
Protector, and his states, that it might not be knowne, he did
<pagebreak id="74" />
sweare, God d--- him, body and soule, if he would not cutt all
their throats; and againe he wished that he had them all in an
hott burninge oven, he did sweare againe, God confound him, if
he would not sett up the stone and burne them all to death. All
which words were spoken by the said Browne, upon the 26th day
of June, 1655.</nonSpeech>

of his chaps. Soe, an action beinge brought against the said
Benton for the trespass, which was submitted unto by him, and
indevors used to end the difference, which was composed, and
satisfaction given unto the said Craven. After which, the said
Jennett Benton and her sonn did say that it should be a deare
day's worke unto the said Rich. Jackson, to him or to his, before
the yeare went about. Since which time his wife haith had her
hearinge taken from her; a childe strangely taken with fitts in
the night time; himselfe alsoe, beinge formerly of helthfull body,
have beene sudenly taken without any probable reason to be given
or naturall cause appearinge, beinge sometimes in such extremity
that he conceived himselfe drawne in peices at the hart, backe,
and shoulders. And, in the begininge of these fits, the first night,
he heard a greate noyse of musicke and dancinge about him. The
next night, about twelve of the clocke, he was taken with another
fitt, and, in the midle of it, he conceved there was a noyse like
ringinge of small bells, with singinge and dancinge, and sometimes
both nights a noise of deepe groneing; upon which he called of
