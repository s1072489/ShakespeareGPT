 <head>A DIALOGUE 
UPON THE
GARDENS <font>OF THE RIGHT HOUNOURABLE 
THE</font> LORD VISCOUNT COBHAM, &amp;C.</head> 

<nonSpeech>POLYPTHON was a
Gentleman engaged in a way of Life,
that excused him two Months in
the Year from Business; which 
Time he used generally to spend in visiting
what was curious in the several Counties
around him. As he had long promised his
Friend <font>Callophilus</font> to pass away his 
Vacancy, at some time or other, in 
<font>Buckinghamshire</font> , he determined upon it this Year,
and accordingly paid him a Visit at * * *.
<font>Stow</font> was one of the first Places where his
Curiosity carried him; and indeed he had
<pagebreak id="2" />
scarce got his Foot within the 
Garden-door, before he broke out into the 
following Exclamation.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   Why, here is a View that gives me a
kind of Earnest of what my Expectation is
raised to!

   It is a very fine one indeed </dialogue><nonSpeech> (replied 
<font>Callophilus</font> :) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not wonder it should
catch your Sight: The old Ruin upon the 
left of the Canal, the Opening to the 
Pyramid, the View towards the House, the
River, the beautiful Disposition of the 
Trees on the other side of it, and that
venerable old Temple, make a fine Variety
of Objects. But your Eye is so taken up
with Views at a distance, that you neglect
something here at hand very well worth
your notice. What do you think of these
two Pavilions?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why really they are light, 
genteel Buildings enough. I like these rough
Paintings too; they are done in a very 
free, masterly Manner. Pray, Sir, do you
know the Stories?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are both taken from <font>Pastor
Fido</font> ; the disconsolate Nymph there, poor
<font>Dorinda</font> , had long been in love with 
<pagebreak id="3" />
<font>Sylvio</font> , a wild Hunter, of barbarous Manners,
in whose Breast she had no reason to believe 
she had raised an answering Passion. As
she was roving in the Woods, she
accidentally met his Dog, and saw her beloved
Hunter himself at a distance hollowing, and
running after it. She immediately calls the
Hound to her, and hides it amongst the
Bushes. <font>Sylvio</font> comes up to her, and
enquires very eagerly after his Dog: The
poor Nymph puts him off, and tries all her
Art to inspire him with Love, but to no
purpose; the cold Youth was quite
insensible, and his Thoughts could admit no
other Object but his Dog. Almost 
despairing, she at length hopes to bribe his
Affections, and lets him know she has his
Dog, which she will return if he will
promise to love her, and give her a Kiss;
<font>Sylvio</font> is overjoyed at the Proposal, and 
promises to give her ten thousand Kisses.
<font>Dorinda</font> upon this brings the Dog: but
alas! see there the Success of all her Pains:
the Youth transported at the Sight of his
Dog, throws his Arms round its Neck, and
lavishes upon it those Kisses and
Endearments, in the very Sight of the poor
afflicted Lady, which she had been flattering
herself would have fallen to her share. --
On this other Wall Disdain and Love have
taken different Sides; the Youth is warm,
<pagebreak id="4" />
and the Nymph is coy: Poor <font>Myrtillo</font> had
long loved <font>Amarillis</font> ; the Lady was
engaged to another, and rejected his Passion.
Gladly would he only have spoke his Grief,
but the cruel fair One absolutely forbid him
her Presence. At length a Scheme was
laid by <font>Corisca</font> , the young Lover's 
Confidant, which was to gain him Admission
into his dear <font>Amarillis's</font> Company. The
Lady is enticed into the Fields with some
of <font>Corisca's</font> Companions, (who were let
into the Plot) to play at Blindman's Buff,
where <font>Myrtillo</font> was to surprize her. See
there he stands hesitating what use to make
of so favourable an Opportunity, which 
Love has put into his Hands. -- If you 
have satisfied your Curiosity here, let us
walk towards the Temple of <font>Venus</font> . But
hold: we had better first go down towards
that Wilderness, and take a View of the
Lake.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Word here is a noble 
Piece of Water!

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not many Years ago I 
remember it only a Marsh: it surprized me
prodigiously when I first saw it floated in this
manner with a Lake. Observe, pray, what
a fine Effect that old Ruin has at the Head
of it: Its Ornaments too, the Cascade,
<pagebreak id="5" />
the Trees and Shrubs, half concealing, and
half discovering the ragged View, and the
Obelisk rising beyond it, are Objects 
happily disposed.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, indeed, I think the Ruin
a great Addition to the Beauty of the 
Lake. There is something so vastly
picturesque, and pleasing to the Imagination in
such Objects, that they are a great
Addition to every Landskip. And yet perhaps it
would be hard to assign a reason, why we are
more taken with Prospects of this ruinous
kind, than with Views of Plenty and
Prosperity in their greatest Perfection: 
Benevolence and Good-nature, methinks, are
more concerned in the latter kind.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: but cannot you make a
distinction between natural and moral
Beauties? Our social Affections undoubtedly
find their Enjoyment the most compleat
when they contemplate, a Country 
smiling in the midst of Plenty, where Houses
are well-built, Plantations regular, and 
every thing the most commodious and 
useful. But such Regularity and Exactness
excites no manner of Pleasure in the
Imagination, unless they are made use of to
contrast with something of an opposite 
kind. The Fancy is struck by <font>Nature</font>
<pagebreak id="6" />
alone; and if <font>Art</font> does any thing more
than improve her, we think she grows
impertinent, and wish she had left off a little
sooner. Thus a regular Building perhaps
gives us very little pleasure; and yet a fine
Rock, beautifully set off in <foreign>Claro-obscuro</foreign> , 
and garnished with flourishing Bushes, Ivy,
and dead Branches, may afford us a great
deal; and a ragged Ruin, with venerable
old Oaks, and Pines nodding over it, may
perhaps please the Fancy yet more than 
either of the other two Objects. -- Yon old
Hermitage, situated in the midst of this
delightful Wilderness, has an exceeding good
Effect: it is of the romantick Kind; and
Beauties of this sort, where a probable
Nature is not exceeded, are generally pleasing.
-- This Opening will lead us again into 
the Terrace. -- That large Building <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Bulding</comment> , the 
Inscription lets you see, is a Temple dedicated
to <font>Venus</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Word a Master has 
been at work here! I cannot say I have
met with any modern Touching, this long 
time, that has pleased me better. I see very
little to be cavilled at, with regard either
to the Design, Colouring, or Drawing.
These Stories are taken from the 
<font>Fairy-Queen</font> I dare say; they look like <font>Spencer's</font>
Ideas.
<pagebreak id="7" />

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: that Lady is the fair
<font>Hellinore</font> , who having left a disagreeable
Husband, and wandering in the Woods, was
met by the polite Sett of Gentry she is
dancing with: She likes their Manner of
Life, and resolves to enjoy it with them.
Her old Spouse <font>Malbecco</font> is inconsolable
for his Loss: he wanders many Days in
search of her, and at length finds her (you
see him at a distance peeping from behind
a Tree) revelling with a beastly Herd of
Satyrs. When the Evening comes on, he
follows the Company to their Retirement, 
takes a commodious stand, and to his great
Torment sees every thing that passes among
them. After they were all laid asleep, he
creeps gently to his Lady, and you see him
in the other Painting offering to be 
reconciled to her again, if she will return back
with him. But <font>Hellinore</font> threatens to 
awake the Satyrs, and get him severely
handled if he does not immediately leave her.
Upon which the poor Cuckold is obliged
to fly, and soon after runs distracted.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This loose Story, these
luxurious Couches, and the Embellishments
round the Walls, give the Place quite a 
<font>Cyprian</font> Air, and make it a very proper Retreat
for its incontinent Inhabitant upon the
<pagebreak id="8" />
Roof. -- But let us move forward towards
yon cubico-pyramidical Building. It looks
like a mighty substantial one: I fancy it is
Sir <font>John's</font> ; he is generally pretty liberal of
his Stone. However, it terminates this
Terrace extremely well: the Ascent up to
it too has a good Effect. -- Pray, do you
know what that Field there, upon the right, 
is to be improved into?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am surprized the Beauty of it,
in its present Form, does not strike you at
first sight. It is designed, like a Glass of
Bitters before Dinner, to quicken your
Appetite for the elegant Entertainment that
is to follow. For my part, I assure you,
I find it a very great Relief to my Eye, to
take it from these grand Objects, and cast it
for a few Minutes upon such a rural Scene
as this. Do not you think that Haycock
contrasts extremely well with this Temple?
Such Oppositions, in my Opinion, are
highly pleasing. -- That Building there is
called, <font>The Belvidere</font> . Whatever you may 
think of it, from this Stand, it has its Use,
I assure you, in several Prospects in the
Gardens. -- There is a very good Copy of
the <font>Roman</font> Boxers.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like its Situation extreamly:
it terminates these Alleys, and that Opening
<pagebreak id="9" />
from the Terrace, very beautifully; much
better, I think, than the fighting 
Gladiator, and <font>Sampson</font> killing the <font>Philistine</font> ,
do that other vast Terrace; the Objects
there, in my Opinion, are too small for
the Distance: Here both are justly 
proportioned.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Criticism, I think, is 
rather too refined: I cannot see what occasion
there is always for a confined View; a more
open one sometimes makes Variety.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You mistake me: I am not
against a Prospect's being bounded even by
the blue Hills in the Country. All I mean
is this, that where Objects are set up to 
terminate a View, they ought to be of such a
Nature as to afford Pleasure at any Distance 
they are designed to be viewed from. These
Statues I have been mentioning, are 
Objects so small, that at one end of the 
Terrace it is impossible to make out what is
offered you at the other. -- I have too
much Envy in my Temper, you must know,
to bear to see any thing perfect; and I came
in here fully determined to cavil, if I saw
the least Grounds. But this is a sad Place,
I find, for a malicious Spirit to enter: He
whose chief <font>Entertainment</font> is finding fault,
will here meet with a very slender <font>Repast</font> :
<pagebreak id="10" />
As the Devil did at Sight of the Creation,
in spite of Envy he must cry out,

<comment type="compiler">10 LINES OF VERSE OMITTED.</comment>

But what have we got here?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the Building we took
notice of from the Temple of <font>Venus</font> . I 
know you are no Friend to a cloathed
Statue; so I question whether you will meet
with any thing here to your Taste.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is something extremely
grand and noble, I have always thought, in
several of the old cloathed Statues, and
particularly in some of the <font>Roman</font> consular
ones; yet I must confess I am always better 
pleased when I find them without their
Finery. Marble, tho' admirably fitted to 
express the Roundness of a Muscle, very
often fails when it attempts to give you the
<pagebreak id="11" />
Folds of Drapery. The Ancients, it must
be owned, even in their Draperies are often
successful; but amongst our modern
Attempts in this Way, how many horrid Pieces
of Rock-work have I beheld!

<comment type="compiler">2 LINES OF LATIN OMITTED.</comment>

<font>Michael Angelo</font> , whenever he found
himself obliged to cloath his Statues, used to do
it with wet Linnen; which is 
unquestionably the most advantageous kind of
Cloathing for a Statue.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since you are not to be pleased
here, let us pass on to something else. There
is no Occasion to turn down to that
Pyramid; it is an Object not designed to be
viewed at a Yard's Distance; but you will
see its Use by and by, in a Variety of 
beautiful Views: Let us pursue our Walk along
this Terrace.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why here we entirely lose
sight of the Garden; our elegant Prospects 
are all vanished: I cannot conceive what
this impertinent Hedge does here.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you never experience in a 
Concert vast Pleasure when the whole Band
<pagebreak id="12" />
for a few Moments made a full Pause? The Case
is parallel: You have already had a great many
fine Views, and that you may not be cloyed,
this Hedge steps in to keep your Attention
awake. One Extreme recommends 
another: The Moralists observe, that a
little Adversity quickens our Relish for the 
Enjoyment of Life; and it is the Man of
Taste's Care not to distribute his Beauties
with too profuse a Hand, for a Reason of
the same kind.

   <font>Let not each Beauty every where be spy'd,
   Where half the Skill is decently to hide.</font>

But if you must have something to look at,
the Park there upon your left Hand affords
you some very fine Views. I like that
Equestrian Statue extremely: It is, in my Opinion,
a very beautiful Circumstance. What a
Number of fine Vistas it terminates thro' the
Trees, varying its Appearance in each of 
them. -- There you have a charming View
struck out towards the Temple of Ancient
Virtue.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks that Statue of the 
Faun stands a little aukwardly: He might
at least, I should think, have fixed himself
in the Middle of the Semi-circle.
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not certainly attend to
his Use: He stands there to receive the Eye
placed at the other End of that Opening. --
That elegant little Building I think they call
<font>Nelson's</font> Seat.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Painting is done masterly
enough: The Inscriptions, I see, explain the
Designs. Those Boys fixing the Trophies
are prettily imagined. From hence that
round Building terminates the View
extremely well. Let us walk to it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold -- turn to the Right a 
little: We must first pay a Visit here to the
Temple of <font>Bacchus</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have had a pretty long
Walk, suppose we sit down here a
Moment: These Walls seem to promise us
some Entertainment.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here, Sir, you see represented
the Triumphs and Happiness of 
Drunkenness. Those musical Ladies too are not
improper Companions to this
mirthfully-disposed Deity.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some of those smaller Figures 
are really done extremely well: And those 
two Vases are delightfully touched. I 
<pagebreak id="14" />
cannot say I am so much pleased with the jolly
Inhabitant: Even <font>Bacchus</font> himself certainly
never made so enormous a Figure.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am admiring the fine View
from hence: So great a Variety of beautiful
Objects, and all so happily disposed, make
a most delightful Picture. Don't you think
this Building too is a very genteel one, and
is extremely well situated? These Trees give
it an agreeable, cool Air, and make it, I
think, as elegant a Retreat for the 
Enjoyment of a Summer's Evening, as can well
be imagined. -- But it is mere trifling to sit
here: Let us walk towards the Rotunda. --
This little Alley will carry us to <font>Dido's</font>
Cave.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Dido's</font> Cave! why 'tis built
of hewn Stone! Here she is however, and
her <font>pious</font> Companion along with her.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those two Cupids joining their
Torches, I never see but I admire extremely:
they are very finely painted.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think they are indeed. But 
let us be a little complaisant, and not
interrupt these kind Lovers too long. I want
to see this Rotunda.
<pagebreak id="15" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There then you have it: I hope
you cannot complain of an heavy Building
here. I do not know any Piece of 
Stone-work in the whole Garden that shews itself
to more Advantage than this does, or makes
a more beautiful Figure in a Variety of fine
Views from several Parts of the Garden:
Several Parts of the Garden likewise return
the Compliment, by offering a great many
very elegant Prospects to it. There you
have an Opening laid out with all the
Decorations of Art; a spacious Theatre; the
Area floated by a Canal, and peopled with
Swans and Wild-ducks: Her late Majesty is
the principal Figure in the Scene, and around
her a merry Company of Nymphs and
Swains enjoying themselves in the Shade.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess I cannot very
much admire --

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come; none of your Cavils. --
Observe how this View is beautifully 
contrasted by one on the opposite Side of a
different kind; in which we are almost solely
obliged to Nature. You must know I look
upon this as a very noble Prospect! The
Field is formed by that Semi-circle of Trees
into a very grand Theatre. The Point of
Sight is centred in a beautiful manner by the
Pyramid, which appears to great Advantage
<pagebreak id="16" />
amongst those venerable Oaks: Two or
three other Buildings, half hid amongst the
Trees, come in for their Share in the
Prospect, and add much to the Beauty of it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I agree with you entirely; nor
do I think this other View inferior to it.
That Variety of different Shades amongst
the Trees; the Lake spread so elegantly
amongst them, and glittering here and there
thro' the Bushes, with the Temple of <font>Venus</font>
as a Termination to the View, make up a
very beautiful Landskip.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a Vista likewise very
happily terminated by the Canal, and the
Obelisk rising in the Midst of it. There is
another close View likewise towards 
<font>Nelson's</font> Seat.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Word, we have a
Variety of very elegant Prospects centred in
this Point. I could sit here very agreeably 
a little longer.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, if you are inclined to rest,
come along with me: I'll carry you to where
you may indulge your Humour with great
Propriety. Deep in the Retirement of that 
Wood, the God of Sleep has reared his
Habitation, where he will afford you every
<pagebreak id="17" />
Convenience to make a Nap agreeable --
It comes into my Head that I forgot to 
carry you to a little Place, which it is hardly 
worth while to travel back to from this
Distance: It is called <font>St. Austin's</font> Cave,
and answers its Title very well; it appears
quite Cell-like, stands retired, and is made
of no other Materials but Roots and Moss.
In the Inside a Straw Couch offers you an 
hard Seat, and the Walls three humorous
Inscriptions, in Monkish Verse. You may
buy them, bound up with Copies of all the
other Inscriptions, in a Six-penny Pamphlet,
that will be offered us at the Inn. --
There, Sir, is the Temple of Sleep.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why really I must confess <font>Ovid</font>
himself could scarce have buried the senseless
God in an happier Retirement. This gloomy
Darkness, these easy Couches, and that
excellent <font>Epicurean</font> Argument above the
Door, would incline me wonderfully to 
indulge a little, if these beautiful Ornaments 
did not keep my Attention awake. There
is wanting too a purling Stream, to sing a
Requiem to the Senses; tho' the Want is 
in some measure made up by the drowsy
Lullibies of that murmuring Swarm, which
this Shade has invited to wanton beneath
it. You would laugh at me, or I should
certainly throw myself down upon one of
<pagebreak id="18" />
these Couches; I am persuaded I should
need no Opium to close my Eyes.

 </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I own sleeping is a Compliment
as much due to this Place, as Admiration
and Attention are to <font>Raphael</font> at 
<font>Hampton-Court</font> . But try if your Curiosity cannot
keep you awake. Come, leave these drowsy
Abodes, they are infectious; like luscious
Food they will blunt your Appetite before
the Entertainment is half over. Walk down
that Alley, and pop your Head into the
first Door you come to.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What the D---l have we got 
here? What wretched Scrawler has been
at work upon these Walls?

    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I assure you, Sir, I look upon 
this as a very great Master-piece. You must
know this House is inhabited by a 
Necromancer; and that Inscription lets you see
the Hand that has been employed to paint it.
The Composition, Drawing, and Pencilling,
I can allow you, are not the most elegant;
yet if the Design and Figures are the Artist's
own, I can assure you he has shewn 
excellent Humour, and an exceeding good
Invention. That Consultation is well 
imagined; and so are these Witches and Wizards;
their Employments likewise, their Forms
<pagebreak id="19" />
and Attitudes are well varied. -- But 
I see this is a Scene not suited to your Taste:
Our next, I hope, will please you better.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, what Building is that
before us? I cannot say I dislike the Taste it
is designed in. It seems an Antique.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is the Temple, Sir, of
Ancient Virtue; the Place I am now
conducting you to. You will meet within it a very 
illustrious Assembly of great Men; the wisest
Lawgiver, the best Philosopher, the most
divine Poet, and the most able Captain, that
perhaps ever lived.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may possibly, Sir, engage
yourself in a Dispute, by fixing your Epithets
in such an absolute manner; there are so
many Competitors in each of these Ways, 
that altho' Numbers may be called truly
eminent, it will be a difficult matter to fix
Pre-eminence upon any.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will hardly, I fancy, dissent
from me, when I introduce you to these
great Heroes of Antiquity: There stands
<font>Lycurgus</font> ; there <font>Socrates</font> ; there <font>Homer</font> ;
and there <font>Epaminondas</font> . Illustrious Chiefs,
who made Virtue their only Pursuit, and
the Welfare of Mankind their only Study;
<pagebreak id="20" />
in whose Breasts mean Self-interest had no
Possession. To establish a well-regulated
Constitution; to dictate the soundest 
Morality, to place Virtue in the most amiable
Light; and bravely to defend a People's 
Liberty, were Ends which neither the 
Difficulty in overcoming the Prejudices, and
taming the savage Manners of a barbarous
State; the Corruptions of a licentious Age,
and the Ill-usage of an invidious City; 
neither the vast Pains of searching into Nature,
and laying up a Stock of Knowledge 
sufficient to produce the noblest Work of Art;
nor popular Tumults at Home, and the
most threatning Dangers Abroad, could
ever tempt them to lose Sight of, or in the
least abate that Ardency of Temper with
which they pursued them.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A noble Panegyric upon my
Word! why, Sir, these great Spirits have
inspired you with the very Soul of Oratory.
However, in earnest, I confess your
Encomium is pretty just; and I am apt to
believe that if any of those worthy Gentlemen
should take it into his Head to walk from 
his Nitch, it would puzzle the World to 
find his Equal to fix in his Room. --
That old Ruin, I suppose, is intended to
contrast with this new Building.
<pagebreak id="21" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, it is intended to 
contrast with it not only in the Landskip, but
likewise in its Name and Design. Walk
a little nearer, and you will see its
Intention.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can see nothing here to let 
me into its Design, except this old 
Gentleman; neither can I find any thing 
extraordinary in him, except that he has met with
a Fate that he is entirely deserving of,
which is more than falls to the Share of
every worthless Fellow.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you observed how the 
Statue is decorated?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! I see the whole Design: A
very elegant Piece of Satyr, upon my Word!
This pompous Edifice is intended, I suppose,
to represent the flourishing Condition, in
which ancient Virtue still exists; and those 
poor shattered Remains of what has never
been very beautiful (notwithstanding, I see,
they are placed within a few Yards of a 
Parish-church) are designed to let us see the
ruinous State of decayed modern Virtue.
And the Moral is, that Glory founded 
upon true Worth and Honour, will exist, when
Fame, built upon Conquest and popular
Applause, will fade away. This is really the
<pagebreak id="22" />
best thing I have seen: I am most 
prodigiously taken with it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I intend next to carry you to a
Scene of another kind. I am going to shew 
you the Grotto, a Place generally very
taking with Strangers. -- I thought that 
Piece of Satyr would catch your Attention:
I hope likewise you will be as well pleased
here. This Gate will carry us into the
romantic Retirement. What do you think
of this Scene?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why really, Sir, it is quite a
Novelty: This Profusion of Mirrors has a
very extraordinary Effect: The Place seems
divided into a thousand beautiful 
Apartments, and appears fifty times as large as 
it is. The Prospects without are likewise
transferred to the Walls within: And the
Sides of the Room are elegantly adorned
with Landskips, beyond the Pencil of <font>Titian</font> ;
with this farther Advantage, that every View,
as you change your Situation, varies itself
into another Form, and presents you with 
something new.

<pagebreak id="30" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What an happy Man you are,
thus to find an Opportunity of moralizing
upon every Occasion! What a noble View
you have displayed before me; when 
perhaps if I had been alone, I should have
entertained myself no otherwise than in
examining the Busts; or if I read the
Inscriptions, they would only have drawn a 
Remark from me, that they were well wrote. --
The Assembly yonder on the opposite Side 
of the Water, will be, I suppose, the next
Subject for your Rapsody. Pray what
Titles are those Gentry distinguished by?
At this Distance I can hardly find out whether
they are Philosophers or Milk-maids.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Sir, you have there a
View of the Kingdom of <font>Parnassus</font> : That 
Assembly is composed of <font>Apollo</font> , and his
Privy-council. But as I believe they will
hardly pay us, by any Beauty in their
Workmanship, for our Trouble, should we go
round and make them a Visit; it is my
<pagebreak id="31" />
Advice that we walk directly from hence to
the Temple of Friendship, and so return by
that Terrace back again to those Parts of
the Garden that remain yet unseen.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my Heart: But let
us turn in here, I beseech you, and walk
as much in the Shade as possible, for the
Day grows vastly warm.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am ready to follow you amongst
the Trees, not more out of Complaisance
than Inclination: I like a cool Retreat as
well as you. When I plan a Garden, I 
believe, I shall deal much in shady Walks;
wherever I open a grand Terrace, I intend
to lengthen out by its Side a close Vista:
through the one I shall lead Strangers, in
the other enjoy my Friends. I am a great
Admirer of walking in a Shade; it is a kind
of Emblem of the most agreeable Situation
in Life, the retired one: Every fantastic View
is hid from us, and we may if we please, be
Poets, or Philosophers, or what we will.
I own I admire the Taste of these buzzing
Insects, sporting themselves in the Shade; a
glaring Sun-shine neither in the World, nor
in a Walk, is agreeable to my Way of thinking.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If all the World thought as you
do, we should have neither Statesmen to
<pagebreak id="32" />
mend our Laws, nor Coblers to mend our
Shoes: We should all run and hide
ourselves amongst Trees, and what then would 
become of Society?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I thought you did not
willfully mistake my Meaning, I would take the
Trouble of telling you that I am an 
Advocate for no other <font>Retirement</font> than such as
is consistent with the Duties of Life. A
Love for which kind of Retirement, <font>properly
qualified</font> , is <font>Health</font> to the Mind; but
when it is <font>made up</font> unskillfully, it throws
us into a <font>fatal Lethargy</font> , from whence 
begins the Date of an useless Life. Every
virtuous Mind, in a greater or a less Degree,
has a turn this Way, and the <font>best</font> , I believe, 
ought to be at the <font>most</font> Pains to guard 
against carrying this Inclination into the
Extreme.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet the Annals of most
Nations let us see that their greatest Men
have often indulged it; and much for the 
Benefit of Mankind too; witness many of
the illustrious Worthies we have just been
visiting: You forget the Panegyric you
bestowed upon them.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir: But do you
remember that I placed these cool Reasoners on
<pagebreak id="33" />
the best Side of a Comparison with those who
entred into the World, and spent their Lives
in Action? On the contrary, this latter kind
of Men have always stood fairest in my
Esteem. The Life of a Recluse I would
recommend to none but a Valetudinarian. We
were intended to assist each other as much
as we are able. For my Part, it has always
been my Opinion, that <font>one good Man</font> does 
more Service in the World, than <font>a thousand 
good Books</font> . -- But we'll drop our 
Argument at present, because I see we have
finished our Walk.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that Building the Temple of
Friendship? I cannot say that I extremely 
admire it: But I hope I shall meet with more
Entertainment within, than I am able to do 
without. -- Well: This is elegant I
must confess.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, look round, and tell me if
you are not struck by several very beautiful
Objects. Those Busts I assure you are <font>all</font>
pretty well done, and <font>some</font> of them
extremely well.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So they are indeed: But I am 
chiefly intent upon the Painting, which I
am much taken with: It is by the same
Hand, I dare say, with that in the Temple
<pagebreak id="34" />
of <font>Venus</font> . That Emblem of Friendship
above the Door, those of Justice and Liberty,
and those other Ornaments upon the Walls, 
are well touched. What is that Painting
upon the Cieling? I do not rightly 
understand it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Sir, it is a Piece of
Satyr: I am sure you will like it if you will
give yourself the Trouble to examine it:
It is in your Taste I know exactly. --
There you see sits <font>Britannia</font> ; upon one
Side are held the Glory of her Annals, the
Reigns of Queen <font>Elizabeth</font> and <font>Edward</font> III.
and on the other is offered the Reign of
--, which she frowns upon, and puts
by with her Hand.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Excellent, upon my Word! 
Faith, this is good! Never accept it, honest
Lady, till Corruption is at an End, and
public Spirit revives.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With so little Malevolence as
I know you are possessed of, I do not think
I ever met with any body in my Life so
eager to catch at any thing to blame; or
to whom an Opportunity of that kind 
afforded a more seeming real Pleasure than
it does to you. -- But I know it
proceeds from an honest Nature. -- Well:
Suppose we continue our Walk. -- I look
<pagebreak id="35" />
upon that Statue as one of the finest in the
World: I would give all the Money in my
Pocket for a Sight of the Original.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Posture always to me 
appears a little too much strained. I can scarce
throw myself into such an Attitude. Yet
it is fine I must confess.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have the best View of it, 
Sir, from hence. Most of the Engravings
I have met with give us the back View, but
I think the Statue appears infinitely to the 
best Advantage when taken in Front. The
Air of the Head is delightful, and cannot
be hid without depriving the Figure of half
its Life. -- I am leading you now to that 
genteel Piece of Building which goes by 
the Name of the Palladian Bridge.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have seen, I think, something
like it at my Lord <font>Pembroke's</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe, Sir, the Model was
taken from thence. Tho' if I remember
right, the Roof is there supported by
Pillars on both Sides.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it is. -- But what have
we got there? You are taking me past
something curious. 
<pagebreak id="36" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg your Pardon: Indeed I
had almost forgot the Imperial Closet: And
I wonder I should, for I assure you I have
the greatest Veneration for its Inhabitants. --
There, Sir, is a noble Triumvirate. <font>Titus</font> ,
<font>Trajan</font> , and <font>Aurelius</font> , are Names which 
want not the Pomp of Title to add a
Lustre to them.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish you could persuade all 
the Kings in <font>Europe</font> to take them as
Patterns. But, God knows, public Spirit is 
now at a low Ebb amongst us: There is
more of it in that single honest Sentiment,
<font> <foreign>Pro me: si merear, in me</foreign> </font> , than I believe
is to be found in this degenerate Age in
half a Kingdom.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see, my good Friend, you can
moralize upon Occasion too.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Moralize! The D---l take me, 
if I would not this Moment, in spite of --

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, come, don't grow serious:
You know I have long since laid it down as
a Rule, to stop my Ears when you get into
your political Vein. I am not now to learn
that there is no keeping you within the
Bounds of Temperance upon that Topic.
<pagebreak id="37" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then, let us have 
something else to talk about. -- Yon Wall
at this Distance seems to promise us some 
Bass-relief.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir; you are there
presented with a View of the different Quarters 
of the World, bringing their various 
Products to <font>Britannia</font> . It is a pretty
Ornament enough for a Bridge, which, like the
Art of Navigation, joins one Land to 
another.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say I much admire the
Workmanship. There is a great Degree of
Aukwardness in several of the Figures.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why really I am so far of your
way of thinking, that I must own I am no
great Admirer of this kind of Work, except 
it be extremely fine. -- The best thing
in this Way, that ever I met with, is a Piece
of Alt-relief which his Lordship keeps
within Doors. We shall scarce, I believe have
time now, but we must take an 
Opportunity of seeing it before you leave the
Country. You will meet with likewise in those
Apartments several very good Pictures: I
remember spending an Afternoon about half 
a Year ago, in a very agreeable Manner
amongst them. But this Piece of Alt-relief
<pagebreak id="38" />
struck me beyond every thing. The Story
is <font>Darius's</font> Tent; and it is so charmingly 
told, that I have had, I can tell you, a 
meaner Opinion of <font>Le Brun</font> upon that
Subject, ever since I have seen it: The
Composition is so just, the Figures so
graceful and correct, nay, the very Drapery so
free and easy, that I declare I was altogether 
astonished at the Sight of it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well; I shall find some
Opportunity of paying it a Visit. There is so
much Art required, and so much Difficulty
attends doing any thing in this Way as it
ought to be, that when we do meet with a 
good Piece of Workmanship of this kind,
it affords us an extreme Pleasure. --
So, Sir <font>William</font> , have I met you here! I
should rather have expected to have seen
you among the <font>British</font> Worthies. --
This same <font>Penn</font> , Sir, I assure you, is a great
Favourite of mine. I esteem him one of 
the most worthy Legislators upon Record.
His Laws, I am told, act still with great
Force in <font>Pensylvania</font> , and keep the honest,
inoffensive People there in extreme good 
Order.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our Sailors mention his Colony 
as a very happy Set of People; they live
entirely at Peace amongst themselves; and
<pagebreak id="39" />
(bred up in a strict Observance of Probity)
without any Knowledge of an Art Military
amongst them, are able to preserve the most
sociable Terms with their Neighbours. --
These Busts seem to have escaped your
Observation.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, I am not so 
incurious as to suffer any thing that has been in
<font>Italy</font> to slip my Notice: Some of those
particularly that stand on the Side next 
<font>Rawleigh</font> , I was exceedingly taken with.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what is your Opinion of
checquered Marble's being made use of in
Busts?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Sir, I never see any of
these party-coloured Faces, but I am moved
with Indignation at the Sculptor's ridiculous
Humour. It is so absurd a Taste, that I
cannot conceive how it should ever enter
into a Workman's Head, to make every
Feature of a Man's Face of a different Colour;
and it amazes me, I assure you, that we meet
with daily so many Instances of such 
Absurdity. -- In several Parts of the
Garden, I have had various Views of that old
<font>Gothic</font> Building; we are now at last I hope
moving towards it. I am so wonderfully 
pleased with its outward Appearance, that
<pagebreak id="40" />
I shall be disappointed if I don't meet
something answerable within.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Sir, as old as it looks, I 
assure you it is not yet finished. You will meet
with nothing ornamental in the Inside; so
I would have you persuade yourself it has
already done all in its Power to entertain you.
And upon my Word I think it has done a
great deal: Without it, I am sure this Part
of the Garden would be quite naked and
lifeless; nor would any other Part appear
with so much Beauty. It puts one in Mind
of some generous Patriot in his Retirement;
his own Neighbourhood feels most the
Effects of that Bounty, which in some
measure spreads itself over a whole Country.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like this Disposition within,
I assure you, altogether as well as its Form
without. -- There are two or three 
Pieces of the best painted Glass that I have
any where met with: Those little historical
Pieces are exceedingly beautiful; and so are
those Landskips likewise. -- This Hill
I think appears rather too naked.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Throw your Eye over it then,
and tell me if you are not ravished with the
View before you. Nothing certainly in 
the kind can be more beautiful or great
<pagebreak id="41" />
than that pompous Pile rising in so 
magnificent a manner above the Wood. The
Building cannot possibly be shewn to greater
Advantage: The Appearance it <font>makes</font> 
presents you with an Idea sufficiently grand;
yet your Imagination cannot be persuaded
but that it is in fact much grander, and that
the Wood hides a great Part of what is to
be seen from your Eye. This is a most
delightful manner of pleasing: A grand Object
left to a good Imagination to improve
upon, seldom loses by its Assistance. Our
View likewise is greatly added to in point
of Beauty, by those several other smaller
Buildings which offer themselves, some
only half hid amongst the Branches, and 
others just peeping from amongst tufted
Trees, which make very beautiful little
garnished Dishes in this most elegant 
Entertainment.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As you have thus painted the
near Objects, let my Pencil, I beg, come
in for a few rough Touches in the
backgrounds: Without something of an Offskip,
your Man of Art, you know, seldom esteems
his View perfect. And in this Landskip
there are as many beautiful Objects thrown
off to a Distance as can well be imagined:
That Variety of fine Wood; that bright
Surface of Water, with the pointed Obelisk 
<pagebreak id="42" />
in the Midst of it; those two Pavilions
upon the Banks of the Canal; and the still
more distant View into the Country, are
Objects which, in my Opinion, make no
small Addition to the Beauty of your
Landskip; or, to carry on your Allusion, may
very well come in as a second Course in
your Entertainment. -- Our Attention, 
I think, in the next Place, is demanded by
this venerable Assembly. That old
Gentleman there sits with great Dignity: I like
his Attitude extremely: If I understood the 
<font>Runic</font> Character, I might have known 
probably (for this Inscription I fancy would
inform me) by what Title he is distinguished.
But the Gracefulness of his Posture discovers
him to have been nothing less than an Hero
of the first Rank. He puts me in Mind of
a <font>Roman</font> Senator, sitting in his Curule Chair 
to receive the <font>Gauls</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Sir, you have done him
great Honour I must own; but you have
not yet honoured him according to his 
Dignity: He is nothing less, Sir, I assure you,
than the Representative of a <font>Saxon</font> Deity.
You see here

   Thor <font>and</font> Woden <font>fabled Gods</font> --

with the whole System of your Ancestor's 
<pagebreak id="43" />
Theology. Walk round the Assembly, they
will smile upon a true <font>Briton</font> , and try if
you can acknowledge each by his distinct
Symbol.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess they do not to
me seem accoutered like Gods: For my 
Part, I should rather suspect them to be
Statues of Heroes and Lawgivers, 
metamorphised into Divinities by the Courtesy
of the Place: I shall not however go about
to dispute their Titles; but like my good
Ancestors before me, acquiesce piously in
what other People tell me. -- Tho' I
cannot say but that Lady there, bearing the
Sun (who represents I suppose <font>Sunday</font> ) looks
whimsical enough; and makes just such an
Appearance as I could imagine the misted 
Conception of an enthusiastic <font>Saxon</font> might
mould his Deities into. But in these other
Figures I must own I cannot see Superstition
at all characterized, which you may observe
generally forms its Objects of Worship into
the most mis-created things that can possibly
enter the Imagination of Man.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Sir, amongst the <font>Greeks</font>
and <font>Romans</font> , you may observe several very 
well-shaped Deities: The <font>Hercules</font> , the
<font>Apollo</font> , and the <font>Venus</font> , are at this Day
Standards of Beauty.
<pagebreak id="44" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; but I am apt to attribute
this rather to the Imagination of their 
Sculptors, than their Priests. To <font>shew Art</font> , 
rather than to <font>express Religion</font> , was the Point
aimed at in these enchanting Pieces of 
Workmanship. -- But when Superstition acted
without Controul; when the fantastic 
Notions of Priests were put into the Hands of
ordinary Workmen, even amongst the
polite <font>Greeks</font> and <font>Romans</font> themselves, Lord!
what misshapen Monsters crouded into
Temples, and reared themselves aloft above
Altars! Search other Countries likewise,
<font>Egypt</font> and <font>Africa, China</font> and <font>Japan</font> , or
any Place either ancient or modern, where
Superstition prevails, and I dare engage in
the whole Catalogue of their Deities you
will scarce meet with one that bears any
thing like the human Shape.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why their Demi-Gods, or 
canonized Heroes, of which all pagan Nations
had Abundance, were generally I fancy
represented in the human Form. And these
<font>Saxon</font> Divinities, I suppose, pretend not to
any superior Rank. -- But however, as no
Degree of Veneration is exacted from you,
you may I think let them rest quietly upon
their Pedestals, without any farther
Molestation. -- We have a good View into the
Country from hence. Those Woods are
<pagebreak id="45" />
extremely elegant in their kind; we must
certainly contrive to take a Ride thither
some Evening. They are laid out in a very
fine Manner, and cut into very beautiful
Ridings.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, that is the kind of
Improvement that takes most with me (let us step in
here a Moment, we are caught I see in a
Shower) I am altogether of the Poet's 
Opinion, that

   <font>'Tis</font> Use <font>alone that sanctifies Expence</font> .

Were I a Nobleman, I should endeavour to 
turn my Estate into a Garden, and make my 
Tenants my Gardiners: Instead of useless
Temples, I would build Farm-houses; and
instead of cutting out unmeaning Vistas, I
would beautify and mend Highways: The 
Country should smile upon my Labours, and
the Public should partake in my Pleasures.
What signifies all this ostentatious Work?
Is any Man the better for it? Is it not Money
most vilely squandered away?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So far from it, that I assure you,
considered even in a public Light, I look
upon it as an Expence that may very
properly be said to be sanctified by <font>Use</font> .
<pagebreak id="46" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Polypth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose you are going to tell 
me that it feeds two or three poor
Labourers; and when you have said this, I know
not what more you can say to defend it.
But how is it possible for a Man to throw
away his Money without doing some
Service in the World?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Calloph.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? Why by spending it in
gaming, to the Encouragement of Cheats
and Sharpers: By squandering it away upon
Lusts and Appetites, in the Support of Stews
and Bawdy-houses: Or by Dealing it out
in Bribes, in opposition to Honesty, and to
advance Corruption. In Arts like these,
what Numbers consume their Wealth! It is
not enough for them to prevent Mankind's 
being benefited by their affluent 
Circumstances; but they do their utmost, while they
diminish their Fortunes, to make all they
can influence as worthless as themselves.
So that I assure you I should look upon it
as a very great Point gained, if all our Men
of Fortune would only take care that their
Wealth proves of no Disservice to Mankind.
Tho' I am far from desiring they should stop 
there: I would have them endeavour to turn
it into some useful Channel. And in my
Opinion, it is laid out in a very laudable 
Manner, when it is spent, as it is here, in
circulating thro' a Variety of Trades, in
<pagebreak id="47" />
supporting a Number of poor Families, and in
the Encouragement of Art and Industry.
