</dialogue> <head>THE
ARRAIGNMENT
OF
THE EARLE OF CASTLEHAVEN.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Thomas</font> Lord Coventry, Lord Keeper of
the Great Seale of England, was for this
day Lord high Steward of England, who
brought the Commission into the Court,
and after an Oyez gave it to the Serjeant
at Armes, who gave it to Sir <font>Thomas
Fanshaw</font> to reade, who reads it, and then the 
usher of the blacke Rod kneeled downe to my Lord, and
presented him with a white rod. He had seven great Maces
carried before him when hee came into the Court: hee sate in a
chaire of State; there attended him a Harald at Armes.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>The Judges sate before the Lords on each side of the table,
whose names were,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<comment type="compiler">JUDGES' NAMES OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>After the Commission was read, and the staffe received by
the Lord high Steward, he commanded an Oyez to be made,
and after gave licence to all the Peeres of the Realme to put
on their hats, and then all the Lords were called by their names,
and answered particularly to them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then was the Lieutenant called to bring forth his prisoner,
who sate by the Common Pleas, and hee brought him to the
barre, with divers of the Guard attending upon him, where he
had a place in manner of a pew lined with geat velvet, and the
Lieutenant another adjoyning to it: and when he had done his
obeysance to the Lord Steward, and the rest of the Lords,
who also returned it to the Lord high Steward, spoke to him
to this effect.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   My Lord <font>Awdley</font> , the King hath understood both by
report, and the verdict of divers Gentlemen of quality, that you
stand impeached of divers great and haynous crimes; and to
try if they be true, he brings you here this day to triall, doing
like the Almighty King in the 18. of Genesis, that sent downe
to see whether their sinnes were so grievous as the cry of them,
and Kings on earth can have no better paterne to follow, then
the Kings of heaven: the Soveraigne, Gods Vicegerent on
earth, hath commanded that you should be tried this day: and
the desire of his Majesty is your tryall should be as equall as
<pagebreak id="3" />
equity it selfe. And because the crimes that come this
day before you, may in some breed detestation, and the
person in others compassion: first lay these two aside, and let your
reason sway your judgement, and your head your heart.
And therefore these Peeres, who are your Peeres, and who
have as noble justice in their hearts, as noble blood in their
veynes, are this day to try you; therefore if you be innocent,
speake without feare, and bee sure those that accuse you shall
not escape free. But if you be faulty, I advise you to give
honour to God and the King, and confesse your fault, for it is no
vaine confidence nor subtilty that can hide the truth; therefore
if truth touch you at the heart, and your conscience is a
thousand witnesses, and God is greater then both, stand not against
it; and if you doe not, God will put into the hearts of those
noble persons to finde it out, and doe that is just.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lord <font>Awdley</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have beene a close prisoner these
six months, without friends, and without Counsell, and am
but of a weak speech at the best, and therefore I desire to have
the liberty of having a Counsell to speake for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>My Lord high Steward said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> For your imprisonment, to
you it hath beene a speciall favour, for you have had time
enough, more then ever any man had that hath beene
committed for such offences, and more favour then ever any man that
came to this bar, and you demand nothing that the law can
allow you but you shall have it, but for your demand I must
move it to the Judges and they shall satisfie you in it, or in any
other thing you require.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he propounded it to the Judges, who answered that
in criminall causes counsell is not to be allowed, but for
matter of law hee may: Sir <font>Thomas Fanshaw</font> read the Indictment
and asked him whether he was guilty or not, Lord <font>Audley</font>
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> not guilty; </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Thomas Fanshaw</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> how wilt thou
<pagebreak id="4" />
be tried? </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Audley</font> answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> by God and my Peers: </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lord
high Steward said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> the prisoner is indicted of rape and sodomy,
by two indictments, and hath <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: htah</comment> pleaded not       
guilty, and it is my
duty to charge you to stand to the triall of it, and you are to
judge of it, as they are to be proved by evidence, and you are
to ballance it.
   This cause may cary in it, in some pity, in others detestation,
both of which ought to be put into the ballance, for a graine
on either side may sway the scale, but reason must rule your
affections, and your heads, your hearts: you are to give an
attentive eare, and then weigh equally, that the scale may leane
the right way, and the Judges will assist you in point of law,
which if you doubt, one may propound it to me, and I to them,
or of the prisoner, this your Lordships are to doe without
corporall oath: The law conceiveth you of such, that you will do
that for justice, which others doe for their oath, and therefore
admits of no challenge, God direct you to it. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Master Attorny
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my Lord high Steward, and it please your Grace, there
are two Indictments against <font>Martin</font> Lord <font>Audley</font> , the first   
for
Rape, the second for Sodomy, the prisoner is honourable, the
crimes dishonorable of which <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: whch</comment> hee is indicted   
(if it falls out to
be true) which is to be left to triall; I dare be bold to say,
never Poet invented, nor Historiographer writ of any so foule,
though <font>Suetonius</font> hath curiously set out the vices of some of
the Emperors, which had absolute power, and that might
make them fearelesse of any maner of punishment, and besides
were heathens and knew not God, yet none of them came
neere this Lords crime; this is a crime of that rarity in our
nation, that wee seldome know of the like, and the other that
we scarse heare of it, but they are of that pestilential nature that
if they be not punished they will draw from heaven heauy
judgements upon this Kingdome: I can speake with comfort
<pagebreak id="5" />
that all my time, both in his Majesties royall Fathers life, and
since he came to his Crowne, I never had occasion to speake in
this place against any Peere of the Realme before now, and
God knowes I doe it now with sorrow, and I hope I shall not
have occasion to doe so much againe; but his Majesty who is
the patterne of vertue, not onely as King, but in his person also,
in whom it is hard to judge whether hee excell most in Justice
or Mercy, but I rather thinke in Mercy, for he would have my
Lord <font>Audley</font> the prisoner at Barre heard with as much favour
as such a crime as this can bee; when he first heard it, he gave
strict accoumpt that the triall should bee searched, that his
throne and people should be cleared from so grievous sins, and
therefore he was indicted in his owne Countrey, according to
the law, by Gentlemen of worth. The Bill is found, and now
he is brought to this Barre to be tried by his honourable Peeres,
such as of whose wisedome and sincerity there can bee no
question, but to have an honourable hearing. And first, I
shall beginne with the indictment of Rape, <font>Bracton</font> tells
us of King <font>Athelstons</font> law, before the conquest; if the party
were of no chast life but a whore, yet there may bee a
ravishment, but it is a good plea to say she was his concubine; In an
indictment of Rape there is no time of prosecution necessary,
for <foreign>nullum tempus occurrit regi</foreign> , but in case of an appeale of
Rape, if the woman did not prosecute in convenient time, it
will barre her for the <foreign>crimen sodomiticum</foreign> , our law had no
knowledge of it till 15. <font>H.</font> 8. by which statute it was made      
fellony,
and in this there is no more question, but onely whether it bee
<foreign>crimen sodomiticum sine penetratione</foreign> , and the law the 5. of
<font>Elizabeth</font> , sets downe in generall words, and there the law doth
not distingish, neither must we: I know you will bee curious
how you give the least mitigation of so abhominable a sinne,
which brought such plagues after it, as we may see in Gen. 18.
<pagebreak id="6" />
Judges 14. Rom. I. But my Lords, it seemed to me strange at
the first, how a noble man of his quality should lust to such
abhominable sins, but when I found he had given himselfe
over to lust, and find that <foreign>nemo repente sit pessimus</foreign> , and that 
if
men once habit themselves in ill, it is no marvell if they fall
into any sinne, and that he was constant in no religion, but in the
morning would be a Papist, in the afternoone a Protestant; I
shall bee bold to give your Grace a reason why hee became so
ill, he beleeved not God, then what may not a man runne into?
but I find things beyond imagination, for I find his intentions
bent to have his wife naught, which the wickedest man that
ever I heard of before would have vertuous, and godly, how
bad soever himselfe be, and him lewd to his owne wife, if she
love him she must love <font>Henry Skipwith</font> , whom he loves above
all, and not in any honest love, but in a dishonest; he gives his
reason by Scripture, she was now subject to him, and therefore
if she did ill at his command it was not her fault but his, and
he would answer it; he lets this <font>Skipwith</font> who he calls his
favourite, spend of his purse 500. l'. <font>per annum</font> , and if his    
wife
or daughter would have any thing, though necessary, they
must lie with <font>Skipwith</font> and have it from him, and not otherwise;
also telling <font>Skipwith</font> and his daughter, that he had rather have
a child by him then by any body else. But this thing I had
rather should come out of the mouthes of the witnesses then
from me.

</dialogue> <head>THE SEVERALL EXAMINATIONS AND
DEPOSITIONS BEFORE THE LORDS.

WALTER BIGGES <font>EXAMINATION</font> .</head> <dialogue>

   <font>Antill</font> was a Page to Sir <font>Henry Smith</font> , and had no meanes
when he came to my Lord <font>Audley</font> : he entertained him for
a Page eight yeares, and then let him keepe horses in his
ground, by which I thinke he inriched himselfe 2000. l'. but he
never sat at the table with him till he had married his
daughter, then gave him to the value of 7000. l'. <font>Henry Skipwith</font> ,
was sent from Ireland by my Lord, to be a Page to my Lady,
his Father and Mother were very meane folkes, there he spent
out of my Lords meanes 500. l'. <font>per annum</font> , and he gave him
at one time 1000. l'. and hath made divers deeds of lands to
him: My Lord was at first a Protestant, after the buying of
Fountaine turn'd his religion.
</dialogue> <head> <font>LORD</font> AUDLEY <font>HIS EXAMINATION</font> .</head> 
   <nonSpeech>He saith <font>Henry Skipwith</font> had no meanes when hee came to

<font>Skipwith</font> did lie with him when he was straightned in roome; and
that hee gave a farme of 100. l'. to <font>Antil</font> that married his
daughter, and at other times to the valew of 7000. l'. and

bestowed an ill disease there, and therefore he sent her away.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord high <font>Steward</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I advise you not to deny those

lesse credit to the rest you say.

she loved him, shee must love <font>Antil</font> , and if shee lay with any
man with his consent, it was not her fault, but his.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Hee would make <font>Skipwith</font> come naked into her chamber,

Lord held her hands, and one of her feet, and she would have

   <nonSpeech>Hee spent five hundred pounds <font>per annum</font> of the Lords purse.
He lay for the most part in bed with the Earle: hee gave
him his house in Salisbury, and a Mannour of a hundred and
threescore pound <font>per annum</font> ; and that hee usually lay with the
young Lady, and there was love before and afterwards. And
that my Lord said hee would rather have a boy of his getting,
then of any other; and that shee was but thirteene yeares old
<pagebreak id="9" />

<font>Skipwith</font> gave her; but she would not lye with <font>Pawlet</font> : he    
solicited
also to lye with <font>Greene</font> : that hee saw <font>Skipwith</font> and shee lye
together divers times, and nine of the servants in the house had
likewise seene it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>When he solicited her she said her husband loved her not,
and that he would turne her out of doores if she did not, and if
she would not he would tell her husband she did. That he

 <head> <font>THE EARLES EXAMINATION.</font> </head> 
   <nonSpeech>Hee desired to bee pardoned in those things of which hee
must accuse himselfe, and that condemnation should not
come out of his owne mouth.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Master Attorney generall said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you have seene the cleernes
of the cause proved, and I know your wisedomes to be such as
you well know in so darke a businesse a clearer cannot be; for
let a man be never so wicked, he will not call witnesses to see it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord high Steward asked, whether may a wife be witnesse
against her husband.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Judges answer: In civill causes she cannot, in criminall shee
may, especially where she is the party grieved.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord high Steward asked whether buggery was within the
Statute, without penetration.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Judges answer: It may, the use of the body to spend seed
doth it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord high Steward asked whether one can ravish a woman
of ill fame, or no.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="11" />
   <nonSpeech>Judges answer: a whore may be ravished, and it is felony to
doe it. Lord high Steward asked whether there be a necessity
of accusation for ravishing, in convenient time.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Judges answer: in an indictment there is not, in an appeale
there is.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord high Steward asked, whether men of no worth shall
be sufficient proofe against a Baron.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Judges answer: any man in felony.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then the Lords went away to consider, and after their
returne the Lord Steward asked one by one, first of the
indictment of rape, to which they all answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Guilty; </dialogue><nonSpeech>then to the
other, and fifteene found him guilty, and the rest not.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord <font>Audley</font> spake for himselfe, that his wife had beene
naught, and had a childe, which hee concealed to save her
honour, and that his son now became 21. yeares of age, and hee
old, that the one would have lands, the other a younger
husband, and therfore they plotted his death.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then the Lieutenant was called to bring out the prisoner,
who when he was come to the Barre, the Lord high Steward
spake to him in this manner.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   <font>Mervin</font> Lord <font>Audley</font> , you have beene indicted, and have
pleaded not guilty, and put your selfe on God and your Peers,
who have found you guilty of both, and therefore my heart
grieveth that my tongue must utter, but justice is the way to
cut off wickednesse. O thinke upon your offences, which a
Christian ought scarce to name, and which the depraved
nature of man, which carries us to all vice, yet hates this
unnaturall sin; and you have not onely offended against the nature,
but the rage of a man, jealousie; and though you dye not for
it, yet you have abused your daughter, and having honour and
fortune to leave behinde, you would have had the spurious
seed of a varlet to inherit both.
<pagebreak id="12" />
   But my Lord it grieves me to see you stand against a truth
apparant and concluded upon, how God might have taken
you away in your sinnes, and therefore I hope he hath reserved
you as a subject of mercy, when you were blinded in your sins
he sends you to see this day of shame, to turne you to him; and
seeing hee doth in a manner draw you, spend the rest of your
time in teares and repentance, and this dayes worke is a
correction for many crimes corruption.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Lord high Stewards sentence of death pronounced against  
the Lord Castlehaven.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Forasmuch as thou <font>Mervin</font> Lord <font>Audley</font> hast been indicted
of divers fellonies, for which thou desiredst to be tryed by
God and thy Peeres, which tryall thou hast had, and they
have found thee guilty of them, thy sentence therefore is, that
thou returne to the place from whence thou camest, and from
thence to the place of execution, there to bee hanged by the
necke till thou be dead.
   And the Lord have mercy upon thee.
