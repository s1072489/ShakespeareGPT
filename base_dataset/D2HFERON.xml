shorte, the tagges are broken, I cannot
lace my selfe with it, take it away, I will haue

Crimson veluet with siluer fringe: why doe

giue me some cleane sockes, I will
haue no woorsted hosen, showe me
my Carnation silke stockins: where laide you

giue me my veluet pantofles;
send for the shoomaker that he may haue
againe these turn-ouer shooes, for they be too high
Put on my white pumpes: let them vp
I will none of them: Giue me rather my
Spanish leather shooes, for I will walke
<pagebreak id="E1V" />
to day, This shooing-horne hurteth me,
Can you not put them on with the furre?
Tye the strings with a strong double
knot, for feare they vntye them-selues:
Iolye, come dresse my head, set
the Table further from the fire, it is too neere.
Put my chayre in his place, Why doe you
not set my great looking glasse on the table?
It is too high, set the supporter lower,
Vndoe my night attire:
Why doe you not call the Page to warme the
rubbers? let him be called: heere sirra warme
that, and take heed you burne it not.
I praye you Iolye rubbe well my head,
for it is very full of dandrife, are not my combes
in the case? Where is my
Iuorye combe? Combe mee
with the boren combe: Giue me
first my combing cloth, otherwise
you will fill me full of haires, the haires
will fall vpon my cloathes,
Combe backe-ward, O God! you combe
too harde, you scratch me, you
pull out my hayres, can you not
vntangle them softly with your handes
before you put the combe to it? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> will
it please you to rise vp a little Madame?
For your haires are so long, that they
trayle on the ground </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My daughter
Fleurimonde is like me in that,
<pagebreak id="E2V" />
hath she not faire haires, what say you of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly Madame she hath the fayrest,
the longest flaxen-couler haires that one can see,
there needeth no curling of them, for they are
curled of themselues, In truth she
hath the fayrest head of haires that euer I sawe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like her the better for it,
it is a thing verye comely for a
woman, and as <font>Saint Paul</font> saith,
It is an Ornament vnto her, but whilst
we prattle, we forget that the
time goeth away: go too, I am combed enough.
Page, take the combe-brushes, and make cleane
my combes, take heed you doe not make them
cleane with those that I vse to my head: take a
quill to take away the filth from them, and
then put them in the case, that none be
missing: go too, make an end of dressing my head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What doth it please you to weare to day
Madame? will it please you to weare your
haires onely, or els to haue your
French whood? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> giue me
my whood, for me thinketh it is
some-what colde, and I haue a rewme which
is falne on the left side of my head,
But tarrye, what weather is it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely Madame it seemeth that this
day will be the fayrest day that hath bene this 
great while. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceiue
that you would haue me to take an
<pagebreak id="E3V" />
other attyre, and for to please you, I am
content of it, but if I be sicke thereby, I will
laye the blame on you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Noe with 
the grace of God Madame.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Set vp then my French whood and my
Border of Rubies, giue me an other
head attyre: take the key of my closet,
and goe fetch my long boxe where I set
my Iewels (for to haue them out) that I vse to

make knots? where be the laces
for to binde my haires? go too Page giue me
some water to wash, where's my muske ball?

Carkenet of precious stones: call
my Taylor to bring my gowne, not
the close one, but my open gowne of
white Sattin layd on with buttons of Pearle.
Prudence, giue me my bracelets of Aggathes
Shall I haue no vardingale? you
remember nothing, you haue a
Coneyes memorye, you lose it in running,
go too you head-braine fellowe, Page hear you?
you doe but playe the foole, doe you not see
that I want my buske? what is
become of the buske-poynt? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Iol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> what dooth it
<pagebreak id="E4V" />
please you to haue Madame, a ruffe band or a
Rebato? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me see that ruffe,
How is it that the supporter is so soyled?
I knowe not for what you are fit, that
you cannot so much as to keep my
cloathes cleane: I beleeue that the meanest
woman in this towne, hath her apparel in better
order then I haue: take it away giue me my
Rebato of cut-worke edged, is not the wyer
after the same sorte as the other?
It is great wonder if it be any thing better,
Me think it is now time that you should
knowe how to serue. Is there no small
pinnes for my Cuffes?
Looke in the pinne-cushen.
Pinne that with a blacke pinne, giue
me my girdle and see that all the
furniture be at it: looke if my Cizers,
the pincers, the pen-knife, the knife to close
Letters, with the bodkin, the ear-picker and my
Seale, be in the case: where is my pursse
to weare vpon my gowne? and see that my siluer
Comfet box be full of Comfets: haue I a cleane
handkercher? I will haue no Muffe, for it is not
colde, but shall I haue no gloues?
Bring my maske and my fanne,
Help me to put on my Chayne of pearles.

it grieueth me verye much to see you so
sluggish. I haue called you an houre

force me in the end to complaine
to my Ladye your mother: it is a thing
vndecent and vnwholsome, for young people

<pagebreak id="E7V" />
doe not tell my mother and you shall see
that heer-after we shalbe more dilligent,
not-with-standing I am readie doe you not
remember the Prouerbe which my
Brother tolde vs the other day, that to rise early
is not the best chance but to breake-fast is
the surest thing? Sister where be our workes?
I forgot my needle case, take the
silke, the bottome of threed, the cruel is not
vntwyned it is all one, let vs goe when
you please, but tary a little, I haue
not my siluer thimble, it is within my

</dialogue> <head>THE 3. DIALOGUE.</head> 

<nonSpeech> <font>The Ladye: the Daughters: the
Mistrisse</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>The Dau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Beseech you Mother pray
to God to blesse me and giue
me your blessing, if it pleaseth you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray the strong Almightie God
to increase his graces in you,
and to blesse you. I meruaile verie much that
French-men (which bring vp and teach their
Children so well) doe not make them to aske
their parentes blessing (I meane their fathers
and mothers) seeing that it is a thing that hath
<pagebreak id="E8V" />
hath bene vsed by the holy Patriarches,
<comment type="compiler">COMMENT IN MARGIN: The duety of children towards their pare~ts 
to craue their blessinges.</comment> 
And also that <font>Ecclesiasticus</font> saith, that the
blessing of the father, doth strengthen the houses
of the children, and that the mothers
cursse doth roote out the foundation thereof:
What say you to it mistresse Clemence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madame, y=e= fathers &amp; mothers in France
doe not neglect to pray to God for their
Children, and although they vse not the
outward Cerimonie, yet they doe blesse
them, and without doubt, God heareth their
Prayers, and maketh the children to prosper.
<comment type="compiler">COMMENT IN MARGIN: The duetie of parentes towards their Children.</comment> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But yet a thing is of small
value, if it be not worth the asking: 
And although it is the part of fathers &amp; mothers
(truely Christians) to haue care of
their childrens education, and to pray
zealously for them, and also to prouide them
necessary thinges for this temporall life,
(Otherwise they should be worse then
Infidels and the fowles of the ayre)
Yet it is the childrens duetye
to require it in all humblenes: but enough of
that. If French-men doe amisse therein, we
neglect (it may be) manye other
good customes w=c= <comment type="compiler">SUPERSCRIPT LETTER UNCLEAR</comment> they do obserue. Now 
Fleurimond, haue you prayed to God to day?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fleu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes forsooth mother. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is
well done, for (as <font>Monsieur de Pibrac</font> saith
in the first verse of the first of his Quadrins)
<pagebreak id="F1V" />
God first of all, then honour father and mother:
which agreeth <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: agreeeth</comment> very well with this sentence:
Set God before, then let vs care for our selues.
which is as much to say, that the first
care we ought to haue, is to
serue God, and then after to care for
transitorie thinges, but note well that which I
tell you: Go too Charlote, where is your
minde? fixe my Instruction in
your memorye. I say that so soone as one
doth awake, yea euen at the breake of day,
we must praise God, according to an other
Quadrin of that honorable and learned
personage before-named: which followeth.

   At peepe of day, rise and praise God,
Let this first worke appeere:
At night leaue worke, and praise God to,
And thus spend all the yeere.

   So that we ought to begin
and end the day, yea our yeeres, by one
same thing: that is, to serue and praise God.
When you haue some more
knowledge in the french tongue, I
will that your Master
make you to learne by heart,
<font>Mounsi. de Pibracs</font> Quadrins, for they be full
of erudition and rich sentences. I pray you
Mist. Clemence, and I doe charge you, aboue all
<pagebreak id="F2V" />
things, that you stir them to the seruice of God.
Youth is bound to haue in reuerence
their Maisters.
<comment type="compiler">COMMENT IN MARGIN: The duetie of children towards their maisters &amp;

and all those which teach them to good,
for they are to them as second fathers and
mothers: yea <font>Allexander</font> the great did preferre
his Maister <font>Aristotle</font> to his Father Phillip,
in as much that he had receiued but life
of his father, &amp; of <font>Aristotle</font> , he had the meanes

resemblance betweene the not being, &amp; the euill

no euill fame, and is not in danger
of eternall torment, but he which
hath a bad being, or is wicked, is
subiect to both: <comment type="compiler">COMMENT IN MARGIN: A Caueat for Maisters &amp;

it is a good conclusion, that it were better to be

to take such foldes as they list, so that
when they haue taken growth, it is
easier to breake them, or vnroot them altogether,
then to redresse the~: I say not this for you,

as of one which hath both sufficiencie and will,
to discharge faithfully your duetie.
<pagebreak id="F3V" />
And I hope that we shall not be found
faultie for our Iudgement
therein. Fleurimond, showe me
your worke: is this your
Cut-work? me thinketh that there is
somewhat amisse:
I espie a fault in it, the edge is reasonablie
well made: is this your net-worke? see how
she frowneth! if I begin with you I will make
you leaue that frowning: &amp; you Charlote where
is your work? are your tapistrie cushens ended?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Char.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue but one cushen to do. I lacke silke,
I know not what is become of y=e= cushen canuas
all my golde and siluer is done,
I want more blacke yarne,
I haue not enough of blewe cruell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Aske some of the Steward
or of the purs-bearer: but you mistres Clemence
buye some your selfe, for you knowe better the
price of such things then they: I pray you let the~
haue what is fit for them, to the end they
lose no time, for time lost is neuer recouered.
At what houres do your Maisters come?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Charl:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our dauncing Maister
commeth about nine a clocke:
our singing Master, and he that teacheth
vs to play on the virginalles, at tenne:
he that teacheth vs on the Lute
and the Violl de Gambo, at foure a clocke

<pagebreak id="F4V" />
commeth commonly betweene seauen and eight
a clocke in the morning. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is then

You haue no cause to reprooue them

to neglect prayse where it is due
(seeing it is to a good spirit, a sting
to pricke him forward to doe good)
as shame to praise where praise is not deserued,
They take as much paine as any
other Gentlewomen that I know, and therfore
I assure you (and beseech you to beleeue me,

that there wanteth no diligence in them.

Champ-porte-aduis, I come to visit you this
Morning, and am very glad to finde your
Schollers so well employed as to their
Bookes, as I perceiue you doe not keep them
idle, wherefore I like you the better,
For there is nothing more hurtfull, not
onely to youth, but also to all
sortes of persons, then idlenes, for it
is the inuenter and mother of all euils.
You knowe wherefore they are put to
your charge, which is, not onely to
teach them in the Grammer &amp; the Latin tongue,
but also to bring them vp in good
maners, and to aduise them of their
duties, and therefore I dout not
but that the first thing you make them
to do, is to pray to God: come hether Guy, haue
you said your prayers this morning? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Guy,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes 
Mother. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you also Rene?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rene`,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Mother, so soone as we
are risen and haue put on our cloathes, and that
we haue washed, our Master maketh vs
to say prayers, and to read a Chapter in the
Bible, to repeat some Sentences out of
Cicero or some other good Author,
Then we goe to breake-fast, hauing broken fast
we studie our lessons, as you haue

Mother, I am at the end of the Chapter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You haue read, but it is not
enough to read. They that be wise, doe read for
their Instruction, &amp; not for the sound of wordes
onely, you are passed your A, B, C.
that one giueth to little Children for
to learne to pronounce and sound the wordes,
You must be better then Parrots,
which doe pronounce some wordes as well as
we doe, and yet are neuer the wiser
for want of intellgence: Haue you remembred
and do you vnderstand y=t= <comment type="compiler">SUPERSCRIPT LETTER UNCLEAR</comment> which you  
haue read?
Otherwise you are no better then a
Parrot. I remember I haue heard your
Master tell you once, this Latin Sentence:
<font> <foreign>Legere et non intelligere negligere est</foreign> </font> .
Which is as much to say (as I take it)
To read and not vnderstand, is an
vnprofitable thing: therefore haue regarde when you
read, to conceiue your reading,
to make profit by it, otherwise you read in vaine
and doe nothing but lose time. <comment type="compiler">COMMENT IN MARGIN: The duetie of

Truely I will teach you how to lye, or rather
how you should not lye.
I will not leaue such a vice vnpunished.
M. Cha~-port-aduis, I wil haue him to be whipt
soundly before his Masters,
And (as it is said) to beat the dog before the lyon
for an example vnto them.
There is nothing more bace
then lying, and euery one that is wise 
will abhorre it. It is written in the Prouerbes
of Salomo~, that the righteous man hateth lyes.
The Sonne of Sirach saith also
in these wordes, Vse not any lying at
all, for the vse thereof commeth neuer to good.
<comment type="compiler">COMMENT IN MARGIN: <font>Prouerbes</font> chapter 13. verse 5</comment>
He which will be beleeued, ought
neuer to lye, for a lyer is neuer beleeued,
Yea, if it happen that sometimes he saith true,
it shall be taken still for a lye.
It behoueth then that euery one
which will get a good reputation
shun this vice as it were a mad dogge,
For whosoeuer is once bitten with it, findeth
it incurable. But I heare some body knocke
