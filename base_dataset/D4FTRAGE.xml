<comment type="compiler">MONTANO'S SPEECH: HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH BRACILLA WHEN SHE IS ACTING
IN A PLAY. THE COUNT AND MONTANO DRINK HEAVILY AFTERWARDS BUT MONTANO
GOES BACK TO THE THEATRE THE NEXT NIGHT WHERE BRACILLA PLAYS THE PART
OF A YOUNG LOVER -- HIS SPEECH CONTINUES:</comment>
<pagebreak id="13" />
   Being behind the Scenes, the first
opportunity I had -- Madam ( <font>said I</font> )
you act the Lover to a Miracle, and it
became you so wonderfully, that I vow
'tis a thousand pities but you shou'd
be one in reality. I'm not at all oblig'd
to you, Sir, ( <font>reply'd she</font> ) for your wish,
in such an inconstant Interess'd Age
as this is, since it must only contribute
to my certain ruine. Why, Madam,
( <font>said I</font> ) did you never Love? What
makes you ask that familiar question
( <font>return'd she something angry, and leaving
me, pursu'd</font> ) whether I have or no, I shall
never Love you I'm sure. The
Heavens forbid ( <font>reply'd I, and follow'd her</font> )
But pardon me, Madam, I design'd not
to affront you by that demand, because
I thought it impossible so much of it
shou'd appear in your bare
personating a Lover, with an absolute
insensibility within, and that you shou'd be
so every way compleated for Love, and
yet be without that Blessing of Humane
Life. Sir, ( <font>said she</font> ) if you think this
Discourse pleases me, I shall leave you
to convince you that it does not.
Not so, I beseech you, Madam,
<pagebreak id="14" />
( <font>answer'd I</font> ) rather than lose the
Happiness of your Conversation, I'll curb
my forward Heart, that is unwilling
to let me talk of any thing but its
wounds. Alas! poor Gentleman
( <font>replyes she, and smil'd</font> ) then you are in
Love it seems, and out of pure spite
to those that are not so, you endeavour
to spread the infection you have caught,
or like some troublesome People at a
Feast, will needs thrust the Dish you
esteem upon every one, never
considering that another may hate it. Nay,
you Lovers, are still as impertinent,
as they, for neither of you will take
any denyal, which methinks is
something troublesome, as well as uncivil.
But pray, Sir, ( <font>pursu'd she, without
giving me any time to answer</font> ) what Fair
Lady has undone you? None of us I
dare swear, for then you wou'd not
lose your time with me, which you
might employ to bend her stubborn
Heart. But perhaps, you are a happy
Lover, and so can borrow some time
from your Mistress, to make
Proselytes. If so, ( <font>concluded she</font> ) 'tis pity
you shou'd fling it away, and a
thousand fine sayings to boot on me, since I
vow, Sir, I'm as deaf to that, as the
People to Virtue in distress.
<pagebreak id="15" />
   She staid not to hear me, but ran
to t'other side of the Stage, and before
I cou'd overtake her, was Enter'd. I
was extreamly pleas'd with her
Discourse, and was impatient till the end
of the Act, that I might attack her
once more, if it were only to have
the satisfaction of talking to her.
   But, Madam, ( <font>said I</font> ) but are you
indeed so very irreconcilable an Enemy
to Love? Why, Sir, ( <font>reply'd she</font> )
shou'd you doubt it? Do you expect to
find that on the Stage? We represent
too many of its follies to be guilty of
them our selves. You shou'd go to
some Country Village, where perhaps
you may find some believing
Romantick Virgin, that may gratifie your
Curiosity, but you are much mistaken
if you think it the growth of the
Theatre -- Gad the Girl spoke a
profound Truth </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>interrupted</font> Gerardo) </nonSpeech><dialogue> in
that, for the Devil a bit of Love did I
ever know there out of their parts,
unless when Money made 'em Act that
in their own Persons, which they did
for the same represent in anothers. But
pray proceed --
   Ah, Madam, ( <font>said I</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>continu'd</font>
Montano) </nonSpeech><dialogue> banish not the Thoughts of
<pagebreak id="16" />
Love from any place where you abide,
for there must still be <font>Lovers</font> . Besides,
'tis ingrateful to the little God to
flight him, who was the cause of your
Being. For my part ( <font>continu'd I</font> )
I shall cherish it, since my self, and
all the rest of Mankind, as well as
you, owe our Life and Being to it. I 
shall never grant that, ( <font>return'd she</font> )
unless you can prove, that ev'ry Man and
Wife Love one another. Doubtless,
Madam, ( <font>answer'd I</font> ) the most
disagreeing Couple have their intervals of
Dearness. Dearness, ( <font>said she</font> )
Madness you mean -- but for Heaven's
sake, Sir, no more of this Discourse,
since 'tis very much my aversion. Ah,
Madam, ( <font>reply'd I</font> ) what can be more
proper to talk of to the most Charming
of her Sex, than of Love. Love
( <font>answer'd she</font> ) ought not to be mention'd in
sober Company, the very symptoms of
it confess the Fool, and Mad-man, a
thousand antick postures, extravagant
sayings, and wishes, as well as
preposterous ways, to gain what it
pretends to, therefore no more of Love,
as you value your Reputation. <omission type="line" />

<comment type="compiler">MONTANO ASKS FOR ADVICE REGARDING HIS LOVE PROBLEMS.</comment>
   First, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Gerardo</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Gad I'm
extreamly sorry that in your first
Amour you shou'd not only meet with
so many Obstacles, but should take such
ill Methods in the Prosecution of it;
for the Conduct of your Passion shews
that you took wrong measures all along.
   'Tis you therefore, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the Count</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
that must put him in the right path,
from which his unexperienc'd Youth
has made him deviate.
   That shall be my task, my Lord,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd</font> Gerardo) </nonSpeech><dialogue> tho' 'tis now a more
desperate case, than if right measures
had been taken at first. Alas,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>interrupted</font> Montano) </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope what's past, has
not render'd the Disease incurable?
<pagebreak id="34" />
No, no, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd</font> Gerardo) </nonSpeech><dialogue> have a
little Courage, the Fair as well as Towns
are won, by assurance and constancy.
I wou'd therefore desire both you and
my Lord, to lay aside all this great
trouble that possesses you.
   As for me, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the</font> Count) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the
only care and trouble that affects me
in this Affair, is the grief of my
Friend, who was continually possess'd
with all the Ravings of a Man, that
wholly gave up himself to Love. He's
deaf to all that I can urge, and Reason;
brings him no relief. Ah, my Lord,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd</font> Montano) </nonSpeech><dialogue> he that pretends to
be a Lover, and at the same time to be
govern'd by Reason, is but a Hypocrite.
   Why is Love then </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said the</font> Count) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
so irreconcilable an Enemy to Reason,
that it can never cohabit with it?
Oh! without doubt </dialogue><nonSpeech> (reply'd <font>Gerardo</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue>
they are at mortal odds, for Reason
in all things prefers a <font>medium</font> as the
surest basis of all <font>Certainty</font> and <font>Good</font> , but
a <font>mean</font> in <font>Love</font> is as odious as in
Poetry. Right, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (assum'd <font>Montano</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for
'tis but indifference disguis'd in
another word, and what is so
contradictory in Nature, as an <font>unconcern'd</font> and
<font>indifferent</font> Lover? True, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>pursu'd</font>
<pagebreak id="35" />
Gerardo) </nonSpeech><dialogue> for indifference banishes
Desire, and he that's once free from 
Desire, is no longer in the number of the
<font>Loving</font> ; for <font>Love</font> , is nothing but an
unsatisfi'd desir'd Union, and
becoming, as much as Nature will allow,
one with the Object we admire. I
find, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd</font> Montano <font>with some
satisfaction</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that you <font>Gerardo</font> have known
what Love is, since you give so very
good an account of its Nature, for
tho' we cannot all be like <font>Salmacs</font>
transform'd, or as I may better say,
swallow'd up into the very same Being with
our Mistress, yet certainly no Lover, if
he Lov'd as I do, but wou'd desire a
perpetual Union, and ne'er be parted
from, but eternally be cleaving to the
fair <font>one he adores</font> . --
   But if you once grant </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>interrupted the</font>
Count) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that <font>Love</font> is so very great a
Foe to <font>Reason</font> , you must give one leave
to infer, that the first can't be
admitted without the abdication of the
latter, and if so, (abstracting from the
case of my Friend) all the pity he
deserves, that gives himself up to that
Passion, is a Slabb'ring Bib, or <font>Bedlam</font> ,
since he must be either a Fool, or a
Madman, or a perfect <font>Brute</font> , Reason
<pagebreak id="36" />
being the only distinction betwixt Man
and Beast; for I can't think, either the
substance and form of Humane Kind,
essentially different from that of Brutes.
My Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font> Gerardo) </nonSpeech><dialogue> you speak
as if <font>Love</font> were a voluntary Passion,
which we might either admit, or avoid
as we please, and if so, certainly what
you observ'd wou'd hold good, but it
being wholly involuntary, and a Power that
we can't resist, I presume the unhappy
Patient, merits as much pity, as those,
whom Fortune or Distempers renders
miserable. Be that as 'twill </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>answer'd
the</font> Count) </nonSpeech><dialogue> if indifference be a fault
in <font>Love</font> , I'm sure all beyond
moderation is distraction, and which, I thank
my Stars, I never yet was subject to.
Your Lordship, </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>reply'd</font> Gerardo) </nonSpeech><dialogue> is too
wise for your Age, for whatever the
fancy'd Happiness of extravagant <font>Love</font>
may be to such Lovers, I'm perswaded
the moderate Lover meets with as
much in reality upon Tryal. And for
my part, I can say this for my self,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>continu'd he</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that my Passion never rose
above an <font>Amouret</font> in my Life.

you are mistaken in her, she's

which is at least the thirtieth Year
of my Profession.

in the <font>Indies</font> , we have some of our
Sex ripe before that age, at least in
mind, if not in body. I have known
some have Children before they
reach'd the teens, and not one in
a thousand keeps her Maidenhead
to a dozen Years of age, if
handsome. Why I my self, my Lord,
can't remember that ever I was a 
Maid, for from an Infant I dally'd
with my equals, and so proceeded
till I came to be Mans meat, else I

some Pleasure in that Discovery, his

contriv'd by the very Husband of her

O fie, Niece</font> (replyed I) <font>you must not
