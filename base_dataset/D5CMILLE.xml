<nonSpeech>SCENE, <font>Sir</font> Credulous Hippish's <font>House</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> Credulous <font>in his Easy-Chair</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>

Mercy on us! why does not this Mr. 
<font>Galleypot</font> come? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looking on his Watch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh 
shameful! Here's a whole Morning has been thrown away,
without so much as taking one single Medicine. --    
These Apothecaries are bewitch'd sure! 'Tis a 
horrible thing a poor Creature must be left to die for want
of a Bolus. -- Oh here. -- No, 'tis my Wife. --   
I thought, my Love, you had been gone into the
City.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lady</font> Hippish.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was prevented, my Life, by an 
Accident, I thought it my Duty to inform you of 
before I went. As I pass'd by <font>Belina's</font> Chamber, just
now, I saw a young Fellow in earnest Conference
with her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How! a young Fellow with my 
Daughter!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. The Regard I have for you and
your Family, my Dear, made me endeavour to learn
what they were talking of, but I could hear nothing
to the purpose -- only a few luscious Expressions, 
and a Contrivance how to cheat the old Gentleman,
as they call'd him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Luscious <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Lusciou</comment>             
Expressions, d'ye say? -- The
old Gentleman! What old Gentleman? -- Who?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't guess, Child: Not you, to be
sure, my Dear -- one should think not. But your
<pagebreak id="53" />
little Daughter, <font>Agnes</font> , was with 'em, and can tell
you all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Send her to me here, my Love; send her
to me here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will. -- Good by t'ye, my Love, for
a little while; I'll see thee again as soon as possible.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Goodby to thee, my Life. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Lady</font>
Hippish.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, that impudent Minx, <font>Belina!</font> I don't
wonder now at her Obstinacy.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Agnes.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What would you have, Papa? My Mama
told me that you wanted to speak with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, come here -- nearer -- turn this
way -- look up -- look upon me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Papa.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What so, Papa?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you nothing to tell me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. I'll tell you the story of the <font>Ass's
Skin</font> , or the Fable of the <font>Crow and the Fox</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's not what I ask you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! you cunning Gipsy -- you know
well enough what I mean.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, Papa, but I don't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this the way of doing what you was bid?
Did not I order you to come and tell me immediately
every thing that you saw?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Papa.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And have you done so, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am come to tell you every thing I
have seen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well; and what have you seen 
to-day then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing, Papa.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing at all.
<pagebreak id="54" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! I shall make you see something 
presently. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shaking his Cane.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O dear, Papa!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You little Counterfeit, you did not tell
me you saw a Man in your Sister's Chamber.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, my Sister forbad me, Papa; but I'll
tell you every thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Take care you tell me the Truth then;
for here's my little Finger that knows all, will tell me
if you lye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, pray, Papa, don't let my Sister know
that I told you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then, Papa, there came a Man into
my Sister's Chamber as I was there; I ask'd him
what he wanted; and he told me that he was her
Musick-Master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oho! the Matter's out now. This is the
Opera-monger, with his Shepherd and Shepherdess!
-- Well, and what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Sister came in after, and cry'd, Be gone,
be gone; for Heaven's sake, be gone; I'm in Pain
for you; and we shall certainly be catch'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, he would not be gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say to her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said I don't know how many things to
her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said This, and That, and T'other; that
he lov'd her mightily; and that she was the prettiest
Creature in the World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, and then he fell upon his Knees to
her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, and then he kiss'd her Hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, and then he swore to be true to her,
and she swore to be true to him.
<pagebreak id="55" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, and then they quarrell'd a little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Quarrell'd, did you say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Papa.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, I like that. And what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then they grew more loving than ever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How! and what then, Hussy? and what
then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, and then -- they parted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And this is all?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, indeed, and indeed, Papa.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but my little Finger mutters as if
there was something else. -- Hold, ay, ay, so, so;
ay, my little Finger tells me that you've seen 
something you've not yet told me of.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Putting his Finger to his Ear.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, Papa, your little Finger is a 
Storyteller.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have a care what you say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray don't believe it, Papa, for it tells Fibs,
upon my Word.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, very well, we shall find that.
-- Get you gone, and be sure you take notice of
every thing you see.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Agnes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes, Papa, I'll be sure to mind what
you say. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Agnes.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lack-a-day! how do these Businesses 
distract me! I have not so much as Leisure to mind my
Indisposition. In truth, this is insupportable.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sitting down in his Chair.</font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Heartly.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brother, how is it? How d'ye do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very ill, Brother, very ill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very ill!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I'm so very faint, you'd hardly
think it; I have not Strength so much as to speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good lack! that's hard indeed. -- I am
come hither, Brother, to propose a Match for my
Niece <font>Belina</font> .
<pagebreak id="56" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Rising out of his Chair in a Passion.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Brother, don't speak to me of that Baggage; she's a base
impertinent, saucy Quean, and I'll make her know
that I am her Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, so, this is mighty well; I'm glad to find
your Strength return a little, and that my Visit has
done you so much good. But now, Brother, I 
desire you'd inform me, for what Reason you would
force your Daughter upon this Match, which she's so 
averse to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what Reason, Brother, am I 
Master of my own Family, but to do what I please
in't?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lady, I suppose, does not fail advising
you to get rid of your Children at any rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, there's the Thing. -- My Lady, poor
Woman, is sure to be brought on the Stage; 'tis she
that does all the Mischief, for certain; and all the
World will have it so, I suppose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, Brother, we'll leave her out of the 
Question then. She's a good Woman, that has the
best Intentions in the World for your Family; is free
from all manner of Self-Interest; has a marvellous
Tenderness for you; and shews an inconceivable 
Affection to your Children, that's certain. -- We'll say
no more therefore of her, but return to your 
Daughter. With what View would you marry her to this
Nephew of Dr. <font>Mummy's</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With a View of having so skilful a 
Physician as Dr. <font>Mummy</font> , related to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it possible you should always be so 
bewitch'd with your Doctors and Apothecaries, and
resolve to be sick, in spite of the World, and Nature
it self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d'ye mean by that, Brother? I have
been under the Doctor's Hands here, and taking 
Physick, for these Twenty Years, and yet I'm not sick,
I warrant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I mean, Brother, that 'tis a plain Sign
you have a strong Constitution, when, with all the
<pagebreak id="57" />
Physick you have taken, you've not been able to 
destroy it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But do you know, Brother, 'tis that
keeps me alive? Dr. <font>Mummy</font> has assur'd me that I
should absolutely go off, if I were but three Days from
under his Hands; but this Dr. <font>Mummy</font> knows nothing, 
I suppose, in your Opinion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! yes, he can talk good <font>Latin</font> ; call all
Distempers by their Names, in <font>Greek</font> ; knows how to
define 'em and distinguish 'em. -- But how to cure
'em, is what he doesn't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, Sir, with Submission; there are
People as wise and clear-sighted as your Worship, 
that in case of Sickness have Recourse to him for
Cure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There are a great many Trades, you know, 
that take Advantage of the Frailty of Mankind, and
get their Bread from the lucky Prepossession of 
Error. And as the greatest Weakness Men have, is the
Fear of Death, upon That the Quack builds his 
Fortune and Reputation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, but Dr. <font>Mummy's</font> no Quack;
he's a regular Physician, and one that has not the least
Artifice or Craft, but deals sincerely and 
conscientiously by his Patients.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right; so far from meaning ill in what he
prescribes, that he dispatches you out of pure 
Principle; and does no more in killing you, than what he
has done by his Wife and Children, and what upon
occasion he would do by himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, Brother, say no more against
Dr. <font>Mummy</font> , I intreat you, for it raises my Choler,
and will bring my Distemper upon me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I've done, Brother; and to change the 
Discourse, I must tell you; that you ought not to take
such a barbarous Resolution with regard to your
Daughter.
<pagebreak id="58" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Galleypot, <font>with a Bolus and Draught in 
his Hand</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, Brother, a little, with your Leave.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What are you going to do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To take this Bolus and Draught from
Mr. <font>Galleypot</font> , I shall have done it presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You jest, sure! Can't you be one Moment
without swallowing some Drug or other? Put it off
till another time, and let Nature have a little Respite
now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then, to-night, Mr. <font>Galleypot</font> , or
tomorrow Morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Galley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Business have you, Sir, to oppose the
Prescriptions of the Faculty? The Physick is 
prepar'd, and won't keep, Sir. -- And since you hinder
his Worship from taking my Bolus, I'll come upon
you, and you shall take it for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be gone, Sir. -- You are not us'd, I see,
to talk to People's Faces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Galley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Medicines are not to be jested with, Sir,
nor my Time to be lost. I came here by Dr. 
<font>Mummy's</font> Order, and shall acquaint him how I have been
hinder'd in the Performance of my Function.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Galleypot.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brother, you'll be the Cause here of some
Mischief.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A great Mischief indeed! spoiling a Bolus of
Dr. <font>Mummy's</font> Prescription. -- Once more, 
Brother, Is it impossible to cure you of the Doctor, for
that's your Disease, and nothing else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brother, you'll make me mad. -- I wish
you had my Distemper, and then we should see if you
would rattle at this rate. -- Hah! here comes
Dr. <font>Mummy</font> , and Fury in his Face too; Heaven 
preserve us!
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Mummy <font>and</font> Primrose.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very fine! this. -- I have heard a very
<pagebreak id="59" />
pleasant Story from Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> here; my 
Prescriptions contemn'd, and my Medicines rejected.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, Sir, it was not --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, 'tis a very great Insolence, a rank 
Rebellion in a Patient against his Physician.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Horrible!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Bolus that I took the pains to make up
my self!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas not me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Invented and compos'd according to the
nicest Rules of Art!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Monstrous!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And which was to have wrought Miracles
upon the Animal Spirits!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas my Brother -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To send it back contumaciously.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas he -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis an enormous Insult on the Faculty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was the Cause -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such a Crime against the Profession as can
never be enough punished.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right, Doctor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I therefore declare, that from this time
forth I break off all Correspondence with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas my Brother --  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll have no Alliance with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'll serve him right, there, Doctor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And to prevent any Relation between us,
I thus destroy the Deed of Gift I made to my 
Nephew in favour of the Marriage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad o'that; let him take it for his
pains.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis my Brother has been the Occasion of
all this Mischief; let it be brought again, and, to make
you amends, I'll take double the Quantity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should have set you to rights in a very
little time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He does not deserve it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wanted but a Score or two of Medicines
more, to have done your Business effectually.
<pagebreak id="60" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's unworthy of your Care. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, since you refuse to be cur'd by my
Hands --  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! Brother, Brother!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since you have withdrawn from me the
Obedience a Patient owes his Physician --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That cries for Vengeance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And have declar'd your self rebellious to
my Regimen and Prescriptions --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all, not at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I abandon you to your evil Constitution,
to the Acidity of your Stomach, the Alkalescency of
your Blood, the Acrimony of your Bile, and the 
Feculency of your I'll-humours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well said!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And my Will is, That within these four
Days you enter on an absolutely incurable State.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, Mercy! Mercy!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you fall immediately into a 
<font> <foreign>Dispepsia</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Doctor!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From a <font> <foreign>Dispepsia</foreign> </font> into an               
<font> <foreign>Apepsia</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doctor!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From an <font> <foreign>Apepsia</foreign> </font> , into a               
<font> <foreign>Lienteria</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dr. <font>Mummy</font> !
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From a <font> <foreign>Lienteria</foreign> </font> , into a               
<font> <foreign>Dysenteria</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Spare me, good Doctor!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mummy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And from a <font> <foreign>Dysenteria</foreign> </font> , into a         
<font>Privation of
Life</font> , the Condition your Folly has brought you 
into. -- And so, Good by t'ye, Good by t'ye.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Mummy.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Heavens! I'm dead. -- Brother, you
have been the Ruin of me; I feel the Faculty taking
Vengeance of me already.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In good troth, Brother, you are out of your
Senses, and I would not for any thing you should be
seen in these Fits. Pr'ythee feel your own Pulse a 
little, and don't give up your self to such wild 
Chimeras. Here's a lucky Opportunity now, of getting rid
of your Doctors; or, if you are born to be a Slave
<pagebreak id="61" />
to 'em, you may easily procure another, with whom
you'll run less Hazard than with this.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Primrose.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Joy, Joy, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rejoice, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rejoice, I say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, you impertinent Hussy, won't you
tell me for what, first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; I'll have you rejoice beforehand; sing
and dance. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there ever such a Slut?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are cur'd, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cur'd!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, there's a Doctor come to see you, that
will cure you of all your Distempers at once.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heaven forbid! -- Pr'ythee who is it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know him; but He and I are as like
one another, as two Drops of Water, all but his
Beard; and if I were not sure that my Mother was an
honest Woman, I should swear she had play'd the
Wag before she married my Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Desire him to walk up. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Primrose.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This happens to your Wish -- one Doctor
leaves you, and another immediately comes in his 
room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but Doctor <font>Mummy</font> was perfectly
well acquainted with my Constitution, and knew the
way to deal with me exactly. -- Oh! Oh! I feel at
Heart all those -- I don't know what to call 'em -- 
those strange Distempers he threaten'd me with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One would think Dr. <font>Mummy</font> held in his
Hands the Thread of your Life, and by a supreme
Authority, could shorten or prolong it as he thought
proper: Reflect a little, that the Principles of your
Life are in your self, and that Dr. <font>Mummy's</font> Anger is
as incapable of killing you, as his Medicines are of
keeping you alive.
<pagebreak id="62" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh lack! Oh lack! And pray, wise Sir,
what would you, out of your profound Knowledge
and Skill, advise one to do when one happens to be
sick, then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nothing, but keep your self quiet. 
Nature herself, if we'd let her alone, would gradually
throw off the Load she labours with. 'Tis our own
Impatience spoils all; for when we have but just
Strength enough to struggle with our Distemper, we
must take Loads of Drugs to burden us the more. 
Believe me, Brother, it must be a wonderful robust 
Constitution that is able to bear both the Physick and the
Disease.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mighty well, Sir, with your Nature and
you. -- But is not this Nature to be assisted by Art,
Pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lud! Lud! Brother, how you are impos'd
on! When a Physician talks to you of assisting, 
relieving, and supporting Nature; when he talks of
sweetning the Blood, strengthning the Nerves, and
restoring the Lungs, 'tis nothing but a specious way
of prating, which gives you Words instead of 
Reasons, and Promises instead of Effects: For when you
come to make Trial, you find it a mere Dream, which
leaves nothing but the Regret of having ever thought
it real.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Primrose, <font>dress'd as a Physician</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, your Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Servant, Sir. -- By my Troth,
<font>Primrose</font> herself!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are very like one another, indeed; but
'tis n't the first time we've seen such sort of things.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope, Sir, you'll pardon my Curiosity in
visiting a Person of so famous an Indisposition as your
self, and offering you my small Services in relation to
what Bleedings and Purgations you may have 
occasion for.
<pagebreak id="63" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, your Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I observe, Sir, that you look very earnestly
at me, pray how old d'ye think I may be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Old! why Thirty, belike.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha! why, I'm above Fourscore,
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fourscore!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; you see an Effect of the Secrets of
my Art, that preserve me thus lively and vigorous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I profess, a jolly Youth, for one 
o'Fourscore, if he could have but hinder'd the Growth of
his Beard, Brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! by no means; a Physician's Skill lies
chiefly in his Chin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am, Sir, an Itinerant Physician, who 
travel from Town to Town, from Kingdom to 
Kingdom, to find out Patients worthy of my Practice, and
fit to exercise the great and noble Secrets of my Art
upon. I scorn to amuse my self with the little Fry of
common Distempers, the Trifles of Rheumatisms,
Scurvies, Vapours, and Megrims. Give me your
Diseases of Importance, good Purple-Fevers, good
Plagues, good confirm'd Dropsies, good Pleurisies,
with Inflammation of the Lungs. These are what
please me; these are what I triumph over; and I wish
with all my Heart, Sir, that you had a Complication
of 'em all upon you at once; that you were given 
over by all the Physicians, and at the very Point of
Death, that I might demonstrate to you the 
Excellency of my Medicines, and the Desire I have to do
you Service.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am very much obliged to you, Sir, for
your kind Wishes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me feel your Pulse. -- Come, beat
as you should do. -- Hey! this Pulse plays the Fool. 
-- Ye don't know me yet, I find. -- Who is your 
Physician?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dr. <font>Mummy</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dr. <font>Mummy</font> ! Who is he? I have not his
<pagebreak id="64" /> 
Name in my List of eminent Physicians. Where does
he say your Distemper lies?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He says in the Spleen; others in the 
Liver.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They are all of 'em <font> <foreign>Ignoramus's</foreign> </font> ; I     
say, that
it lies in your Lungs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In my Lungs!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; where's your Pain?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have every now and then a Pain in my
Head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lungs exactly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes a Mist before my Eyes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lungs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes a violent Palpitation of the
Heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lungs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At other times I am taken with a violent
Pain in my Belly, as if it was the Colick.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lungs again. You have a good 
Appetite to what you eat?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lungs. You love to drink a Glass of
Wine?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's the Lungs. You take a comfortable 
Nap after Dinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lungs, the Lungs, I tell ye. What 
does your Physician order you to eat?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He orders me Broth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ignorant!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Chicken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ignorant!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> New-laid Eggs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ignorant!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And above all, to drink a good deal of
Water in my Wine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Ignorantus, Ignoranta, Ignorantum</foreign> !</font> -- You
must drink good, unmix'd, <font>Spanish</font> Wine, to thicken
<pagebreak id="65" />
your Blood, which is too thin. -- You must eat
good fat Beef, good fat Bacon, good <font>Dutch</font> Cheese,
Rice-Gruel, and Craw-fish Soup, to corroberate and
conglutinate. -- Your Dr. <font>Mummy</font> is an Ass, and
knows nothing of his Business; I'll send you a 
Physician of my own bringing up, and will visit you
sometimes my self, whilst I stay in the Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you'll oblige me extremely.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What the Duce d'ye do with this Arm?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do with it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cut me off this Arm immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you see that it draws all the 
Nourishment to it self, and hinders the other from 
thriving?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but I've occasion for my Arm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's an Eye too, which I'd have instantly
pluck'd out, were I in your Place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pluck out my Eye!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you perceive it injures the other, and
occasions those Mists you complain'd of but now?
Be guided by me, and have it taken away directly;
you'll see the better with your Left.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's no haste for that, Sir; 'tis as well
let alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But hark'e Sir, is there not a certain 
Gentleman, one Squire <font>Looby</font> , that is to marry your
Daughter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, he is just arriv'd from <font>Cornwal</font>
for that Purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same. -- 'Twas there he was 
constituted and inducted my Patient, but feloniously 
withdrew himself from the Remedies I had prepar'd for
him. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, ay, Doctor, your Physick is Money
at any time; so that he has actually stole your Cash.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pardon me; I don't intend to lose him so
neither; he's tied and bound my Patient, and I'll have
him seiz'd wherever I find him, and either cure him, 
or be the Death of him.
<pagebreak id="66" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has he any Distemper on him, then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Distemper, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter: Physicians are oblig'd to 
Secrecy. 'Tis enough that I injoin you not to celebrate
the Nuptials, without my Consent, under pain of 
incurring the Resentment of the Faculty, and bringing
the worst of Maladies into your Family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, if it be so with him, I shall be in 
no Hurry for the Match.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be sure you don't. -- He may run away
as much as he pleases; but I'll get a Decree against
him, and force him to be cur'd; yes, tho' there were
a Complication of Distempers, thirteen to the 
Dozen: His Body is mortgag'd to my Conduct; and it
shall never be said, that a Patient got the better of 
his Doctor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have my Consent, Sir, to physick
him your Belly-full.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Farewel, Sir. I am sorry I must leave you 
so soon, but I'm oblig'd to be at a great Consultation
to-day, upon a Person that dy'd Yesterday.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Person that dy'd Yesterday!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; to consider what ought to have been
done to have kept him alive -- and so your Servant, 
Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, your Servant. -- Sick People, you
know, are excus'd from Ceremony. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Primrose.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a thorough Doctor now, and talks 
like himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but he goes a little too fast, tho'.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! that's the way of all your eminent 
Physicians.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To cut off an Arm, and pluck out an
Eye, in order to make the other better! I'd rather
'twas not quite so well. A pleasant Operation truly,
to make me at once both blind and lame. -- But
you'll excuse me, Brother, if I go to my Couch and
take a Nap, for I'm so fatigu'd with these Affairs.
If you have a mind to sit by me a Quarter of an Hour,
<pagebreak id="67" />
you'll meet with some very good Books in my Study:
There's a Treatise upon the Virtues of Water-Gruel;
another against eating Fish or Flesh; and another to
prove, that we ought to eat both.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, I'll attend you, Brother.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exeunt Sir</font> Cred. <font>and</font> Heart.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Primrose, <font>as having just thrown off her Doctor's
Dress, and pulling off her Beard</font> .</nonSpeech> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So far, so good: I have look'd out sharp to
all things yet; the Doctor's Business is done, I believe;
and now I'll so fatigue our Country Squire, that he
shall make more haste back again than ever he did to
come. O! here's my Chap, dress'd Bridegroom-like.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Looby.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> , your Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Your Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You seem, Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> , to look at my
Clothes. I was desirous to put my self into the Court
Fashion, for the Credit o' my Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O' my Word, Sir, you make another-guise
Figure than any of our Courtiers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, why so my Tailor told me. The Suit
is rich, and proper for him that wears it, and will
make no small Show and Noise here; Hey? -- But,
pray, can you bring one to the Speech of your 
Lady?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is she gone out, then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Busy, belike?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In Company, may be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Um, um, that's strange indeed!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, look ye, Sir, my Lady is often abroad
and at home, at the same time; engag'd, and yet 
doing nothing; in Company, and yet no Body with
<pagebreak id="68" />
her: In a Word, my Lady's an Oracle, and I am her
Priest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you must be brib'd, I suppose.               
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
-- Give me your Hand, Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> ; let you
and I shake Hands a little, and then, belike, we shall
be better acquainted.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Taking her hand, and putting a Purse in it.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Psha! be quiet. Why, what a Fool 'tis!
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside; seeing the Money.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Um, no, Troth, the
Man has more Wit than I thought he had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I'm marry'd to your Lady, Mrs. 
<font>Primrose</font> , you shall have an excellent Place on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You marry my Lady, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why ay, I'm come on purpose to marry her,
now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To -- to marry her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In Marriage, say ye?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, to be sure; how else can it be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Um -- I'm sorry for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sorry for it!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, I was thinking -- but 'tis no matter,
I beg your Pardon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d'ye mean by that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing, nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, pray now --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing, I tell you; I spoke too hastily.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but I must know what's at the bottom
of all this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, 'tisn't at all necessary you should.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ods my Heart! but it is tho'.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, if it is, you must excuse me there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By what you said o' me, this Morning,
Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> , I took you for my Friend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, marry, no body can be more so; from
the Moment I saw you, I felt an Inclination for you;
I saw something of Ingenuity --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Something lovely --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> !
<pagebreak id="69" /> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So majestick --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, something manly, as one may say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So cordial --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, sweet Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> !
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is all true. -- But here is a Thing that
one's Neighbour's Interest is concern'd in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hark ye, Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> , here's this Ring you
must wear for my sake. -- Nay, 'tis in vain to say,
No; for wear it you must. -- And this, I hope, will
oblige you to open your Heart to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me see, I'll consult my Conscience a 
little on the Case. -- In the first Place, here's my Master
pursuing his own Interest, and endeavouring to 
provide for his Daughter as advantageously as possible, and
we ought to do no Man an Injury in such an Affair.
-- Not that the thing is any manner of Secret; but
shall I go discover it to one who's ignorant of it?
No, we are forbid to speak Evil of our Neighbour,
that's true; but then on the other side --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, now for t'other side!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here's a worthy Gentleman, who's a 
Stranger to the Town --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And has been strangely us'd in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who comes thro' Thick and Thin, with an
honest Intention to marry a Woman he knows nothing
of -- an open-hearted Gentleman -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And a Man of Parts, too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who places a Confidence in me as his Friend, 
has presented me with a Purse most curiously wrought.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of Twenty Guineas.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And a Ring to wear for his Sake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which cost Twenty more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And shall I see this courteous generous 
Gentleman abus'd and impos'd on, without so much as 
telling him of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, to be sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I find I may let you into Matters,
without wounding my Conscience; but let us 
endeavour to tell 'em in the gentlest way possible, and spare
People as much as we can -- To say that this young 
<pagebreak id="70" />
Lady o' mine leads a dishonourable Life, would be a 
little too harsh; let us therefore seek some milder
Terms to express our Meaning by. The Word,
<font>Gay</font> , perhaps may do it; no, that dosn't quite come up
to't -- that of compleat <font>Coquette</font> seems to hit our 
Purpose the best.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cocket! Cocket! What are your Cockets?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! your Coquets, Sir, are your prancing,
prattling, gaming, galloping, witty, wanton, fine
Ladies; who rail at their Friends, jilt their Lovers,
and cuckold their Husbands; and are true to nothing
but Scandal and Strong-waters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oho! are they so? are they so? I am not
such a Coxcomb then, as to have any Business with a
Cocket.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so? there's not so much Harm in't as
People imagine, perhaps.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! isn't there so? I'm your Servant for
that; I'll put no such Cap on my Crown, I assure
ye; the Brows of the <font>Loobies</font> are not made to bear 
Branches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pooh, Pooh! 'tis what Husbands now-a-days
sit down satisfy'd under. If you can't so well bear to
see it done under your very Nose, why, you have 
nothing to do but, when the Galant comes, to take your
Cane and Gloves, and very civilly walk off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good, good! Ha, ha, ha! I am a very
proper Person to be made a Stalking-Horse of, no
doubt. They fansy'd, I warrant ye, that <font>Leonard 
Looby</font> , Esq; had no Guts in his Brains, to inform 
himself how the World went, and to see his Honour well
secur'd in a Wife. -- But I'll go and ferret out old

   <nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hist! <font>Primrose</font> , is the Coast clear?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes, old <font>Argus</font> is employ'd above.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, and how are we? how came you off
with your Scene of Quackery?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As Quacks of all sorts do, Sir; with flying
Colours. I soon routed the Doctor, and run away
with his Business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bravely said! But where's our Squire? what's
doing with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! we are doing very handsomly by him
above Stairs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is the Farce we contriv'd, in Action now,
then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; Ha, ha, ha! He'll have enough of
Wives, I'll warrant him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but what have you for me to do
now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let it be your Business to contrive the 
Winding-up of the Play, while I play my Scenes with him.
-- You understand.
    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay.
    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And as soon as I have planted him as I would --
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Whispers</font> Beaumont.</nonSpeech>
    <nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well; that will do the best of any thing
in the World.

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Looby.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What the Murrain can all this mean? Are
the People in this Town all stark mad?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's the matter, Squire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall certainly be murder'd here in this
cursed Place! -- jabbering Jades! brazen Whores!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How! What's that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, a couple of foul-mouth'd Carrions
have been abusing me at such a rate, within; and 
pretend that I am marry'd to 'em both.
<pagebreak id="72" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry'd to 'em both!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, and threaten me with Justice, and swear
they'll have me hang'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mercy on us! an ugly Business! a very ugly
Business, and Justice here is as rigorous as Vengeance
against that sort of Crime.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay; but I am as innocent o' the Matter as
you be, Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter for that; if you are accus'd of it,
'tis enough. You have nothing for't, but to make your
Escape as soon as you can; there's an Army of 
Constables after you already, I warrant 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lud! O Lud! O Lud! for Goodness
sake, what shall I do, Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> ? Have you ne'er
a dark Room you could hide me in? ne'er a Cupboard
that you could ram me into?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Um! I have hit on't. Come along with me
quickly; I'll tell you the best way to get off, without
being known.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dear Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> , let us be gone then, 
directly, for this Town rains nothing but Plagues.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was ever the like seen? I hope they'll
have him hang'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You had like to have been finely fitted with
a Son-in-law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis very true, that I had so. What shall
I do in this perplexing Affair? I am so confounded,
I can fix on nothing.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Primrose <font>laughing, and rubbing her Hands</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Sir, I have been making Preparations
for the Wedding that's to be to-night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Wedding, Hussy?
<pagebreak id="73" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, Madam <font>Belina</font> and Squire <font>Looby's</font> , Sir.
And, as my Lady is out of the way, I have taken 
upon me to order a handsom Supper, a Concert of 
Musick, and a --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, you meddling Baggage, there's to be
no Wedding, nor no Supper, nor no --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Wedding! ay, but there is, tho'.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you, there is not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lack-a-day! Sir, you forget your self; didn't
you say that it was to be to-night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I did say it, I unsay it again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may do as you will; but marry'd they
shall be, now things are gone so far, that's positive.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heyday! whereabout are we? -- Why
-- why --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have more Love for you than to suffer you
to make your self laugh'd at, for saying and unsaying
in this manner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I want none of your Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I will Love you, in spite of your Teeth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you hold your Tongue, Serpent?
I'll make you be silent, or I'll -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be it so. But if I don't speak, I'll think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Think as much as you will; but take care
you don't speak. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turning to his Brother.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brother, I
am almost mad. What must be done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish I might speak.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She's silent when he turns his Head.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What must be done, Brother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, they must be marry'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then what I say, signifies nothing? Hey!
Baggage, Hey!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What ails you, Sir? I don't speak to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I talk to my Self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Putting himself in a Posture

Brother </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Heartly</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why don't you speak?
<pagebreak id="74" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have thought seriously of it, and it must
be so. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Half aside.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her Insolence has put me mad! How am
I tormented on every hand! -- Ah! Brother, let me
advise you never to marry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never a second time, Brother; and a young
ravenous Widow, too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's not the Thing; I don't speak of
my Lady; she's all the Comfort I have -- but, 
Children, Children, Brother, they are the Bane of 
Matrimony; they are so many Serpents, which a Man
hatches and breeds up only to sting him to Death for
his pains.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We only think 'em so, by not considering
'em as what they are. The little Gaieties and Excesses
of Youth, are as much the Beauty and Perfection of
that State, as Care and Policy are of Age; and yet
because they an't immediately grave and gray-headed,
we are dissatisfy'd and offended.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! Brother, no body knows the Cares,
the Anxieties, the Pangs of a Parent, but those who
feel 'em; I profess, I am quite oppress'd and bore
down by 'em. Ah! <font>Belina, Belina!</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wiping his Eyes.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, come, Brother, this is all Distemper;
we'll talk more of these things by and by: In the 
mean time I have order'd an Entertainment below,
which will dissipate your Concern, and dispose you to
judge the better of what's proper to be done. Things
won't appear so dismal, after a Song and a Dance;
'twill do you more good than all the Drugs in Mr. 
<font>Galleypot's</font> Shop.
In social Mirth, and gay Delights, we find
The truest Cure for a distemper'd Mind.

Fortune herself sits smiling at the Helm.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blessings on her for it!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have put our Chap into such a terrible
Fright, about the Severity of the Law here against
having two Wives, that he's resolv'd to fly for't; and
that he may escape more easily from the Constables,
which I've told him are plac'd in every Corner to 
apprehend him, he's gone to disguise himself in 
Woman's Habit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha! I should be glad to see him in
that Equipage. -- But now, <font>Primrose</font> , what have we
to go upon next?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, we have nothing now to do, but to
sow the Seeds of Discord betwixt Husband and Wife,
and the Day's our own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That will be a difficult Task, I fear; she's a
sly Beast, and won't easily be trap'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Courage, Man; I have Snares for Foxes, as
well as for Woodcocks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art a dear, charming, courageous Wench,
and shalt be rewarded accordingly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But see, here comes our Lass -- away, quick, 
that he mayn't see us together; as soon as I've got
him fairly pack'd off, I shall go to work upon the old

Figure! You've the perfect Air of a Woman o' 
Quality. I defy them to know you in this Equipment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis strange, tho', Mrs. <font>Primrose</font> , that the
Forms of Law should not be observ'd in this Town!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But 'tis as I told you; they hang a Man here,
first, and try him afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But when a Body's innocent --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They never trouble themselves about that. --
Then they have an intolerable Hatred for People of
your Country, and nothing can please 'em more than
to see a <font>Cornish</font> Man hang'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, what have the <font>Cornish</font> Men done to 'em?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! your <font>Londoners</font> are mere Brutes, and
Enemies to the Gentility and Merit of other Places.
For my part, I protest I am in a terrible Fright for
you, and should never have any Comfort if you should
come to be hang'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tisn't so much the Fear of Death, as that
'twould be such a Blot in one's Scutcheon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right, I don't know if you wou'dn't lose
your Title of Squire by it. -- But come, give me your
Hand now, and walk like a Woman; and talk, and 
give yourself all the Airs of Quality.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me alone, I have seen People of Fashion;
all the Mischief is, I have somewhat of a Beard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pho! your Beard's nothing; I have known
many Women of Quality have a great deal more --
Come, let us see a little how you behave yourself. --

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ho! good <font>Assa-foetida</font> is a good thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Brother, since this Match is now at
an End, and you and your Doctor are at Variance
with one another, I hope I may have the Liberty to
propose the Person I was speaking of for my Niece.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Brother, I'm resolv'd to send her 
into the Country, and there confine her, for offering
to oppose my Will and Pleasure. I find there's a 
Love-Affair under the Rose, and have discovered a 
certain private Interview, which they don't think I
have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very good, Brother; and suppose there
should be some little Inclination in the Case, where
would be the Harm of it? You have no reason to be
displeas'd, since nothing's intended but what's 
honourable.
<pagebreak id="79" />

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Primrose.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can guess, Brother, who put you on that
Resolution. There's one Person in the World you'll
please by it, I'm certain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I understand you, Sir; you are always
touching on that String. My Wife is a great 
Heartburn to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Brother, since 'tis necessary to be plain
with you, 'tis your Wife that I mean; and I can no
more bear you ridiculous Fondness for her, than that
you have for Physick; nor endure to see you run 
hand-over-head into all the Snares she lays for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! dear Sir, don't speak so of my Lady;
she's a Woman that no body can say any thing against;
a Woman without the least Grain of Artifice or 
Design, and loves my Master -- there's no saying how
much she loves him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ask but her now, how excessive fond
she is of me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most excessive!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much Concern my Illness gives
her. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True -- she's always praying that she might
see an End of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And the Care and Pains she takes about 
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right. -- Shall we convince you now,
Mr. Heartly, and shew you directly what a 
surprising Affection my Lady has for my Master? --  
Permit me, Sir, to undeceive him, and let him see his
Mistake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As how, <font>Primrose</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hark, my Lady is just return'd. Do you,
Sir, but stretch your self out in your Chair, and feign
your self dead, you'll then see the violent Grief, she'll
be in, when I tell her the News.
<pagebreak id="80" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hey! -- Um! -- I profess I've a mind
to take her Advice. -- No, no, I can never bear to
hear the Shrieks and Lamentations she'll make over
me; and yet 'twill be a Comfort to me to hear them,
too; to feel her virtuous Tears bedew my Face, and
her sweet Lips kissing my Cheeks a thousand, 
thousand times, to bring me back again to Life and her. --
Ah! Ah! verily, I'll do it; verily, I'll do it. And
then, Sir, what will become of your fine Surmises?
-- But, <font>Primrose</font> , ar't thee not afraid that her very
thinking me dead, will break her Heart?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To be sure, Sir, if you should keep her in
her Fright too long.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! let me alone for that; I'll make the 
Experiment this very Minute, this very Minute. -- 
Reach my Chair, here. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Settling himself.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you hide your self in that Closet, Sir.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Heartly.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But is there no Danger in feigning one's
self dead?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no; what Danger should there be?
'Tis only shutting your Eyes, and stretching your self
out. -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To</font> Heartly.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, now, Sir, we shall
shew you your Error, with a Witness, and convince
you how much you have injur'd the best of Wives.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>To Sir</font> Cred.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twill be pleasant enough 
afterwards, Sir, to see how blank your Brother will look.
-- Here's my Lady! Close, close, you've no 
Business with your Cane; hang your Arms a little more
dangling; and look more dismal, than ordinary, if
possible.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lady</font> Hippish.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Heavens! Oh fatal Misfortune! What a
strange Accident is this!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's the Matter, <font>Primrose</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! Madam. Ah! Ah!   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crying.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is it? What dost thee mean by
this Blubbering, pr'ythee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Master's dead, Madam. Oh! Oh!
<pagebreak id="81" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Dead!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, alas! quite defunct.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Art thou sure of that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Too sure, alas! No body yet knows any
thing of this Accident; there was not a Soul but my
self to help him; he sunk down in my Arms, and
went off like a Child. -- See there, Madam, how
he lies stretch'd out in his Chair!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, Heaven be prais'd for the Sight:
-- <font>Primrose</font> ! what a Simpleton art thou, to
cry?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cry, Madam? Why, I thought we was to
cry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A great Loss indeed, to cry for! What
good did he do above Ground? -- A grunting,
grumbling, ill-shap'd, filthy Fellow; never without
some poisonous Slop in his Maw; always coughing,
hauking, and spitting; for ever dying, and yet too
much alive to get him under Ground. -- Thou
poor, pitiful, credulous Fool, farewel. -- 
Sweet, charmimg, wanton Widowhood, thou only
Recompence for Marriage Slavery! thou only End
and Aim of prudent Wives! once more, thou'rt 
welcome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very excellent Funeral Oration. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! how my Heart exults at Thought
of Liberty, and long neglected Joys! -- Alas! poor
Dear, thou hast lost, then, the small matter of Breath
thou wer't Master of. O' my Conscience, he looks
better than when he was alive. This is the only time,
<font>Primrose</font> , I ever beheld him with Pleasure. -- But,
come, thou must assist me in executing my Design;
and, depend on't, that in serving me, thou wilt most
effectually serve thy self. Since then, by good 
Fortune, no body's yet acquainted with the Thing, let
us carry him to his Bed, and keep his Death conceal'd
'till we have thoroughly settled our Affairs; and then, 
<font>Primrose</font> , I'll enjoy the Pleasure of Revenge too, in
its turn, and make Miss <font>Belina</font> pay swingingly for her
<pagebreak id="82" />
Insolence. Hah! here she comes, and her Fellow
with her; this is a little unlucky.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Confusion! What brings them here
now? What can be the Meaning of this? or, what
will be the Consequence of this critical Scene? -- 
I wish I could give them Notice, that they might
know how to behave -- but 'tis impossible; we must
stand it, now.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Beaumont <font>and</font> Belina.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>As he enters.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, <font>Belina</font> , your    
Uncle has,
by this time, made my Proposal to your Father; I'll
therefore no longer trust my Passion to precarious
Artifice, but make my Claim with Openness and 
Honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What ails thee, <font>Primrose</font> ? Why those Tears?
How does my Father do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's the matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas! he's dead, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Father dead! <font>Primrose?</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, you see him there; he expir'd this 
Moment in a Fit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Faints.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hah! help her, <font>Primrose</font> , she faints.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tender Creature! -- But see, she 
recovers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a cruel Stroke, indeed! to lose my
Father, who was every thing in the World to me;
and to lose him at a Time too, when he had conceiv'd
a Displeasure against me! the Thought of this adds
Stings to my Affliction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be comforted, Madam, nor strive to 
aggravate your Grief by such Reflexions; <font>Beaumont</font> will
supply the Loss of a Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, <font>Beaumont</font> , let's talk no more of any
such thing; I'm determin'd to retire into the Country,
and be no longer conversant in this World. -- Yes,
<pagebreak id="83" />
my dear Father, if I have formerly oppos'd your 
Inclinations, I'll now execute one of your Intentions at
least, and atone by that for the Disquiet I have given
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have Liberty to go, Child, as soon
as you please. -- I have a Will in my Pocket, here,
which takes all manner of Trouble off your Hands:
and you may soon pack up, I believe, all that belongs
to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes indeed, Madam, your Father has left the
sole Disposal of every thing to her Ladyship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then my Calamity's compleat, indeed. -- 
My Father! No, he did not, could not do it; 'twas
that artful, wicked Wife, who seduc'd him into an
Action so contrary both to his Reason and Nature.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let not that Particular, Madam, add any
thing to your Distress; you have still an affluent 
Fortune at command, and I rejoice at this Opportunity
of adding some little Merit to my Passion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, you both act your Parts 
miraculously well!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Act, do you say? No, Madam, I'm no
more a Countefeit in Grief, than you are in Joy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, really, Child, we have both 
reason enough to be in earnest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Barbarous Monster! to insult a Poverty, her
own Treachery was the Cause of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I shall not resign my Right so tamely as
you may think; the World shall be made acquainted
with the Story, Madam. -- Yes, Madam, it shall
know by what scandalous Methods you practis'd on
my Father's easy Temper, to ruin, most 
unnaturally ruin his own Children, to glut your Appetite for
Wealth -- and then, how ungratefully, how 
savagely you revell'd at the Death of this good deluded
Husband, whose only Crime was being fond of such a
Wife. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Wiping her Eyes.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whilst you entertain yourself with
these fine Reflexions, Child, I'll beg leave to go and
<pagebreak id="84" />
settle a little necessary Business. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going out, returns.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
But hold, in the first Place, let me search for his Keys,
for there's Money and Papers I ought to secure.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going to his Pockets.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Starting up.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Softly, softly, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Omnes.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hah!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, Mrs. Wife, is this your Extreme Love
and Fondness for me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bless us! the dead Man alive again!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Looking for some time scornfully on his  
Wife,
and then running to</font> Belina.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! my dear Girl, come
to my Arms, let me embrace thee, my Child. Thou
art my own Daughter, my own Flesh and Blood, and
I'm overjoy'd to discover so much Good-nature in
thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How welcome and agreeable is this 
Surprize!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>To Lady</font> Hip.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm very glad, 
Madam, I've discover'd your Affection, too, and heard
the fine Panegyrick you made upon me. -- A 
grunting, grumbling, filthy Fellow; always hauking, 
coughing, and spitting. -- Hey! Mistress. Ah! this
is such a Lesson as will make me wiser for the future,
I believe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis such a Lesson, Fool, as I shall make
thee repent having ever got from me. Thou shalt pay
so dear for thy Wisdom, as shall make thee wish thy
self in easy Delusion again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mercy o' me! What a Woman 'tis! --
Hark ye, Madam, don't threaten, for I shall now
make you go seek your Fortune, instead of my 
Daughter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wilt thou so, Man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall procure a Will to take all manner
of Trouble off your Hands; so you may soon pack
up, I believe, all that belongs to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Omnes.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say'st thou so, my Soul? Hast thou
forgot, then, the Five Thousand Guineas, and as
<pagebreak id="85" />
much more in Notes, that were hid behind the 
Wainscot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ods my Heart! what a Fool have I 
been!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And now, thou shalt be altogether as
great a Wretch; for I'll so chastise thee for this 
Curiosity! I'll so trample on thee, Worm!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out o' my House, I say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha! You talk wildly, my Dear;
you are light-headed, and don't know it. -- To bed,
to bed, Child, and send for a Doctor and Nurse, in an
Instant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, Madam! I can no longer bear to
see my Father abus'd in this manner; and must tell
you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Peace, Peace, Child, and shut your
Mouth again; you'll say some foolish thing else, that
will make one blush for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Belina.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blush! Fy on you! you are an audacious
wicked Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Beau.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, Madam, 'tis in vain to make any 
Opposition; where all Sense of Shame and Decency is
lost, Reproof is but thrown away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! your Servant, Sir! by your sage
Looks and profound Silence, I really mistook you for
a rational Creature; but an Ass is soon known when
he offers to bray.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'gad, she'll prove too many for them all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there ever such Impudence! I shall
go mad indeed! I -- I -- I'm all on Fire!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lady Hip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then set open the Windows, and cool
your self, my Love, whilst I go abroad in pursuit of
Pleasure. I have been coop'd in an Hospital long 
enough; 'tis but just I should now enjoy the Fruit of
my Labour. -- Oh! I shall so harass you, my Dear,
that you shall wish your self as dead as you pretended
to be. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Lady</font> Hip.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Following her to the Door.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you 
so,
Mistress? Will you so, Mistress? I'll take care how
<pagebreak id="86" />
you make use of your insolent Tongue in this House
any more, tho'. -- I -- I -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Returning.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why,
why, what a shameless, terrible Tigress, am I yok'd
to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>From the Closet.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, Brother, now you
see --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sir Cred.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes; and hear too with a 
Vengeance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I swear solemnly, I could never have imagin'd
this.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Heart.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> However, Brother, the Stratagem has not
been amiss, since by this means you have discover'd the 
real Sentiments of your Family, and learnt where to
place your Affection and Favours.
