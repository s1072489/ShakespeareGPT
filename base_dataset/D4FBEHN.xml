HER SISTER CHARLOT.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>but
he no sooner advanc'd a step or
two towards 'em, to that purpose
(for he followed them) but his
Heart fail'd, and a certain awe
and reverence, or rather the fears
and tremblings of a Lover, 
prevented him, but when he
consider'd that possibly he might
never have so favourable an
opportunity again, he resolv'd 
anew, and call'd up so much
Courage to his Heart as to speak
to <font>Atlante</font> , but before he did so,
<font>Charlot</font> looking behind her, saw
<font>Rinaldo</font> very near to 'em, and
cry'd out with a voice of Joy:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Oh! Sister, Sister, look where the
handsom <font>Monsieur</font> , is just behind
us, sure he is some body of Quality,
for see he has two Foot-men that
follow him in just such Liveries,
and so Rich, as those of our
Neighbour <font>Monsieur Bellyaurd</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>at
<pagebreak id="21" />
this <font>Atlante</font> could not forbear,
but before she was aware of it,
turn'd her Head and look't on
<font>Rinaldo</font> , which incourag'd him
to advance, and putting off his
Hat, which he clapt under his
Arm, with a low Bow, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ladies you are so slenderly attended,
and so many Accidents arrive to
the fair in the rude Streets, that
I humbly implore you will permit
me, whose Duty it is, as a
Neighbour, to wait on you to your
Door, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Atlante</font> blushing,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
we fear no insolence, and need no
Protector, or if we did we should
not be so rude to take you out of
your way to serve us; Madam
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my way lyes yours, I live
at the next door and am Son to
<font>Bellyaurd</font> your Neighbour; but
Madam </dialogue><nonSpeech>added he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if I were to 
go all my Life out of the way to
do you Service, I should take it
for the greatest Happiness, that
could arrive to me, but Madam,
<pagebreak id="22" />
sure a Man can never be out of
his way, who has the Honour of
so Charming Company, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Atlante</font>
made no reply at this, but blusht
and bow'd, but <font>Charlot</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay
Sir, if you are our Neighbour we
will give you leave to Conduct
us home; but pray Sir, how came
you to know we are your 
Neighbours, for we never saw you
before to our knowledge. My
pretty <font>Mis</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Rinaldo</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I knew it from the transcendent
Beauty that appear'd in your Faces
and fine Shapes, for I have heard
there was no Beauty in the World
like that of <font>Atlante's</font> , and I no
sooner saw her but my Heart told
me it was she; Heart, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Charlot</font> ,
Laughing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> why does Heart use to
speak; the most intelligibly of
any thing, </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Rinaldo</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> when
'tis tenderly toucht, when 'tis
charm'd and transported, </dialogue><nonSpeech>at these
words he sight, and <font>Atlante</font> to
his extream satisfaction blusht;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<pagebreak id="23" />
toucht, charm'd and transported,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Charlot</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what's that? and how
do you do to have it be all these
things? for I would give any thing
in the World to have my Heart
speak: Oh! </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rinaldo</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> your
Heart is too young, it is not yet
arriv'd to the Years of speaking,
about thirteen or fourteen it may
possibly be saying a thousand soft
things to you, but it must first be
inspir'd by some Noble Object,
whose Idea it must retain; what
</dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd, this pretty Pratler,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le
warrant I must be in Love? Yes,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rinaldo</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> most passionately, or
you will have but little
Conversation with your Heart, Oh! </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd
she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am afraid the pleasure of
such a Conversation will not 
make me amends for the Pain that
Love will give me, that, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Rinaldo</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is according as the Object
is kind, and as you hope, if he
Love, and you hope you will
have a double Pleasure, and in
<pagebreak id="24" />
this how great an advantage have
you fair Ladies above us Men:
'tis almost impossible for you to
Love in vain, you have your
choice of a thousand Hearts which
you have subdu'd, and may not
only chuse your Slaves but be
assur'd of 'em; without speaking
you are belov'd, it needs not cost
you a sigh or tear; but unhappy
Man is often destin'd to give his
Heart, where it is not regarded, to
sigh, to weep and languish without
any hope of Pitty. You speak
so feelingly, Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Charlot</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that
I am afraid this is your Case;
Yes, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Rinaldo</font> ,
sighing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am that unhappy Man; 
indeed 'tis pitty </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> pray how
long have you been so? ever
since I heard of the charming
<font>Atlante</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd he, sighing again,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I ador'd her Character, but now
I have seen her, I dye for her; for
me, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Atlante</font> (who had not
yet spoke,</nonSpeech><dialogue> this is the common
<pagebreak id="25" />
compliment of all the young Men,
who pretend to be Lovers, and
if one should pitty all those
sighers, we shou'd have but very 
littel left for our selves; I believe, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Rinaldo</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> there are none that tell
you so, who do not mean as they 
say, yet among all those adorers
and those that say they will dye
for you, you will find none will be
so good as their words as <font>Rinaldo</font> ,
perhaps </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Atlante</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> of all those
who tell me of dying, there are
none that tell it with so little
reason as <font>Rinaldo</font> , if that be your
Name Sir; <font>Madam</font> it is, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and
who am Transported with an
unspeakable joy, to hear those
last words from your fair mouth,
and let me Oh! Lovely <font>Atlante</font> ,
assure you that what I have said,
are not words of Course, but
proceed from a heart that has
vow'd it self, eternally yours,
even before, I had the happiness
to behold this Divine Person, but
<pagebreak id="26" />
now that my Eyes have made
good all my heart before 
imagin'd, and did but hope, I swear
I will dye a Thousand deaths,
rather then violate what I have
said to you, that I adore you,
that my Soul and all my 
faculties are charm'd with your 
Beauty and Innocence, and that my 
Life and Fortune, not 
inconsiderable, shall be laid at your 
Feet: </dialogue><nonSpeech>this he spoke with a
fervency of passion, that left her 
no doubt of what he had 
said; yet she blush't for shame, 
and a little angry at her self, 
for suffering him to say so much 
to her, the very first time she saw 
him, and accused her self for 
giving him any incouragement: 
and in this confusion she reply'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir, you have said too much to 
be believ'd, and I cannot imagin 
so short an acquaintance can 
make so considerable an 
Impression, of which confession I 
<pagebreak id="27" />
accuse my self much more than 
you, in that I did not only harken 
to what you said, without 
forbiding you to entertain me at 
that rate, but for unheedily 
speaking something, that has 
incourag'd this boldness; for so must I
call it in a Man, so great a 
stranger to me: <font>Madam</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if I 
have offended by the suddainess 
of my presumptious discovery, I 
beseech you to consider my 
reasons for it, the few opportunities 
I am like to have, and the
impossibility of waiting on you, 
both from the severity of your 
Father and mine; who 'ere I 
saw you, warn'd me of my Fate, 
as if he foresaw, I should fall in 
Love as soon as I should chance 
to see you; and for that reason 
has kept me closer to my Studies, 
than hitherto I have been, 
and from that time I began to 
feel a Flame, which was kindled 
by report alone, and the 
<pagebreak id="28" />
Description my Father gave of your 
wonderous and dangerous 
Beauty: therefore <font>Madam</font> , I have 
not suddainly told you of my 
passion, I have been long your 
Lover, and have long Languisht
without telling of my Pain, and 
you ought to Pardon it now, 
since it is done with all the 
respect and Religious Awe, that 
'tis possible for a heart to deliver 
and unload it self in; therefore 
<font>Madam</font> , if you have by chance 
uttered any thing, that I have 
taken advantage or hope from, 
I assure you 'tis so small, that 
you have no reason to repent it; 
but rather if you wou'd have 
me live, send me not from you, 
without a confirmation of that 
little hope; see <font>Madam</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he, 
more earnestly and trembling,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
see we are almost arriv'd at our 
homes, send me not to mine in 
a despair, that I cannot support 
with Life, but tell me I shall be 
<pagebreak id="29" />
blest with your Sight sometimes 
in your Balcony, which is very 
near to a jetting Window in our
House, from whence I have sent 
many a longing look towards 
yours, in hope to have seen my 
Souls Tormenter; I shall be very 
unwilling, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to enter into 
an intreague of Love, or 
Friendship with a Man, whose Parents
will be averse to my happiness, 
and possibly mine as refractory, 
though he cannot but know such 
an Alliance wou'd be very 
considerable; my Fortune being not  
suitable to yours, I tell you this, 
that you may withdraw in time
from a Engagement, in which I find 
there will be a great many 
Obstacles Oh! <font>Madam</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Rinaldo</font> ,
sighing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if my Person be not 
disagreeable to you; you will have no
cause to fear the rest, 'tis that I 
dread, and that which is all my fear, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>he sighing beheld her with a 
Languishing look, that told her, he 
<pagebreak id="30" />
expected her answer, when she
reply'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, if that will be 
Satisfaction enough for you at this 
time, I do assure you, I have no 
aversion for your Person, in which 
I find more to be vallu'd than 
in any I have yet seen, and if 
what you say be real, and 
proceed from a heart truly affected, 
I find in spight of me, you will 
oblige me to give you hope.

the Window was so near her, he 
could easily be heard by her) and 
told her he was infinitely indebted 
to her Bounty, for giving him an 
opportunity yesterday of falling 
on that discourse, which had made 
him the happiest Man in the
World, he said, if she had not 
by her agreeable Conversation 
incourag'd him, and drawn him 
from one word to another, he 
should never have had the 
confidence to have told <font>Atlante</font> , how 
much he ador'd her;</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am very 
glad, </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd <font>Charlot</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that I was 
the occasion of the beginning of 
an Amour which was displeasing 
to neither one nor to the other, 
for I assure you for your comfort, 
my Sister nothing but thinks on 
you, we lye together and you 
<pagebreak id="37" />
have taught her already to sigh 
so, that I could not sleep for her; 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>at this his Face was covered 
over with a rising Joy which his 
Heart could not contain, and 
after some more discourse in which 
this innocent Girl discover'd 
more then <font>Atlante</font> wisht she should, 
he besought her to become his 
Advocate, and since she had no 
Brother, to give him leave to 
assume that Honour, and call her 
Sister, thus by degrees he 
flattered her into a consent of
carrying a Letter from him to <font>Atlante</font> , 
which she who believ'd all as 
innocent as her self, and being not 
forbid to do so, immediately 
consented to,</nonSpeech> <omission type="sentence" />

<pagebreak id="47" />
<omission type="sentence" /> <nonSpeech>as soon as they were 
come into the Pleasure Boat,
unseen of any, he kneel'd at the 
Feet of <font>Atlante</font> , and there utter'd 
so many passionate and tender 
things to her, with a voice so 
trembling and soft, with Eyes so 
Languishing, and a Fervency and 
Fire so sincere, that her young 
Heart wholly uncapable of 
Artifice, could no longer resist such 
Language, and such Looks of 
Love, she grows tender, and he 
perceives it in her fine Eyes, who 
<pagebreak id="48" />
could not dissemble, he reads her 
Heart in her Looks, and found it
yielding apace, and therefore 
Assaults it anew, with fresh forces 
of Sighs and Tears, he implores 
she would assure him of her 
Heart, which she could no other 
way do then by yeilding to 
Marry him; he would carry her to 
the next Village, there 
consummate that Happiness, without 
which he was able to live no 
longer, for he had a thousand 
Fears, that some other Lover was, 
or would, suddainly be provided 
for her, and therefore he would 
make sure of her, while he had 
this opportunity; and to that 
end he answered all the 
Objections, she would make, to the 
contrary: but ever when he nam'd 
Marriage, she trembled with fear of 
doing something that she fancy'd 
she ought not to do without the 
Consent of her Father, she was 
sensible of the Advantage, but 
<pagebreak id="49" />
had been so us'd to a strict 
Obedience, that she could not 
without Horror think of Violating it,
and therefore besought him, as 
he valu'd her Repose, not to 
urge her to that, and told him 
further that if he fear'd any Rival, 
she would give him what other 
Assurance and Satisfaction he 
pleas'd, but that of Marriage, 
which she could not consent to, 
till she knew such an Aliance
would not be Fatal to him; for 
she fear'd as passionately as he 
lov'd her, when he should find 
she had occasion'd him the loss 
of his Fortune, or his Fathers 
Affection, he would grow to hate 
her; tho' he answered to this, all
that a fond Lover could urge, 
yet she was resolv'd, and he was
forc'd to content himself with 
obliging her by his Prayers and 
Protestations, his Sighs and his
showers of Tears to a Contract,

   <nonSpeech>She said, she believ'd she need 
not fear any such Persecution, since 
he was a Man, who was not at

much of the <font>Satyr</font> in his Humour 
to harbour any softness there: and 
Nature had form'd his Body to

going out of the Church, and that

when they came in, they found 
Count <font>Vernole</font> , who had been 
inspiring <font>De Pais</font> with Severity,

Young <font>Ladies</font> , for being too long

to their Devotion, nor was it 
enough for him to set the Father

she had too many Lovers, not 
to make them doubt that this was 
a Design'd thing, and that she 
had heard Love from some one, 
for whom it was designed: To 
this she made him but a short 
reply, that if it was so, she had no
reason to conceal it, since she had 
Sense enough to look after herself,

to her, he might be assur'd it was 
some one, whose Quality and

on to another Room, and left 
him silently raging within with 
Jealousie. Which if before she 
tormented him, this Declaration

at a Window, and that if she 
wou'd give him leave, he wou'd
by a Rope or two, ty'd together,

ascend her Balcony; he not 
having time to provide a Ladder 
of Ropes: she tells him, she has 
so great a confidence in his 
vertue and Love, that she will 
refuse him nothing, though it will 
be a very bold venture for a 
Maid, to trust her self with a 
passionate young Man, in silence 
of Night; and though she did 
not exert a vow from him to 
<pagebreak id="67" />
secure her, she expected he wou'd

there needed not many vows to
