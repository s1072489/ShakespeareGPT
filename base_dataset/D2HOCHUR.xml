   <nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
   Trulie Cousen I am sorie that
you should thus vpo~ a pievish
conceite of yours bring your
self into this vn-necessarie trouble
for a trifle and matter of nothing as
it were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Woman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
   If you be sorie indeed as you pretende,
then you might haue let me alone, and not
haue caused your Apparitor to serue me
(as he did) with Citation, for assure your
selfe if you had not troubled me, I would
never haue troubled my selfe about this
trifle you speake of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I must not do so, I must deale
indifferentlie you know, and not be
partiall though you be my
<pagebreak id="3" />
kinswoman. Th'information being against
you as well as others, &amp; your name
being prese~ted to me by the church
Wardens with other women moe,
if I should leaue you out and
proceed against them, I should not doe
that which were fitting for my place
and office, you know I am sworne
to doe iustice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed your office and place afoordes
much iustice, if it be well observed, as
ordinarie iustice as Billinsgate doeth loue &amp;
friendship for a boxe of th'eare: you are
sworne you saye, and will not that oath of
yours alow you to shew as much favor and
kindnesse to your kinswoman in a trifle, as
to a stranger that is no kinne to you in a
matter of weight?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O I knowe where you are now, I
thought where you would bee
straight, I knew I should heare of it,
you meane mistres <font>A. B.</font> But in good
faith your Minister did her wrong,
neither had he anie law to warrant
<pagebreak id="4" />
him to doe that he vrged her vnto:
I co~fesse she made a fault before she 
was maried, but the man you know
made her amendes, and I doe not
heare but that they liue orderly and
well nowe: notwithstandinge all
which your hotte spirited Minister
(of spight &amp; malice as it is thought)
would haue put them both to open
penance, if I had not stucke close to
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mercifull Christ, what neede anie
witnesse to be produced against you, when your
owne mouth doeth so apparantlie co~demne
you? The gentlewoman you confesse made
a fault: and what was that fault but
simple Fornicatio~ at the least? For the which
our Minister would haue done that which
belonged vnto him, if you would haue lett
him, and that whiche I take it (by your
leaue) the Booke of common Prayer it selfe
doeth warrant him to doe, and you by your
owne confession withstoode him in that
good purpose of his. Nowe surely (my good
<pagebreak id="5" />
kinsman) this is a sinne amongest others that
you must repent of, otherwise it wilbe woe
with you. And I pray you tel me one thing:
Mistres A. B. is a straunger to you and I
am your kinswoman, her fault (cover it &amp;
shadow it as you will) was vncleannesse at
the least, and that which you trouble mee
for, is but a Ceremonie, &amp; as your self
confesse, a matter of no moment. What
warrant haue you then so stiflie to stande with
her in her sinne, and to deale thus sharplie
with me and others in a thing indifferent,
or a matter of nothing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well gentle kinswoman, seeing
you are so snappish &amp; over-busying
your self in other folkes matters that
apperteine not vnto you, I pray you
let me heare now how handsomely
you can answere for your selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> With whose matters did I medle I pray
you, did not you first name mistresse A. B.
your selfe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All is one for that, I know you
meant her when you said, that my
<pagebreak id="6" />
oath might as well alow me to shew 
fauour to my kinswoman in a trifle,
as to a stra~ger in a matter of weight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well be it so then: if your conscience did
accuse you, looke you to that: But what
haue you now to say to me, and what is the
cause why you haue sent for me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You neede not aske, you know it
well enough I am sure. It is for your
foolish nicenesse in this trifling
matter of Churching. And I pray you
in good sadnesse, what reason haue
you why you refuse to be
Churched?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If it be as you say a trifle, the more to
blame you to trouble your friends in so
trifling a cause: But what doe you meane by
Churching? Doe you meane that which is
sett downe in the Booke?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Iust, I meane that and none other:
For law will not warrant vs to presse
you to any other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No. nor I thinke to that neither if it
be well examined: But seeing you meane
<pagebreak id="7" />
that kinde of Churching, The reason in a
woord why I refuse it is this: Because I
would be loth to shew my selfe either Iew
or Papist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why will thankesgiuing to God
after Childbirth make you a Iew or
a Papist?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No: Thankesgiuing will not: But this
manner of thankesgiving that you would
haue me to obserue is in trueth no
thankesgiving at all, but a meere Iewish or Popish
Purifying.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How doe you proove it to be no
thankesgiuing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> By the verie first institution of it: For
the Papistes that were the woorshipfull
founders and devisers of it, and knew best
their own meaning, did in the instituting
of it, giue it this title: <font>The Purification
of Women after Childbirth</font> . 
Whereby it is manifest that their very drift and
intent in th'institution was only for a
Purification or Purging, and therefore no
thankesgiving: Secondly, there is no one
<pagebreak id="8" />
woord, matter or forme of thankesgiuing
in the whole order of it as it is set downe in
the booke: and therefore it can not be that
it was ordayned for Thankesgivinge,
though in the title thereof it be absurdlie
so called.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But why doe you tearme it a
Iewish or a Popish Purifying?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is Iewish in 2 respectes: First in that
the woman after she hath brought foorth
a childe, is held vncleane (as vnder the
Law) till such time as she hath shewed her
selfe in the Temple. Secondlie in that shee
is commanded to offer her accustomed
offeringes, which is drawen &amp; deriued from
the Lamb and young Pigeons vnder the
Law. Popish it is in 3 respectes: First in
that it was instituted and devised by the
Papistes, apishlie imitating the Iewes, and
bringing in one kinde of Purifying in
steade of another. Secondly in that the
woman is commaunded to come as neare the
communion table, as in the time of popery
they came to the high Altar. Lastlie, in
<pagebreak id="9" />
regard of the Popish offeringe, to weete the
Chrisome: For she is commaunded to
offer th'accustomed offeringes, which is sett
downe to be the Chrisome, In which
regard you may as iustlie trouble me and cal
me hither for not offering the Chrisome,
as for not being purifyed, and as good law
you haue for th'one as th'other, whiche
makes me thinke (as I sayed before) that
you haue no law amongest you (but onelie
the lawlesse law of your will and pleasure)
to compell any woman to be Churched.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, wee will talke of that
another time: but I would to God, yee
foolish women would medle with
that whiche belongs vnto you, and
which is within the co~passe of your
owne element, and not take vppon
you the decision and interpretation
of the law, which ye vndersta~d not.
But I pray you tell me one thinge,
what if the Church now would
institute and ordeyne a solemne
<font>Purifying</font> of women, would you not bee
<pagebreak id="10" />
purified?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No indeed would I not: For if I should,
I should then either with the Iewes denie
Christ to be come in the fleshe to giue an
end to those shadowes which were figures
of the purifying and washing away of our
sinnes by his bloud, or els with the Papistes
I must denie the bloudshead and sufferings
of Christ to be th'only and alone sufficient
purgation of sinne, and therefore it is that
we must haue a supply and be farther
holpen by some Church Ceremonie, or
outward forme of Prayers out of the mouth
of some shaveling or Priest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, but see now I pray you how
you are deceyved in the heate of
your zeale, looke in the booke there
is no such matter of <font>Purifying</font> as you
speake of, but onelie of 
<font>Thankesgiving</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Trust me, you say true, I had almost
forgotten that it speaketh not a woord indeed
of Purifying. But what a iugling &amp;
blearing of th'eis of the simple is this amongst
<pagebreak id="11" />
you. May we not heerein say of you &amp; your
fellowes, that yee are the most perillous
instrumentes, and dangerous impostors that
euer Sathan raysed vp for
th'advancement and restoring againe of Poperie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so I pray you my good
kinswoman? What neede all this
heate among friendes? You
imagine belike you are amo~g your
scolding dames and pratling huswiues
at home?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No good Maister Chauncelor, I know I
thanke God where I am, neither am I any
whitte distempered at all: But that
whiche I haue sayed, I may truly and 
lawfullie say againe: In which regard well fare
the Papistes say I, for they shall rise vp in
iudgement against you, who like good
fellowes yet in playne and open tearmes, euen
bare faced, as it were, doe seeke to seduce
vs, and to drawe vs to their false and
idolatrous woorship and service in Poperie,
as namelie by their Masse, Mattens,
Ensong, Purification, and other such like:
<pagebreak id="12" />
Whereas you much more dangerously and
euen vnder a maske or visard as it were,
and not vnlike to him that transformeth
him selfe into an Angell of light, doe goe
about to drawe and allure vs to the selfe
same false worship &amp; service but by
cleanlier names and honester titles, as to their
Purification by the title and name of
Thankesgiving, that is, to a Iewish
Ceremonie that should be abolished, vnder the
pretence &amp; colour of a seruice of God that
should be continued.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I pray you Cousen Puritane,
is there no difference betwixt that in
Poperie and ours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The difference (as I haue bene tolde by
learned men) is onely in this, That theirs
is in Latin &amp; yours in English, otherwise
you proper Thankesgiuing which yee call
Churching, is even the very same woord
for woord (excepting only the Title,
wherin (as I saye) yee iuggle and walke a little
more covertly then they) with their
Purification in Poperie. And can the changing
<pagebreak id="13" />
of a name or title alter the thing it selfe or
make it of another nature? If yee haue
that gift and power amongst you, then yee
may as well bring vs in the Masse vnder
the name and title of a Communion: and
so he that refuseth to goe to Masse, you may
serue him with a Citatio~ for not comming
to the Communion, as in the like case you
doe now by vs, you trouble vs and call vs
in questio~ for denying of Thankesgiuing,
because we refuse to be Purified.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In good faith it is more the~ I haue
considered of, whether that in
Poperie be so neare agreeing to ours as
you speak of, I beleeue your leaders
haue mis-informed you. But
howsoeuer it be and howsoeuer the
Papistes doe holde and account of it, it
makes no great matter. The Church
you see now holdeth it for no other
then a meere <font>Thankesgiuing</font> , which is
very decent <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: deeent</comment> and requisite for euerie
woman after so great deliuerance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What if the Church should holde our
<pagebreak id="14" />
Ladies Psalter to be Davids Psalter, or
th'Aue <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: t'hAue</comment> Marie for a Prayer? Should I
therefore take and vse th'one for Davids
Psalter, and th'other for a Prayer? I
know the Lord is to be thanked for all his
mercies, much more for so great a
blessing as Childbirth is: But as we are to giue
God thankes, and are therevnto tyed and
bound in duetie and allegeance: so are we
still to doe the same according to the
pleasure of him that commaundeth, and after
the square and rule of his ordinance, and
not after the preceptes, phansies and
inventions of men, especiallie after the
prescription of the man of Synne, that is after
the manner of the superstitious and
idolatrous Papistes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But in faith doe you not thinke it
a decent thing, that after so great an
escape, and for the birth of a babe
into the worlde, there should bee
Thanksgiving? or would you haue
no difference <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: differeuce</comment> betwixt reasonable
creatures and beastes, but that it
<pagebreak id="15" />
should bee left indifferent to
vnrulie men to accompanie with their
wives at their pleasures, without
regard of their weaknes and
vncleannesse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Woman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You aske me wonderfull strange things:
First, whether it be not a decent thing
vpon such a deliuerance and the birth of a
Babe into the worlde, there should not bee
Thankesgiving. Secondlie, whether it
should bee left indifferent for men to playe
the beastes with their wives. Vnto which
I aunswere, that the manner of Churching
that you thus trouble vs for, doeth not
redresse anie of these inconveniences: There
being in it in trueth no maner of
Thanksgiving at all, but onelie a speach or
superscription of a Thankesgiving. Secondlie,                        
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Socondlie,</comment>
whereas by the law of God, to touch a
woman in the time of her separation and
vncleanesse, should bee death, what
punishment haue you prouided for this so
great and haynous enormitie? Or howe
doeth your Churching of women restraine
<pagebreak id="16" />
a carnall and licentious appetite from
executing his villenous and beastlie desire?
Hath he not his full swindge and libertie
to doe what he list for all that? So that yee
complaine of dangers, disorders, &amp;
inconveniences, and yet leaue them still as you
found them without cure or redresse, neuer
caring for anie thing so your ydle
Ceremonie may be kept.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A man may easelie smell (gentle
Cousen) where you haue bene at
schoole, yet I haue talked in my
daies with some of your own crew,
and they haue held it for a thing
indifferent at the least, and haue not
bene halfe so hotte in it as you, and
therefore for the loue I beare you, I
would wishe you to haue some
regard of modestie and womanhood.
For yea faith when you haue saide
and <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: aud</comment> wrangled all that you can, it will
be found a most decent thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A decent thing? What talke you of
decencie? I tell you I hold it for more then a
<pagebreak id="17" />
Decent thing, even for a religious thing,
and a part of my bounden duetie, if it bee
(as you say) a Thankesgiving and a
service of God. But I pray you tell me, because
you wish me to haue a regard of modestie
and womanhood, haue you had any
information of any misbehaviour against me,
either in my speach, company, or cariage
of my selfe, if you haue, I shall thanke you
as my good kinsman to admonish me of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my trouth no: if it were not
for this odde pievishnesse of yours,
(whereby you trouble both your
selfe and your friendes more then
needs) I doe not (so God helpe me)
knowe or heare any thinge by you
that deserveth reproofe: and
therefore I am the willinger to pull you
out of it if I could.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It were well indeed if I could be pulled
from my faultes and you from your
swearing. But when your friend or kinsman
doeth any thing or refrayneth from anie
thing of conscience (as I may safelie
<pagebreak id="18" />
protest vnto you in this case I doe) Then the
way and meanes to set me straight (if I be
awry) is as I take it, the sacred Scripturs
and woord of God, which if you bring, or
any good reason out of it for proofe and
warrant of this your Churching, woe and
double woe to me if I subscribe not to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chaunculor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whop: here is a revell and adoe
with <font>Scriptures</font> , my kinswoman you
say, refrayneth of <font>Conscience</font> : But fro~
what doeth shee refrayne? forsooth
from Thankesgiving to God: Is not
this pretie stuffe, or is not this a
warme Conscience?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so: Deceyue not your selfe, nor
triumph not before the victorie, your
kinswoman thanketh God she hath bene better
taught then so. It is not from
Thankesgiuing to God (as you would haue it) that she
refrayneth of Conscience, but onely from
Iewish or Popish Purifying shadowed and
varnished over with a colour or shewe of
Thankesgiving. Thus shee tolde you once
before, and this shee telleth you againe and
<pagebreak id="19" />
againe. But I pray you let me aske you one
thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is not Thankesgiving a service of God?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: I hope no man doubtes of
that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What meane you then to harpe so much
vpon Decencie and modestie? Would you
haue vs serue God for Dece~cie? Sometimes
againe you saye that Churching is a thing
indifferent, a trifle, and a matter of
nothing, and yet you will needes haue it to be
a Thankesgiving to God. Howe can this
hang togeather then, that one &amp; the same
thing should be a matter of Dece~cie, of
indifferencie, or a trifle of no moment, &amp; yet
a seruice of God? Is the seruice of God come
to that passe amongst you now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I meane onely the Ceremonie of
it, as the Tyme, and th'Attyre, the
companie of women, the offerings,
and the feasting of neighbours and
friendes, to be as thinges indifferent
&amp; of no moment: But not the
<pagebreak id="20" />
prayers and thanksgiuing in the church,
that I holde to bee holy and not
indifferent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The trueth is yee holde yee can not tell
what amongst you: The Ceremonie stickes
so neare to your seruice, and your maner of
seruice is so sutable and agreeing with your
Ceremonie, that yee can not for your liues
sever the one from th'other. Take away
the Ceremonie, and there is no need of your
seruice that I see. Therefore you may doe
well in my conceite, to let them both
henceforward sleepe and surcease. For lett the
poore woman that hath escaped, bee never
so thankfull, or let her husband (as
maister of the familie) with his servantes and
friends giue God thankes never so 
earnestlie and Christianlie for that deliverance,
(and that euen then when the
remembrance of that mercie of God is freashest in
their memories) yet all this is nothinge to
you, nor of no reckoning, vnlesse the
Woman may haue her solemne Purification
at her monethes end, with her white vayle
<pagebreak id="21" />
or some such marke to be knowen by, which
is a manifest signe that albeit yee pretende
Thankesgiuing, yet in trueth yee care not
for it, so your Popish custome and
ceremonie of Purifying be not broken of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed it were fitt that ye women
should appoint the service and
ceremonies of the Church, and then
belike we should be wel &amp; 
handsomelie served. But I pray you tel me one
thing: What if for the peace of the
Church you should giue thankes
after this maner as in the book is
prescribed, what discredite, daunger or
inconvenience would ensue to you
vpon that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That is as much to say in good English,
as what if for the peace of the Church one
should make shew to giue thankes, when in
deed and in trueth there is no
Thankesgiving at all? were not that a plaine
mocking of God, a kinde of Hypocrisie, &amp;
Prophaning of the name &amp; Religion of God?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Trust me I thinke you are one of
<pagebreak id="22" />
the perversest creatures that ever
anie man dealt with. I speake not one
woord of a shew of Thankesgiving,
but of giving thankes in deede, and
looke now whither you be runne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why did you not speake of giving thanks
after the maner as the Booke prescribeth:
and that as I haue often tolde you, is but a
shew or shadow and no trueth. How am I
perverse then, when I ground vppon your
owne speaches? Now because you aske me
what inco~venience would ensue if I should
for anie respect vse this prete~ded
Thanksgiving, I will shew you (if you will giue me
leaue, &amp; that you will with patience heare
me) how I shall therein offende many and
sundrie wayes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As how I pray you for my
learning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Two wayes I haue alreadie told you of:
as first that in so doeing, I should therein
shewe my selfe either Iewish or Popish.
Secondlie, that in fayning to giue GOD <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: G O D</comment>
thankes, and to vse no one woord tending
<pagebreak id="23" />
to that ende, nor looking that way, is
nothing els but in a sort to mocke God to his
face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well what then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Thirdlie in so doeing, I shall not onely
nourish, foster and maintayne manie
superstitious and erroneous opinions in the
heartes of th'ignorant, and so strengthen
the simple in their false woorship, but also
fall into divers and sundrie most
daungerous absurdities: as namelie, first of all
that a woman after childbirth is vncleane
and vnholy, co~trary to th'Apostles wordes,
who teacheth vs that a Woman is
sanctified by bearing of children. For what may
Purifying I pray you presuppose, but some
former vncleannesse? Likewise, that a
woman is helde for the time as an
excommunicate person, and therefore most
solemnly be receyued agayn into the church.
For what may Churching presuppose but
some former excluding, shutting out and
cutting off?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These then I perceyue are some
<pagebreak id="24" />
of your supposed absurdities, haue
you any more of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well iest as you please, I haue more of
them then you or any man of your place ca~
with anie conscience answere or avoyde.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let vs heare them the~ I pray you,
and dispatch that we may know all 
our payne at once.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then I say further that in yeelding
to this Churchinge of yours, I should by
myne example condemne the primitiue
Church, and all the reformed Churches in
other Countreyes at this day, who vse no
such churchings: and withall iustifie and
approoue the papists, and all other
superstitious churches that ioine with them in the
vse of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A great piece of woorke, as if it
were such a matter to varie and
dissent a little from Calvin or Beza, I
tell you they may as well learne of
vs, as we of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who spake of Calvin or Beza? I
promise you I did not so much as think of the~.
<pagebreak id="25" />
I spake onely of the Primitiue and
Reformed churches. And albeit those men you
speak of were worthie instruments in Gods
church, &amp; such as we haue cause to thank
God for: yet the Lord I know might haue
spread foorth the light of his Gospell, and
reformed his Church, had they neuer
lived. But this is the manner of you all, you
broode of Chauncelors &amp; your Associates,
when you can saye nothing, then you fall
straight a girding &amp; railing on Calvin or
Beza, or some such worthie man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentle Cousen, be not angrie, I
meane you no hurt yea faith. What
other inconveniences or absurdities
doe you finde in this Churchinge,
speake your minde freelie, for I am
even bent to heare you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I should therein either my self abuse, or
yeeld to th'abusing of the woord of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so I pray you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I meane concerning the Psalme that is
there appointed for that purpose, vz. the
121 Psalme, which being left to the church
<pagebreak id="26" />
by the holy Ghost for comfort and
consolation in time of distresse, to applie it to
Thankesgiving, contrarie to the purpose
and meaning of the holy Ghost, must
needes (as I say) be a playne abusing and
prophaning of the woord. And if it bee
well considered of, it will be founde to bee
more fitte a great deale for a woman in
the time of her travel, agonie &amp; distresse,
then afterward when she is of strength &amp;
in good estate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea faith yea faith gossippe, I
doubt not if any of your precise
crew had sett down that Psalme for
that purpose, but you would haue
liked of it well enough for all the
cavills and quarrells you make
against it now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Thinke you so S=r=: Well I see that men
of your occupation may easilie bee
deceyved. But to deale plainlie and not to
dissemble with you, one especiall reason
among others that draweth mee to dislike
and refuse this Iuel of yours (I meane your
<pagebreak id="27" />
Churching) is, that in yeelding
therevnto, I should iustifie you and your fellowes
in your crooked and vnconscionable
proceedings, that is in vrging and pressing
your owne Traditions before the
Commaundements of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And bee these the pretie reasons
that mooue you thus to dislike the
custome and reverent vsage of our
Church? Now surely it sheweth
the waywardnes of your conceyte,
in that you preferre your owne will
before the peace of the Church,
which ought to be dearer vnto you
then thus to stand out &amp; endaunger
your selfe about such trifles, &amp;
matters of nothing, that are not woorth
a rush to speake of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No are? Then I say still, The more
shame for you to keepe such a revell and
adoe, for such things as your selfe confesse
are not woorth whisteling: and therin you
shew your selues to bee right Scribes and
Pharisees, that is, Hypocrites, tithing
<pagebreak id="28" />
mint and cumine, and leaving iudgment
and mercy, troubling the children of God
and those that ye ca~ not iustlie charge with
anie crime, for not obseruing your
Traditions &amp; beggerly Ceremonies, as Crossing,
Kneeling, Churching, &amp;c. and in the
meane season suffring the breakers of Gods
holy commandements (aske Mistres A. B.
els, &amp; a nombre of knowne Papistes,
Atheistes, Charmers, Blasphemers, Prophaners
of the Saboth, and such like) to goe scotfree
and vnpunished, as if your whole delight,
care and watchfulnesse were only for
th'obseruation of these bables and fruitlesse
Ceremonies of yours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O M=rs= <font>A. B.</font> I perceiue is a great mote
in your eye, wel I pray God that you
of the holy brotherhood that make
it so daintie, do (the best of you) liue
no worse then she doeth now, what
soever she hath bene heretofore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Amen say I, and better to. Indeed to doe
her no wrong as I heare no great
exclamation of her, for any notorious crime, so on
<pagebreak id="29" />
th'other side, wee that are her neighbours,
may safely acquite her of any great
co~mendation that shee hath for any holy and
religious course thereby to draw on others by
her example. Therfore praise her as much
as you list, when you haue done the best you
can, shee will bee founde but an ordinarie
woman: and the special thing that you can
co~mend in her (for any thing I see) is this:
that she is as quietly churched whe~ her time
comes, as any of the rest of her neighbours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would to God I could say so by
you to Cousen, condition I had
giuen twentie pound yea faith, &amp; then
you might haue eased vs of much of
this trouble.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You may doe one day, when you ca~ bring
me any sufficient reason and warrant for
it out of the Scripture. And if you will but
giue vs a tolleration and dispensation for
it till then, we will aske no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say well, I know your
meaning. But in good truth I muze that
the Peace of the Church doeth no
more mooue you.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You muze you say, that the peace of the
Church doeth no <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: uo</comment> more mooue me: And I
muze likewise what you would haue saide
if you had lived in the dayes of our Savi.
Christ, who defended his Disciples against
the Pharisees in a verier trifle &amp; of farre
lesse moment then this our refusall of your
Churching.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where I pray you, shew me that
for my learning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to the refusall of washing
of handes at meate? Is not that as small a 
matter as may be? And if you had bene
by at that time, when our Savior so boldly
defended his Disciples therein, it is like
enough you would haue coumpted him for
a verie Trifler, or some busie Troubler of
the Peace of the Church, that would keepe
such a doe for nothing. Sure by your
dealing with vs we can coniecture none other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush the Comparisons are not
alike.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Trulie even as like as may be. The
Pharisees founde fault with the Disciples for
<pagebreak id="31" />
breaking a Tradition of th'Elders, viz.
washing of handes at meate: and you find
fault with vs for breaking a much woorse
Traditio~ of yours. You aske vs often
whether Churching be not a Decent thing:
We aske you againe, whether washing bee
not both a Decent thing, a cleanly thing,
and a wholesome thing? Our Savior (you
see) defended his Disciples <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Disctples</comment> in the breach
of that Decencie of those Pharisees of that
age: and his woord doth warrant and
defende vs in the breach of this supposed
Decencie of your Pharisees of this age.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay then yea faith, if yee goe to
that, ye may take your selues by the
nose Mistres Cousen: For who the
Devill be the right Pharisees &amp;
Hypocrites if yee be not? Ye are so
demure, and ye make it so nice and so
holy amo~gst you, that by the Masse
a dogge would not dwell with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceyue if a dogge dwelt with you, if
you could but make him speake once, you 
would quicklie teach him to sweare.
<pagebreak id="32" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O that is all your grace amongst
you: you thinke your selues so pure
over other men, because you can a
litle bridle your selues from
swearing, and yet ye wil doe tenne times
woorse and make no bones at it. As
couetous, as spitefull, and malicious
yee are the most of you, as dogges.
I knowe one of your crew who
would not sweare for no good, and
vsed ordinarilie to pray with his me~
in his chamber, and yet beeing at a
Knights house, where hee had good
entertayneme~t, they prayed so
hartilie amongst them, that for
conscience sake they faire thwited me of a
valence of a bedde, and caried that
&amp; a piece of plate with them to the
value of twentie nobles at the least.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well though this peradventure may be
one of your legend stories, for any thing I
know, yet alow it to be true, what gette you
by that? one sinne you know excuseth not
another. These were hypocrites &amp; theeves,
<pagebreak id="33" />
therefore you to avoide this daunger, will
needes be swearers &amp; ruffeans: what
physike or policie call you that to avoid
Hypocrisie by plaine and open iniquitie?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why I doe not defend swearing
to bee good, woman: you doe not
heare me say so, I wish I could leaue
it with all my heart: It is but a
foolish custome and comes from me at
vnawares, and that many times whe~
I thinke no harme in the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Th'Apostle is against you in that: for
he sayeth, Out of the aboundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh: And our
Saviour saieth, That out of the heart comes
evill thoughts, and yet you can droppe vile
oathes amongst you (such is your skill) &amp;
thinke no harme. I must needes commend
you for this, by meanes whereof you haue
brought one notable thing to passe in our
Church, and I wish for my part yee were
Chronicled for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is that good gossippe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, That albeit there be many
<pagebreak id="34" />
Parishes amongest vs without a preaching
Minister, yet to mende the matter, there bee
few Dioces in the lande without a
swearing Chauncelor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is more the~ you know, good
huswife. But if it were so, I doe not
thinke but the woorst Chauncelor
amongst vs doeth more good then
many of your vpstart and busie
headed Preachers, pratlers I should say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, to let that rest as it is (for if
there be any thing amisse, wee should doe
wrong to looke for amendes from you) you
see evidentlie, that th'example which I
alleadged of our Saviour Christ in
reproving the Pharisees and defendinge his
Disciples in their refusall of that trifle of
washing of handes, is both a check to you,
for thus troubling of vs without cause, &amp;
a good warrant for vs to doe as we doe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe I see it? I promise you I must
gette me better spectacles then, then
ever I could yet light on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, if you doe not see it, I must needes
<pagebreak id="35" />
holde with you, that your spectacles are
starke naught in deede: But whether you
doe see it, or will not see it, it is and ought
to be a lesson of instruction to vs whom
you now thus trouble: That whensoeuer
anie Pharisaicall hypocrites doe strictlie
vrge and presse the keeping of their owne
traditions (bee they neuer so small and
trifling) with the neglect of the 
co~mandements of God, then <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: ihen</comment> it is our partes by 
all
lawfull &amp; holy meanes to bende our selues
against them, and not to yeelde to
th'observation of the least of them: much lesse
when the Traditions shalbe noisome,
hurtfull and superstitious, and derogatorie to
the glorie of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In good faith it was neuer merrie
world since these twatling women
became divines. I see I do but spend
time with you. And yet when you
haue sayd and done all that you can
for your life, it will be founde (as I
haue said) but a trifle that you stand
vppon, whereas the peace of the
<pagebreak id="36" />
Church is, or ought to bee to you a
matter of great moment, and a thing
that you ought daily to pray for, if
you haue (as you pretend) any
conscience with you, or regard of
brotherlie loue, with a desire to
mainteine vnitie, and to avoyde iarres &amp;
dissentions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> We are I confesse to pray for the peace
of Syon: For they shall prosper that loue
her. But what? Is the Church now become
a maynteiner of trifles? By your speaches
so often iterated and redoubled (for you
harpe still on that string) it should bee so:
and what indignitie were that? But in
deede as I haue told you the thing we stand
vpon (if it be rightlie examined) is not in 
that nature of indifferencie as you would
beare the world in hande it is, make of it
what you will either Thankesgiving or
Purifying: if it be Thankesgiving indeed,
it is my bounden duetie (say I) to performe
it, and a sinne to leaue it vndone: If it bee
Purifying, it is my bounden duetie to
<pagebreak id="37" />
avoyde it, and a sinne to practise it, because
it treadeth vnder foote the sufficiencie of
of <comment type="compiler">SO IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> the death and bloudsheading of IESVS
Christ, which is th'onlie purgation of my
sinne. So that turne it which way you will,
it is no light matter or trifle of small
regarde, as you would haue it, but a thinge
that one way or other greatly concerneth
the glorie of God, &amp; therein also you seeme
to me apparantlie to crosse, entangle &amp;
ensnare your selfe in your owne speaches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so I pray you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue tolde you alreadie, and that so
often, that I am halfe wearie of telling it.
But sure your minde is so on your
haulfpenie, that you neither remember what I
say, nor thinke on that you say your selfe.
Haue you not alwayes called this
Churching of yours, a Thankesgiving? and haue
you not laboured by the title of it in the
Booke, to defende it to be a Thankesgiuing
and no Purifying?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes that I haue, and so I say still.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then I saye for shame away with
<pagebreak id="38" />
this trifle and trifling of yours, and let vs
beare no more of that: For
Thankesgiving you know must needes be a part of
Gods woorship and seruice. And what an
impious &amp; vngodly thing were it to make
the holy woorship and seruice of God a
trifle, a matter of nothing, not worth a rush,
or a thing to bee done or not done at our
pleasures? I protest vnto you, if it were a
Thankesgiving in deede, that is such a
part of Gods woorship as he hath
comaunded and prescribed in his word, if I should
wilfully refuse to doe it, I were not
woorthie to bee coumpted a member of his
Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet still me thinkes the peace of
the Church doeth not poize and
prevaile with you as it should doe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Heere is a doe with the Peace of
the Church, and yet when ye haue all done,
a man may easilie see that though ye talke
of it never so much, yee vse it for the most
part but as a staulking horse amongst you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What meane you by that?
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, you know well enough, that the
staulkinge horse is not to blame for the
death of the foule, he doeth but onely
shadowe and stand before the fouler while hee
killeth him: Even so doe you. The Peace of
the Church (as you handle it) is a
notable vaile to shadowe all your deformities
and corruptions. If a good Minister doe
not yeelde to your lawlesse and 
vnconscionable subscription, or if he overskippe the
Crosse in Baptisme, Ring in Mariage, or
any such needles Ceremonie, then straight
you choke him with the peace of the
Church, the peace of the Church, and so
you doe now by vs for our refusall of
kneeling and Churching.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I pray you in good earnest,
why may not these and more then
these be endured and yeelded vnto
for the peace of the Church?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Peace of the Church were so deare
vnto you as you pretende and make shew
of, then would ye never for shame trouble
either Ministers or people for such odde
<pagebreak id="40" />
things as those that rather hinder then
further men in Religion. But your maner
is whe~ you speake of one thing to meane
another. You speake of the Peace of the
Church, but you meane still the peace of
your Hierarchie, the peace of your vnrulie
places and offices, the Peace of all your
Popish &amp; beggerlie Ceremonies, so they may
stande still vntouched, if yee Chauncelyers
and your Officials may be at quiet in your
roomes and iurisdictions: Litle (the Lord
knowes) doe yee care for the peace of the
Church: and that is seene not only by your
troubling of vs now without cause, but by
your ordinarie sile~cing, suspending &amp;
imprisoning of the best and holiest Preachers
for these trifles, and your countenancing
and allowing of dumme dogges, bee there
liues and behaviour neuer so shamefull.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O (my good kinswoman) we haue
heard enough of these matters long
agoe. These supposed quarrells haue
ben answered and answered againe,
you come to late yea faith with
<pagebreak id="41" />
your baskett of Apples now. What
a Devil should you medle with any
of these matters? It were much fitter
for such as you are, to medle with
your spindle and your wheele, and
soberlie to attend your trades &amp;
vocations, then thus in the pride of
your heartes to controlle your
betters, and to deale in Church causes
which belong not vnto you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I was I thank God busied in my vocatio~,
and so I might haue ben still, had not you
sommoned me the~ce by your officer. I know
right well Church causes belo~g not to such
as I am to deale in, neither doe I meddle
withall farther then by way of sute or
co~plainte to those that haue authoritie to
redresse. And if the Peace of the Church can
not mooue you to leaue cyting &amp; troubling
vs for trifles, whom otherwise you can not
charge with anie crime, never blame vs
if the bare sound and noyse of the Peace of
the Church doe not at al mooue vs to yeeld
to any of your trifling &amp; fruitles
Ceremonies against our consciences.
<pagebreak id="42" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well I am sorie you are so wilfull
yea faith: I perceiue I shall doe no
good of you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you you may easilie doe good of
me, and easilie draw me to the bent of your
bow, if you can produce and alleage vnto 
me but one only sentence and proofe out of
the scriptures of God.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Scripture? there is nothing with
you but Scriptures. No No. It is
even the pride of your heart, and
pievish singularity of your owne
conceyte that doth thus draw you.
Why doe you thinke no body seeth
anie thing but your selfe? or doe
you thinke there be not as sober &amp;
as honest wome~ as you Churched?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I perceyue you haue no Scripture
in the worlde to perswade mee with, your
onely scripture is the pride of my heart, the
Singularitie of my conceite, and I can not
tell what. But you aske me whether as
honest women as I be not churched? I aske
you againe, Whether as honest men as you
<pagebreak id="43" />
haue not denied Christ. Th'examples of
the godlie (you know) are not to be
followed but in godlines, whereas it is the
common guise of you and your generation to
make a solemne gathering and calling as
it were of the scabbes, imperfections and
bleamishes of the best men, and then to
lay them in our dish straight as a
choakepeare to vs: as for example, if ye find once
that Father Latimer and Ridley, or anie
such like reverend man, did weare square
cappe and surplus, why then there is no
remedie but this must bee proclaymed
straight as an authenticall warrant to all
the succeeding Ministers of the lande, that
they may boldlie and safelie yeelde to the
wearing of the like attire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I promise you, It is somthing
I tell you as light as you make of it.
Why is th'example of the godly
Martyrs nothing with you, and
your precise brotherhoode?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes it is something: but I doe not thinke
it should waigh more with vs then
<pagebreak id="44" />
th'example of Abraham, David, or Peter,
whose steppes you know we must not follow
when they slippe or goe awry. But will you
your selues I pray you (if a man may aske
it) stande to the iudgement, and bee
ruled by th'example of the godlie Martyrs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see no reason but wee may and
ought.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then downe falles to the grounde
straight your lawlesse oath of Inquisition,
wherewith yee so plague the Church now a
dayes, Iudge by Mai. Tindall els, Mai.
La~bart, and others that suffered for the
testimonie of Gods trueth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed Ma. Tindall and Ma.
Lambart were somewhat wilfull.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Iust, how els? Thus yee marshall the
Martyrs as it please your selues, when they
may serue your turne (be it in neuer so
great ignorance and weaknesse of theirs)
then their names, their pietie, and their
patience are layde before vs in great and
capitall letters, as paternes to follow. But
when they crosse you in any thing (bee the
<pagebreak id="45" />
same never so apparantlie warranted by
the Scriptures) then alas, they were but
men, yea and many times wilfull men, as
you doe now most iniuriouslie slaunder M=r=
Lambart and M=r= Tindall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But to leaue these circumstances
and by-matters, doe you thinke it is
a sinne to be Churched? speak your
conscience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> As I haue alreadie saied, if it be a sinne
to make shew of Thankesgiving, and yet
to giue no thankes at all: if it be a sinne to
abuse and misapplie the sacred Scriptures
of God to another ende and purpose then it
was giuen by the holy Ghost: if it bee a
sinne to strengthen and confirme the
Papist in his superstition, and the simple and
ignorant in their false &amp; erroneous
woorship: if all or any of these bee sinnes, then
doe I not see how your Churching (as it is
vsed amongst you) can escape the stampe
and brandmarke of sinne. And howsoever
it may bee to others, I doe well assure my
selfe it were a sinne and wickednes in mee,
<pagebreak id="46" />
because it is against the light of mine owne
conscience grounded vpo~ the reasons that
I haue alleaged vnto you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, but if you like not the
Psalme in the Booke whiche you
keepe such adoe at, and be so coy &amp;
conceyted, that for feare of abusing
it, forsooth you are loth to haue it
read to you, yet your Minister may
vse another if he will, and pray as he
thinkes good. So you would
decentlie &amp; womanly come to church
at your time, as other your
neighbours doe, by my trouth for my part
I could bee content to winke at
manie things, and shew you any favour
I could.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I perceyue you haue forgotten how
in the beginning when I asked you what
you meant by Churching, you tolde mee
that which was prescribed in the booke:
For law sayed you, would not warrant any
other. And are you come now to giue vs
libertie to vse another, so we would
<pagebreak id="47" />
quietlie obserue your Ceremonie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say well, Is this the thankes I
haue for my kindnesse and favor to
you, in that I am contented to saue
you from trouble and daunger, to
yeeld a litle to your weaknesse,
because you seeme to make co~science
of I can not tell what? In good faith
goship, you shall sitt till your heeles
ake before I offer you this favour
againe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but for all your chafing, I would
not haue you mistake me: What favour 
soeuer you shew me, I will not by Gods grace
be vnthankfull for it to my power. But I
vnderstood you that you gaue me euen now
free libertie to speake my minde, and that
you would willinglie heare what soeuer I
should say: and I tooke it and doe still take
it, that your Sommoning and sending for
me hither, was rather in your loue to
conferre with me and to satisfie me, then by
anie rigour of your law to punish me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my trouth you hitte it right:
<pagebreak id="48" />
For I was greatlie beholden to your
Father, and therefore I haue reason
to wishe you well, &amp; in that respect
I would gladlie doe you what good
I may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, then you continew this minde to
giue me your free warrant to speake in this
case what I thinke, and to cast all the
doubtes and make all th'obiections I can
against you, that so you may the better
resolue me in th'end?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How els? In the name of God,
speake your minde boldlie, neither
shall you offend me with any thing
you say: For I imagine you can say
nothing in this cause, but I haue
heard it alreadie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then, doeth not this (I pray you)
plainlie verifie and confirme that which I
told you of before when I likened you to the
Phariseis, vz. That your own foolish
Traditions and fruitlesse Ceremonies were
dearer to you and of more pretious accoumpt,
then the Sacred ordinance of God?
<pagebreak id="49" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so, I conceyue not that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No? Did not you say that for my sake
you would be co~tent to winck at the breach
of the Booke, and giue the Minister leaue
to vse other prayers, so I would be content
in any sort to be Churched, and keepe your
monethlie and manerlie Ceremonie?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why if I saied so, you are the more
beholden to me for that I doe not
meane (I tell you) to shew euery
bodie that favour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, howsoeuer I may in this regarde
thanke you for your loue to me, yet to deale
plainelie with you, I can not therein praise
you for your loue to the Church, nor never
shall till I see Preaching as much beholden
to you as Churching is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, doe you thinke I doe not
preferre the preaching of the worde
before anie other ceremonie of the
Church, be it neuer so
commendable?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It should appeare no by your dealinge
with our Minister.
<pagebreak id="50" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Minister! yea faith your
Minister hath no more witte then hee
occupies: He knowes not who is his
friend nor who is his foe. I would to
God he would be his owne friende
once. Stand sticking and mincing it
at these bables and trifles as he doth,
when he might be quiet in his
ministerie, if he would him selfe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So might wee poore women (whom you
thus trouble) be quiet too if we would bee
Churched: Our Minister you know is an
honest man of life, and a painfull Teacher
in his place, you can not charge him with
anie misdemeanour for your life. He
preacheth amongest vs with great fruite, and
hath wonne manie to the Gospell, and yet
for refusall of your lawlesse subscriptio~
beside the Statute, and for not wearing of
your surplus, &amp; not Crossing in Baptisme,
you neuer let him rest among you, but one
while you are doeing with him in your
Court: an other while the Pursevant from
the High Commission trounceth him: So
<pagebreak id="51" />
that yee make the poore man spend the
better part of his poore living in iaunceling
vp and down about the moon-shine in the
Town-dich.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, who is this long of, gentle
Cousen? Is not all this long of 
himselfe? There be as wise &amp; as learned
as he that yeeld to all this you speake
of, and more then this for the peace
of the Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But I pray you tell mee, Why may you
not be as kinde to him in his Ministerie &amp;
Preaching, as you offer to bee to me in this
Ceremonie of Churching? You saye you
preferre the preaching of the Gospell
before anie ceremonie what so ever: if you
meane in deede as you say, then for Gods
sake wincke a little at the breach of the
Booke in him as well as you are contented
to doe in me: let not your loue to me in
private bee greater then your loue to the
Church in publike. Looke a litle thorough
your fingers, and passe by as if you saw not
his refusall of the Crosse and Surplus.
<pagebreak id="52" />
That so we may enioye the meanes of our
salvation in peace. And if in anie case you
will yeelde to the breach of the Booke, let it
bee for the Gospell sake, and not for a
Ceremonie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In good faith, I can not tell what
to say to you, with beeing among
the perverse, you haue gotten as it
were a kinde of habite of
perversenesse. I had rather then any golde
your husband and you had neuer
planted your selues in that Parish:
why you were well enough before,
and well accoumpted of among
your neighbours, and it must needs
grieue many of your good friendes
to see you in these tunes now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I may truelie thanke God, as for many
other his mercies, so especially for this that
ever I came to this mans Ministery (whom
yee so trouble amongest you). I was indeed
a Protestant before, and thought well of
my selfe, and yet (if I shall not lie to you) I
had no more Religion then my horse. But
<pagebreak id="53" />
now I may truly say, that as my knowledge
is in some measure increased, so I neuer
made conscience of sinning and offending
God, till I came to the place where I nowe
dwell. All which as I must and doe
attribute to God, as th'Author and Founteine,
so to our Minister as the meanes and
instrument.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeede you haue made a very
woorthie increase, and mended the
matter wonderous wel. And all this
is for nothing els but because you
are come from Churching to No
Churching: what a wonderful cure
and charge your Minister hath
wrought in you. I beleeue he vseth
to Catechize you in nothing els but
only in Churching, you seeme to
be perfect in the point.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I would you could tell how to
discharge a good conscience in your places,
(any of you Chancelours) aswell as our
Minister doeth in his. His ordinarie
teaching is (thankes be to God) in matters of
<pagebreak id="54" />
more moment then you speake of, and if
you heard him once your selfe, I make no
question but you would say so. For mine
owne part I never hearde him speake
publikly of this particular custome of
churching in my life, further then might bee
gathered out of any generall doctrine of his.
Indeed I confesse I haue had private
conference with him about it, and hee hath
fullie satisfied me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what sort (I pray you) hath he
satisfied <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: fatisfied</comment> you? may I be so bold as to
craue a copie, or to be pertaker with
you of your ghostly fathers
resolutions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why you haue heard the most of them
alreadie, and I haue made knowne to you
at large the reasons that haue mooued mee
to shake off and abandon this foolishe and
superstitious custome of yours, wherewith
I had well hoped you had bene satisfied.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeede you haue told me many
prety things, but yet they bee such
as I haue hearde of before. Why,
<pagebreak id="55" />
they be the common reasons of you
all amongst you. I neuer had any of
you before me, but they haue
pleaded euen as you doe, or to the same
effecte.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The more saye I (vnder correction)
haue you to aunswere for, That havinge
had so manifest reasons layed before you so
long agoe, and the same so often iterated
and repeated vnto you, there is yet no
manner of relenting in you, but you doe still
persist and goe on in your course, in
troubling poore women without cause.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why you know my Lord Bushop
went farther with some of you not
farre from your quarters, and made
the proudest of them crouch, and
come on their knees, enforcing the~
to be Churched in despite of them,
and that two or three yeares after
they were layed. You would thinke
I deale hardlie with you, if I should
vse any of you so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now sure it was Bushoplike done of
<pagebreak id="56" />
him if he did so. But what warrant I pray
you had my Lord to make them crouch in
this maner as you speake of? Doeth the
Booke or any Law of the lande authorize
him to Church a woman 3 yeare after shee
is brought to bedde? shew me that I pray
you for my learning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, you haue nothing to doe
with that. Therefore it shall be good
for you Cousen (as I haue told you)
to medle with your own matters &amp;
to bee armed howe to aunswere for
your selfe, and not to deale in things
impertinent to your place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Content then, you giue me good counsell:
But remember your self, I pray you, that it
was you that brought in the Bushop &amp; not
I. I medled not with him till you spake of
him. But to desire to bee resolved in some
things of you is not I hope impertinent to
my place, is it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, god forbid, whatsoever you
desire to be satisfied in, be bold I pray
you to propound it, and I will thank
<pagebreak id="57" />
you and doe my best to resolue you
as farre foorth as lieth in me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then in this Thankesgiving you
speake of, who is it that you would haue
giue thankes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, the woman that hath bene
deliuered.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When is it that you would haue her giue
God thankes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When shee is strong and able to
goe to Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And not before? would you haue her
forgett her self, and be vnthankfull till then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chauncelor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, God forbid, I hope shee hath
more grace then so. But I speake of
publike tha~ksgiving &amp; not of private.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Woman.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, but the blessing you see is private,
and what reason is it then, or what
warrant, or what example haue you out of the
Scripture, that there should be an
ordinarie sett seruice in Publike for euery priuate
and perticular blessing? I would faine you
resolved me in that. If the Minister
bee in duetie bounde to giue God thankes
<pagebreak id="58" />
for euery private and particular bleshing,
why not then as well for my husbands fall
of his horse, as for my deliverance? I tell
you I holde my husbande a farre more
woorthy member of the Church then my
selfe, and therefore I see no reason why yee
should not cause him to bee Churched as
well as me, and so all others in our parishe
that haue escaped either drowning or
danger of death.
