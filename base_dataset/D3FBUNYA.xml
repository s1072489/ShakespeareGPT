 <head>THE 
PILGRIMS PROGRESS: 
IN THE SIMILITUDE OF A 
DREAM.</head> 

<nonSpeech>As I walk'd through 
the wilderness of this 
world, I lighted on a 
certain place, where 
was a Denn; And I 
laid me down in that
place to sleep: And as I slept I 
dreamed a Dream. I dreamed, and 
behold <font>I saw a Man cloathed with 
Raggs, standing in a certain place, 
with his face from his own House, a 
Book in his hand, and a great burden 
upon his back</font> . I looked, and saw him 
open the Book, and Read therein; 
and as he Read, he wept and
trembled:
and not being able longer to 
<pagebreak id="2" />
contain, he brake out with a 
lamentable cry; saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>what shall I do</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>I saw also that he looked this way, 
and that way, as if he would run; 
yet he stood still, because as I 
perceived, he could not tell which way 
to go. I looked then, and saw a Man 
named <font>Evangelist</font> coming to him, and 
asked,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Wherefore dost thou cry</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>He 
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I perceive, by the 
Book in my hand, that I am 
Condemned to die, and after that to 
come to Judgement; and I find that 
I am not willing to do the first, nor 
able to do the second.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said <font>Evangelist</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why not 
willing to die? since this life is 
attended with so many evils? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Man 
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I fear that this 
burden that is upon my back, will 
sinck me lower then the Grave, and 
I shall fall into <font>Tophet</font> . And Sir, if 
I be not fit to go to Prison, I am not 
fit (I am sure) to go to Judgement, 
and from thence to Execution; And 
the thoughts of these things make me 
cry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said <font>Evangelist</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> If this be 
thy condition, why standest thou still? 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>He answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I know not
<pagebreak id="3" />
whither to go. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he gave him 
a <font>Parchment-Roll</font> , and there was 
written within, <font>Fly from the wrath 
to come</font> .</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>The Man therefore Read it, and 
looking upon <font>Evangelist</font> very 
carefully; said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whither must I fly? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then 
said <font>Evangelist</font> , pointing with his 
finger over a very wide Field,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do 
you see yonder <font>Wicket-gate</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The 
Man said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> No. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said the other,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Do you see yonder shining light? 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>He said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I think I do. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said 
<font>Evangelist</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Keep that light in your eye, 
and go up directly thereto, so 
shalt thou see the Gate; at which
when thou knockest, it shall be told 
thee what thou shalt do. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>So I saw in my Dream, that the 
Man began to run; Now he had not 
run far from his own door, but his 
Wife and Children perceiving it, 
began to cry after him to return: but 
the Man put his fingers in his Ears, 
and ran on crying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Life, Life, 
Eternal Life: </dialogue><nonSpeech>so he looked not behind 
him, but fled towards the middle 
of the Plain.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Neighbours also came out to 
see him run, and as he ran, some 
<pagebreak id="4" />
mocked, others threatned; and some 
cried after him to return: Now 
among those that did so, there were 
two that were resolved to fetch him 
back by force: The name of the one 
was <font>Obstinate</font> , and the name of the 
other <font>Pliable</font> . Now by this time the 
Man was got a good distance from 
them; But however they were 
resolved to pursue him; which they did, 
and in little time they over-took him.
Then said the Man,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Neighbours, 
<font>Wherefore are you come</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>They said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> To 
perswade you to go back with us; </dialogue><nonSpeech>but 
he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> That can by no means be: 
You dwell, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> in the City of 
<font>Destruction</font> (the place also where I 
was born,) I see it to be so; and
dying there, sooner or later, you will 
sink lower then the Grave, into a 
place that burns with Fire and 
Brimstone; Be content good Neighbours, 
and go along with me.
   <font>What</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Obstinate</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>and leave 
our Friends and our comforts behind 
us</font> ! 
   Yes, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> , (for that was 
his name) </nonSpeech><dialogue> because that all is not 
worthy to be compared with a little 
of that that I am seeking to enjoy, 
<pagebreak id="5" />
and if you will go along with me, 
you shall fare as I my self; for there 
where I go, is enough, and to spare; 
Come away, and prove my words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Obst.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What are the things you seek, 
since you leave all the World to find them?</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I seek an <font>Inheritance, 
incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth 
not away</font> ; and it is laid up in Heaven, 
and fast there, to be bestowed at the 
time appointed, on them that 
diligently seek it. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ob.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Tush</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Obstinate</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>away with 
your Book; will you go back with us, or 
no</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not I, said the other; 
because I have laid my hand to the 
Plow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ob.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Come then, Neighbour</font> Pliable, 
<font>let us turn again, and go home 
without him; There is a Company of these 
Craz'd-headed Coxcombs, that when 
they take a fancy by the end, are wiser 
in their own eyes then seven men that 
can render a Reason</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pli.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then said <font>Pliable</font> , Don't 
revile; if what the good  <font>Christian</font> says 
is true, the things he looks after, are 
better then ours: my heart inclines 
to go with my Neighbour.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Obst.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What! more Fools still? be 
ruled by me and go back, who knows 
whither such a brain-sick fellow will 
lead you? go back, Go back, and be 
wise.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come with me Neighbour 
<font>Pliable</font> ; there are such things to be 
had which I spoke of, and many 
more Glories besides; If you believe 
not me, read here in this Book; and 
for the truth of what is exprest 
therein, behold all is confirmed by the 
blood of him that made it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well Neighbour</font> Obstinate </dialogue><nonSpeech> ( <font>said</font> 
Pliable) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I begin to come to a point; I 
intend to go along with this good man, 
and to cast in my lot with him: But 
my good Companion, do you know the 
way to this desired place</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am directed by a man whose 
name is <font>Evangelist</font> , to speed me to a 
little Gate that is before us, where 
we shall receive instruction about the 
way. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Come then good Neighbour, let 
us be going</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>then they went both together.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Obst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I will go back to my 
place, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Obstinate</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will be no 
Companion of such miss-led, 
fantastical Fellows.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now I saw in my Dream, that 
when <font>Obstinate</font> was gon back, 
<font>Christian</font> and <font>Pliable</font> went talking over 
the Plain; and thus they began their 
discourse,</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Christ.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come Neighbour <font>Pliable</font> , 
how do you do? I am glad you are 
perswaded to go along with me; and 
had even <font>Obstinate</font> himself, but felt 
what I have felt of the Powers and 
Terrours of what is yet unseen, he 
would not thus lightly have given us 
the back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pliable.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Come Neighbour</font> Christian, 
<font>since there is none but us two here, tell 
me now further, what the things are: 
and how to be enjoyed, whither we are 
going</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can better conceive of them 
with my Mind, then speak of them 
with my Tongue: But yet since you 
are desirous to know, I will read of 
them in my Book.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>And do you think that the words 
of your Book are certainly true?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes verily, for it was made 
by him that cannot lye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Plia:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well said; what things are 
they?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is an endless Kingdom
<pagebreak id="8" />
to be Inhabited, and everlasting life 
to be given us; that we may Inhabit 
that Kingdom for ever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well said; and what else?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There are Crowns of Glory 
to be given us; and Garments that 
will make us shine like the Sun in the 
Firmament of Heaven.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Plia.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This is excellent; And what 
else?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There shall be no more crying, 
nor sorrow; For he that is owner 
of the places, will wipe all tears 
from our eyes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>And what company shall we have 
there?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There we shall be with 
<font>Seraphims</font> , and <font>Cherubins</font> , Creatures that 
will dazle your eyes to look on them: 
There also you shall meet with 
thousands, and ten thousands that have 
gone before us to that place; none 
of them are hurtful, but loving, and 
holy: every one walking in the sight 
of God; and standing in his presence 
with acceptance for ever: In a 
word, there we shall see the Elders 
with their Golden Crowns: There we 
shall see the Holy Virgins with 
their Golden Harps. There we   
<pagebreak id="9" />
shall see Men that by the World 
were cut in pieces, burned in flames, 
eaten of Beasts, drownded in the 
Seas, for the love that they bare to 
the Lord of the place; all well, and 
cloathed with Immortality, as with 
a Garment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>The hearing of this is enough to 
ravish ones heart; but are these things 
to be enjoyed? how shall we get to be 
Sharers hereof?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lord, the Governour of 
that Countrey, hath Recorded <font>that</font> 
in this Book: The substance of 
which is, If we be truly willing to 
have it, he will bestow it upon us 
freely.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well, my good Companion, glad 
am I to hear of these things: Come on, 
let us mend our pace.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot go so fast as I would, 
by reason of this burden that is upon 
my back.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now I saw in my Dream, that just 
as they had ended this talk, they 
drew near to a very <font>Miry Slough</font> , that 
was in the midst of the Plain, and 
they being heedless, did both fall 
suddenly into the bogg. The name 
of the Slow was <font>Dispond</font> . Here 
<pagebreak id="10" />
therefore they wallowed for a time, 
being grieviously bedaubed with the 
dirt; And <font>Christian</font> , because of the 
burden that was on his back, began 
to sink in the Mire.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Pli.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Then said</font> Pliable,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Ah, 
Neighbour</font> Christian, <font>where are you now</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not 
know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pli.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>At that, <font>Pliable</font> began to be 
offended; and angerly, said to his 
Fellow.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Is this the happiness you have 
told me all this while of? if we have such 
ill speed at our first setting out, What 
may we expect, 'twixt this, and our 
Journeys end? May I get out again 
with my life, you shall possess the brave 
Country alone for me.</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech>And with that 
he gave a desperate struggle or two, 
and got out of the Mire, on that 
side of the Slow which was next to 
his own House: So away he went, 
and <font>Christian</font> saw him no more,</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Wherefore <font>Christian</font> was left to 
tumble in the Slow of <font>Dispond</font> alone, 
but still he endeavoured to struggle 
to that side of the Slow, that was still 
further from his own House, and 
next to the Wicket-gate; the which 
he did, but could not get out, 
<pagebreak id="11" />
because of the burden that was upon 
his back; But I beheld in my Dream, 
that a Man came to him, whose 
name was <font>Help</font> , and asked him, <font>What 
he did there</font> ?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I was 
directed this way by a Man called 
<font>Evangelist</font> ; who directed me also to 
yonder Gate, that I might escape 
the wrath to come: And as I was 
going thither, I fell in here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Help.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But why did you not look for 
the steps?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Fear</font> followed me so hard, that 
I fled the next way, and fell in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Help.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Give me thy hand</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>so he gave 
him his hand, and he drew him out, 
and set him upon sound ground, and 
bid him go on his way.</nonSpeech>  
   <nonSpeech>Then I stepped to him that pluckt 
him out; and said;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Wherefore, 
since over this place, is the way from 
the City of <font>Destruction</font> , to yonder 
Gate, is it, that <font>this</font> Plat is not 
mended, that poor Travellers might go 
thither with more security? </dialogue><nonSpeech>And he 
said unto me,</nonSpeech><dialogue> this <font>Miry slow</font> is such 
a place as cannot be mended: It is 
the descent whither the scum and 
filth that attends conviction for sin,
<pagebreak id="12" />
doth <comment type="compiler">CATCHWORD doth MISSING ON THIS PAGE IN SOURCE TEXT</comment>          
continually run, and therefore is it 
called the <font>Slough of Dispond</font> : for still as 
the sinner is awakened about his lost 
condition, there ariseth in his soul 
many fears, and doubts, and 
discouraging apprehensions, which all 
of them get together, and settle in 
this place: And this is the reason of 
the badness of this ground.
   It is not the pleasure of the King, 
that this place should remain so bad; 
his Labourers also, have by the 
direction of His Majesties Surveyors, 
been for above these sixteen hundred 
years, imploy'd about this patch of 
ground, if perhaps it might have 
been mended: yea, and to my 
knowledge, </dialogue><nonSpeech>saith he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Here</font> hath been 
swallowed up, at least Twenty 
thousand Cart Loads; Yea Millions of 
wholesom Instructions, that have at 
all seasons been brought from all 
places of the Kings Dominions; (and 
they that can tell, say, they are 
the best Materials to make good 
ground of the place;) If so be it might 
have been mended, but it is the <font>Slough 
of Dispond</font> still; and so will be, when 
they have done what they can.
   True, there are by the direction of 
<pagebreak id="13" />
the Law-giver, certain good and 
substantiall Steps, placed even 
through the very midst of this <font>Slough</font> ; 
but at such time as this place doth 
much spue out its filth, as it doth 
against change of weather, these steps 
are hardly seen; or if they be, Men 
through the diziness of their heads, 
step besides; and then they are 
bemired to purpose, notwithstanding 
the steps be there; but the ground is 
good when they are once got in at 
the Gate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now I saw in my Dream, that by 
this time <font>Pliable</font> was got home to 
his House again. So his Neighbours 
came to visit him; and some of them 
called him wise Man for coming 
back; and some called him Fool, for 
hazarding himself with <font>Christian</font> ; 
others again did mock at his 
Cowardliness; saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely since you 
began to venture, I would not have 
been so base to have given out for a 
few difficulties. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So <font>Pliable</font> sat 
sneaking among them. But at last he got 
more confidence, and then they all 
turned their tales, and began to 
deride poor <font>Christian</font> behind his back. 
And thus much concerning <font>Pliable</font> .</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="14" />
   <nonSpeech>By this time, <font>Christian</font> was got up 
to the Gate. Now over the Gate 
there was Written, <font>Knock and it shall 
be opened unto you</font> . He knocked 
therefore, more then once or twice.
 
Saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue>

<font>May I now enter here? will he within
Open to sorry me, though I have bin
An undeserving Rebel? then shall I,
Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high.</font>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>At last there came a grave Person to 
the Gate, named <font>Good-will</font> , who asked 
<font>Who was there? and whence he came? 
and what he would have</font> ?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a poor burdened sinner, 
I come from the City of <font>Destruction</font> , 
but am going to Mount <font>Zion</font> , that I 
may be delivered from the wrath to 
come; I would therefore, Sir, since 
I am informed that by this Gate is the 
way thither, know if you are <font>willing</font> 
to let me in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Good-Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am <font>willing</font> with all 
my heart, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he; and with that he 
opened the Gate.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>So when <font>Christian</font> was stepping in, 
the other gave him a pull; Then said 
<font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what means that? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The
<pagebreak id="15" />
other told him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> a little distance from 
this Gate, there is erected a strong 
Castle, of which <font>Belzebub</font> is the 
Captain: from thence both he, and 
them that are with him Shoot 
Arrows at those that come up to this 
Gate; if happily they may dye 
before they can enter in. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said 
<font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I rejoyce and tremble. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So 
when he was got in, the Man of the 
Gate asked him, Who directed him 
thither?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Evangelist</font> bid me come hither
and knock, (as I did;) And he said, that 
you, Sir, would tell me what I must 
do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Good Will.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>An open Door is set 
before thee, and no man can shut it.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I begin to reap the 
benefits of my hazzards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Good Will.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But how is it that you 
came alone?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because none of my 
Neighbours saw their danger as I saw mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Good Will.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Did any of them 
know of your coming?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Wife and Children 
saw me at the first, and called after 
me to turn again: Also some of my 
<pagebreak id="16" />
Neighbours stood crying, and calling 
after me to return; but I put my 
Fingers in mine Ears, and so came 
on my way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Good Will.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But did none of them 
follow you, to perswade you to go back?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, both <font>Obstinate</font> , and 
<font>Pliable</font> : But when they saw that they 
could not prevail, <font>Obstinate</font> went 
railing back; but <font>Pliable</font> came with 
me a little way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Good Will.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But why did he not come 
through?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We indeed came both together, 
until we came at the Slow of <font>Dispond</font> , 
into the which, we also suddenly fell. 
And then was my Neighbour <font>Pliable</font> 
discouraged, and would not 
adventure further. Wherefore getting out 
again, on that side next to his own 
House; he told me, I should possess 
the brave Countrey alone for him: 
So he went his way, and I came mine. 
<font>He</font> after <font>Obstinate</font> , and I to this Gate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Good Will.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Then said <font>Good Will</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Alas poor Man, is the Caelestial Glory 
of so small esteem with him, that he 
counteth it not worth running the 
hazards of a few difficulties to 
obtain it. Well, good <font>Christian</font> , come 
<pagebreak id="17" />
a little way with me, and I will teach 
thee about the way thou must go. 
Look before thee; dost thou see this 
narrow way? That is the way thou 
must go. It was cast up by the 
Patriarchs, Prophets, Christ, his Apostles; 
and it is as straight as a Rule can 
make it: This is the way thou must go.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Is there no 
turnings nor windings by which a 
Stranger may loose the way</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Good Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, there are many 
ways <font>Butt</font> down upon this; and they 
are Crooked, and Wide: But <font>thus</font> 
thou may'st distinguish the right from 
the wrong, <font>That</font> only being straight 
and narrow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then I saw in my Dream, That 
<font>Christian</font> asked him further, If he 
could not help him off with his 
burden that was upon his back; For as 
yet he had not got rid thereof, nor 
could he by any means get it off 
without help.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He told him;</nonSpeech><dialogue> As to the burden, be 
content to bear it, untill thou comest 
to the place of Deliverance; for 
there it will fall from thy back it self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Christian</font> began to gird up 
his loins, and to address himself to 
<pagebreak id="18" />

So the other told him, that 
by that he was gone some distance 
from the Gate, he would come at 
the House of the <font>Interpreter</font> ; at 
whose Door he should knock; and he 
would shew him excellent things. 
Then <font>Christian</font> took his leave of his 
Friend, and he again bid him, God 
speed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then he went on, till he came at 
the House of the <font>Interpreter</font> , where 
he knocked over, and over: at last 
one came to the Door, and asked 
<font>Who was there</font> ?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, here is a Travailer, who 
was bid by an acquaintance of the 
Good-man of this House, to call 
here for my profit: I would therefore 
speak with the Master of the House: 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>so he called for the Master of the 
House; who after a little time came 
to <font>Christian</font> , and asked him what he 
would have?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a 
Man that am come from the City of 
<font>Destruction</font> , and am going to the 
Mount <font>Zion</font> , and I was told by the 
Man that stands at the Gate, at the 
head of this way; that if I called 
here, you would shew me excellent  
<pagebreak id="19" />
things. Such as would be an help 
to me in my Journey.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Inter.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Then said the <font>Interpreter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Come in, I will shew thee that which 
will be profitable to thee. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So he 
commanded his Man to light the Candle, 
and bid <font>Christian</font> follow him; so he 
had him into a private Room, and 
bid his Man open a Door; the which 
when he had done, <font>Christian</font> saw a 
Picture of a very grave Person hang 
up against the Wall, and this was the 
fashion of it. <font>It had eyes lift up to 
Heaven, the best of Books in its hand, 
the Law of Truth was written upon its 
lips, the World was behind his back; it 
stood as if it Pleaded with Men, and a 
Crown of Gold did hang over its head.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Ch.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Then said</font> Christian,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>what means 
this</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Inter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Man whose Picture this 
is, is one of a thousand, he can 
beget Children, Travel in birth with 
Children, and Nurse them himself, 
when they are born. And whereas 
thou seest him with eyes lift up to 
Heaven, the best of Books in his hand, 
and the Law of Truth writ on his 
lips: it is to shew thee, that his work 
is to know, and unfold dark things 
<pagebreak id="20" />
to sinners; even as also thou seest 
him stand as if he Pleaded with 
Men: And whereas thou seest the 
World as cast behind him, and that a 
Crown hangs over his head; that is, 
to shew thee that slighting and 
despising the things that are present, 
for the love that he hath to his 
Masters service, he is sure in the World 
that comes next to have Glory for 
his Reward: Now, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the 
<font>Interpreter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have shewed thee this Picture, 
first, because the Man whose Picture 
this is, is the only Man, whom the 
Lord of the Place whither thou art 
going, hath Authorized, to be thy 
Guide in all difficult places thou 
mayest meet with in the way: 
wherefore take good heed to what I have 
shewed thee, and bear well in thy 
mind what thou hast seen; lest in thy 
Journey, thou meet with some that 
pretend to lead thee right, but their 
way goes down to death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he took him by the hand, and 
led him into a very large <font>Parlour</font> 
that was full of dust, because never 
swept; the which, after he had 
reviewed a little while, the <font>Interpreter</font> 
called for a man to <font>sweep</font> : Now 
<pagebreak id="21" />
when he began to sweep, the dust 
began so abundantly to fly about, that 
<font>Christian</font> had almost therewith been 
choaked: Then said the <font>Interpreter</font> to 
a <font>Damsel</font> that stood by,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Bring hither 
Water, and sprinkle the Room; </dialogue><nonSpeech>which 
when she had done, it was swept and 
cleansed with pleasure.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Ch.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Then said</font> Christian,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What means 
this</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>In.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>The <font>Interpreter</font> answered;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
this Parlor is the heart of a Man 
that was never sanctified by the sweet 
Grace of the Gospel: The <font>dust</font> , is 
his Original Sin, and inward 
Corruptions that have defiled the whole 
Man; He that began to sweep at 
first, is the Law; but She that brought 
water, and did sprinkle it, is the 
Gospel: Now, whereas thou sawest that 
so soon as the first began to sweep, the 
dust did so fly about that the 
Room by him could not be cleansed, 
but that thou wast almost choaked 
therewith. This is to shew thee, that 
the Law, instead of cleansing the 
heart (by its working) from sin, 
doth revive, put strength into, and 
increase it in the soul, as it doth 
<pagebreak id="22" />
discover and forbid it, but doth not 
give power to subdue.
   Again, as thou sawest the <font>Damsel</font> 
sprinkle the Room with Water, upon 
which it was cleansed with pleasure: 
This is to shew thee, that when the 
Gospel comes in the sweet and 
precious influences thereof to the heart, 
then I say, even as thou sawest the 
Damsel lay the dust by sprinkling 
the Floor with Water, so is sin 
vanquished and subdued, and the soul 
made clean, through the Faith of it; 
and consequently fit for the King of 
Glory to inhabit.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech>I saw moreover in my Dream, 
that the <font>Interpreter</font> took him by the 
hand, and had him into a little Room; 
where sat two little Children, each 
one in his Chair: The name of the 
eldest was <font>Passion</font> , and of the other 
<font>Patience</font> ; <font>Passion</font> seemed to be much 
discontent, but <font>Patience</font> was very 
quiet. Then <font>Christian</font> asked,</nonSpeech><dialogue> What 
is the reason of the discontent of 
<font>Passion</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The <font>Interpreter</font> answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
The Governour of them would have 
him stay for his best things till the 
beginning of the next year; but he 
will have all now: But <font>Patience</font> is 
willing to wait.
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then I saw that one came to 
<font>Passion</font> , and brought him a Bag of 
Treasure, and poured it down at his feet; 
the which he took up, and rejoyced 
therein; and withall, laughed 
<font>Patience</font> to scorn: But I beheld but a 
while, and he had lavished all 
away, and had nothing left him but 
Rags.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Ch.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Then said</font> Christian <font>to the</font> 
Interpreter,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Expound this matter more 
fully to me</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>In.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>So he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> These two Lads are 
Figures; <font>Passion</font> , of the Men of 
<font>this</font> World; and <font>Patience</font> , of the Men of 
<font>that</font> which is to come: For as here 
thou seest, <font>Passion will have all now</font> , 
this year; that is to say, in <font>this</font> World; 
<font>So</font> are the Men of this World: they 
must have all their good things now, 
they cannot stay till next <font>Year</font> ; that 
is, untill the <font>next</font> World, for their 
Portion of good. That Proverb, <font>A 
Bird in the Hand is worth two in the 
Bush</font> , is of more Authority with 
them, then are all the Divine 
Testimonies of the good of the World to 
come. But as thou sawest, that he 
had quickly lavished all away, and 
had presently left him, nothing but 
<pagebreak id="24" />
Raggs; So will it be with all such 
Men at the end of this World. 
  </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ch.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Then said</font> Christian,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Now I see 
that</font> Patience <font>has the best Wisdom; 
and that upon many accounts. 1. 
Because he stays for the best things. 2. And 
also because he will have the Glory of</font> 
His, <font>when the other hath nothing but 
Raggs</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>In.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, you may add another; 
to wit, The glory of the <font>next</font> World 
will never wear out; but these are 
suddenly gone. Therefore <font>Passion</font> had 
not so much reason to laugh at 
<font>Patience</font> , because he had his good things 
first, as <font>Patience</font> will have to laugh 
at <font>Passion</font> , because he had his best 
things <font>last</font> ; for  <font>first</font> must give place to 
<font>last</font> , because <font>last</font> must have his time 
to come, but <font>last</font> gives place to 
<font>nothing</font> ; for there is not another to 
succeed: he therefore that hath his 
Portion <font>first</font> , must needs have a time to 
spend it; but he that has his Portion 
<font>last</font> , must have it lastingly. 
Therefore it is said of <font>Dives, In thy 
life-time thou hadest, or receivedest thy 
good things, and likewise</font> Lazarus <font>evil 
things; But now he is comforted, and 
thou art tormented</font> .
<pagebreak id="25" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ch.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Then I perceive, 'tis not best to 
covet things that are</font> now; <font>but to wait 
for things to</font> come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>In.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say the Truth; <font>For the 
things that are seen, are</font> Temporal; <font>but 
the things that are not seen, are</font> Eternal: 
But though this be so; yet since things 
present, and our fleshly appetite, <font>are 
such near Neighbours one to another</font> ; 
and again, because things to come, 
and carnal sense, are such strangers 
one to another: therefore it is, that 
the first of these so suddenly fall into 
<font>amity</font> , and that <font>distance</font> is so 
continued between the second. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then I saw in my Dream, that the 
<font>Interpreter</font> took <font>Christian</font> by the 
hand, and led him into a place, 
where was a Fire burning against a 
Wall, and one standing by it always, 
casting much Water upon it to quench 
it: Yet did the Fire burn higher and 
hotter.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then said</font> Christian,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What means 
this</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The <font>Interpreter</font> answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> This 
fire is the work of Grace that is 
wrought in the heart; he that casts 
Water upon it, to extinguish and put 
it out, is the <font>Devil</font> : but in that thou  
<pagebreak id="26" />
seest the fire notwithstanding burn 
higher and hotter, thou shalt also 
see the reason of that: </dialogue><nonSpeech>So he had him 
about to the back side of the Wall, 
where he saw a Man with a Vessel of 
Oyl in his hand, of the which he did 
also continually cast, but secretly, 
into the fire. Then said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What 
means this</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The <font>Interpreter</font> 
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is <font>Christ</font> , who continually 
with the Oyl of his Grace, maintains 
the work already begun in the heart; 
By the means of which, 
notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the 
souls of his People prove gracious 
still. And in that thou sawest, that 
the Man stood behind the Wall to 
maintain the fire; this is to teach 
thee, that it is hard for the tempted 
to see how this work of Grace is 
maintained in the soul.

<pagebreak id="28" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then 
<font>Christian</font> smiled, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I think verily I 
know the meaning of this.
   Now, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let me go 
hence: Nay stay </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said the 
<font>Interpreter</font> ,) </nonSpeech><dialogue> till I have shewed thee a little 
more, and after that thou shalt go 
on thy way. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So he took him by the 
hand again, and led him into a very 
dark Room, where there sat a Man 
in an Iron Cage.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Now the Man, to look on, 
seemed very sad: he sat with his eyes
looking down to the ground, his hands 
folded together; and he sighed as if 
he would break his heart. Then said 
<font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> What means this? </dialogue><nonSpeech>At which 
the <font>Interpreter</font> bid him talk with the 
Man.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Then said <font>Christian</font> to the  
<pagebreak id="29" />
Man,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What art thou</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Man 
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am what I was not once</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What wast thou once?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>The <font>Man</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I was once 
a fair and flourishing Professor, both 
in mine own eyes, and also in the 
eyes of others: I once was, as I 
thought, fair for the Coelestial City, 
and had then even joy at the thoughts 
that I should get thither. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well, but what art thou now?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am <font>now</font> a Man of Despair, 
and am shut up in it, as in this Iron 
Cage. I cannot get out; O <font>now</font> I 
cannot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But how camest thou in this 
condition?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I left off to watch, and be 
sober; I laid the reins upon the neck 
of my lusts; I sinned against the light 
of the Word, and the goodness of 
God: I have grieved the Spirit, and 
he is gone; I tempted the Devil, and 
he is come to me; I have provoked 
God to anger, and he has left me; I 
have so hardened my heart, that I 
cannot repent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said <font>Christian</font> to the 
<font>Interpreter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> But is there no hopes for such a 
Man as this? Ask him, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the  
<pagebreak id="30" />
<font>Interpreter</font> ?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> pray
Sir, do you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Inter.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Then said the <font>Interpreter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Is there no hope but you must be kept in 
this Iron Cage of Despair</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, none at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Inter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Why? the Son of the Blessed 
is very pitiful.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have Crucified him to my 
self, a fresh. I have despised his 
Person, I have despised his Righteousness, 
I have counted his Blood an unholy 
thing, I have done despite to the 
Spirit of Grace: Therefore I have 
shut my self out of all the Promises; 
and there now remains to me nothing 
but threatnings, dreadful threatnings, 
faithful threatnings of certain 
Judgement, which shall devour me as an 
Adversary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Inter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>For what did you bring your 
self into this condition?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For the Lusts, Pleasures, and 
Profits of this World; in the 
injoyment of which, I did then promise 
my self much delight: but now even 
every one of those things also bite 
me, and gnaw me like a burning 
worm.
<pagebreak id="31" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Inter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But canst thou not now repent 
and turn?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God hath denied me 
repentance; his Word gives me no 
encouragement to believe; yea, himself 
hath shut me up in this Iron Cage; 
nor can all the men in the World let 
me out. O Eternity! Eternity! how 
shall I grapple with the misery that I 
must meet with in Eternity!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Inter.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Then said the <font>Interpreter</font> to 
<font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Let this mans misery be 
remembred by thee, and be an 
everlasting caution to thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> this is 
fearful; God help me to watch and 
be sober; and to pray, that I may 
shun the causes of this mans misery. 
Sir, is it not time for me to go on my 
way now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Inter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tarry till I shall shew thee 
one thing more, and then thou shalt 
go on thy way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>So he took <font>Christian</font> by the hand 
again, and led him into a Chamber, 
where there was one a rising out of 
Bed; and as he put on his Rayment, 
he shook and trembled. Then said 
<font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why doth this Man thus 
tremble? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The <font>Interpreter</font> then bid  
<pagebreak id="32" />
him tell to <font>Christian</font> the reason of his 
so doing, So he began, and said.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This 
night as I was in my sleep, I Dreamed, 
and behold the Heavens grew 
exceeding black; also it thundred and 
lightned in most fearful wise, that it 
put me into an Agony. So I looked 
up in my Dream, and saw the Clouds 
rack at an unusual rate; upon which 
I heard a great sound of a Trumpet, 
and saw also a Man sit upon a Cloud, 
attended with the thousands of 
Heaven; they were all in flaming fire, also 
the Heavens was on a burning flame. 
I heard then a voice, saying, <font>Arise ye 
Dead, and come to Judgement</font> ; and 
with that, the Rocks rent, the Graves 
opened, &amp; the Dead that were 
therein, came forth; some of them were 
exceeding glad, and looked upward; 
and some sought to hide themselves 
under the Mountains: Then I saw 
the Man that sat upon the Cloud, 
open the Book; and bid the World 
draw near. Yet there was by reason 
of a Fiery flame that issued out and 
came from before him, a convenient 
distance betwixt him and them, as 
betwixt the Judge and the Prisoners 
at the Bar. I heard it also proclaimed 
<pagebreak id="33" /> 
to them that attended on the Man 
that sat on the Cloud; <font>Gather 
together the Tares, the Chaff, and Stubble, 
and cast them into the burning Lake</font> ; 
and with that, the Bottomless pit 
opened, just whereabout I stood; out 
of the mouth of which there came in 
an abundant manner Smoak, and 
Coals of fire, with hideous noises. It 
was also said to the same persons; 
<font>Gather my Wheat into my Garner</font> . 
And with that I saw many catch't up 
and carried away into the Clouds, 
but I was left behind. I also sought 
to hide my self, but I could not; for 
the Man that sat upon the Cloud, still 
kept his eye upon me: my sins also 
came into mind, and my Conscience 
did accuse me on every side. Upon 
this I awaked from my sleep.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But what was it that made you 
so fraid of this sight?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Man.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why I thought that the day 
of Judgement was come, and that I 
was not ready for it: but this frighted 
me most, that the Angels gathered 
up several, and left me behind; also 
the pit of Hell opened her mouth 
just where I stood: my Conscience too 
within afflicted me; and as I thought, 
<pagebreak id="34" />
the Judge had always his eye upon 
me, shewing indignation in his 
countenance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said the <font>Interpreter</font> to 
<font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hast thou considered all these 
things</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chri.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and they put me in 
<font>hope</font> and <font>fear</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Inter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, keep all things so in thy 
mind, that they may be as a <font>Goad</font> in 
thy sides, to prick thee forward in the 
way thou must go. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Christian</font> 
began to gird up his loins, and to 
address himself to his Journey. Then 
said the <font>Interpreter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Comforter 
be always with thee good <font>Christian</font> , 
to guide thee in the way that leads 
to the City. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>So <font>Christian</font> went on his way, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 

<font>Here I have seen things rare, and 
profitable; 
Things pleasant, dreadful, things to 
make me stable 
In what I have began to take in hand: 
Then let me think on them, and 
understand 
Wherefore they shewed me was, and let 
me be 
Thankful, O good Interpreter, to thee.</font>
<pagebreak id="35" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now I saw in my Dream, that 
the high way up which <font>Christian</font> was 
to go, was fenced on either side with 
a Wall, and that Wall is called 
<font>Salvation</font> . Up this way therefore did 
burdened <font>Christian</font> run, but not 
without great difficulty, because of the 
load on his back.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He ran thus till he came at a place 
somewhat ascending; and upon that 
place stood a <font>Cross</font> , and a little 
below in the bottom, a Sepulcher. So 
I saw in my Dream, that just as 
<font>Christian</font> came up with the <font>Cross</font> , his 
burden loosed from off his Shoulders, 
and fell from off his back; and 
began to tumble, and so continued to 
do, till it came to the mouth of the 
Sepulcher, where it fell in, and I saw 
it no more.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Then was <font>Christian</font> glad and 
lightsom, and said with a merry heart,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
<font>He hath given me rest, by his sorrow; 
and life, by his death</font> . <omission type="line" />

<comment type="compiler">CHRISTIAN MEETS THREE SHINING ONES.</comment>

<pagebreak id="37" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>I saw then in my Dream that 
he went on thus, even untill he 
came at a bottom, where he saw, 
a little out of the way, three Men 
fast asleep with Fetters upon their 
heels. The name of the one was 
<font>Simple</font> , another <font>Sloth</font> , and the third 
<font>Presumption</font> .</nonSpeech>   
   <nonSpeech> <font>Christian</font> then seeing them lye in 
this case, went to them, if 
peradventure he might awake them. And 
cryed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are like them that sleep 
on the top of a Mast, for the dead 
Sea is under you, a Gulf that hath 
no bottom: Awake therefore and 
come away, be willing also, and I 
will help you off with your Irons. </dialogue><nonSpeech>He 
also told them,</nonSpeech><dialogue> If he that goeth about 
like a roaring Lion comes by, you 
will certainly become a prey to his 
teeth. </dialogue><nonSpeech>With that they lookt upon 
him, and began to reply in this sort: 
<font>Simple</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I see no danger</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sloth</font> 
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Yet a little more sleep</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>and 
<font>Presumption</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Every Fatt must stand 
upon his own bottom, what is the 
answer else that I should give thee</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>And so 
<font>they</font> lay down to sleep again, and 
<font>Christian</font> went on his way.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="38" />
   <nonSpeech>Yet was he troubled to think, That 
men in that danger should so little 
esteem the kindness of him that so 
freely offered to help them; both by 
awakening of them, counselling of 
them, and proffering to help them off 
with their Irons. And as he was 
troubled there-about, he espied two 
Men come tumbling over the Wall, 
on the left hand of the narrow way; 
and they made up a pace to him. The 
name of the one was <font>Formalist</font> , and 
the name of the other <font>Hypocrisie</font> . So, 
as I said, they drew up unto him, 
who thus entered with them into 
discourse.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Gentlemen, Whence came you,

other way, the same is a thief and a 
robber?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Form.</font> and <font>Hyp.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>They said, That 
to go to the Gate for entrance, was 
<pagebreak id="39" />
by all their Countrey-men counted 
too far about; and that therefore 
their usual way was to make a short 
cut of it, and to climb over as they 
had done.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But will it not be counted a 
Trespass, against the Lord of the City 
whither we are bound, thus to violate 
his revealed will?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Form.</font> and <font>Hyp.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>They told him, 
That as for that, he needed not to 
trouble his head thereabout: for what 
they did, they had custom for; and 
could produce, if need were, 
Testimony that would witness it, for 
more then a thousand years.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Chr.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>said</font> Christian,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Will your 
Practice <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Practce</comment> stand a Trial at Law</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Form.</font> &amp; <font>Hyp.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>They told him, That 
Custom, it being of so long a 
standing, as above a thousand years, 
would doubtless now be admitted as 
a thing legal, by any Impartial Judge.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
And besides, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> so be we get 
into the way, what's matter which 
way we get in; if we are in, we are 
in: thou art but in the way, who, 
as we perceive, came in at the Gate; 
and we are also in the way, that came 
<pagebreak id="40" />
tumbling over the wall: Wherein now 
is thy condition better then ours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I walk by the Rule of my 
Master, you walk by the rude 
working of your fancies. You are counted 
thieves already, by the Lord of the 
way; therefore I doubt you will 
not be found true men at the end of 
the way. You come in by your selves 
without his direction; and shall go 
out by your selves without his mercy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>To this they made him but little 
answer; only they bid him look to 
himself. Then I saw that they went 
on every man in his way, without 
much conference one with another; 
save that these two men told 
<font>Christian</font> , That, as to <font>Laws and Ordinances</font> , 
they doubted not but they should as 
conscientiously do them as he.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Therefore </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> We see not wherein 
thou differest from us, but by the 
Coat that is on thy back, which was, 
as we tro, given thee by some of thy 
Neighbours, to hide the shame of 
thy nakedness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By Laws and Ordinances, 
you will not be saved, since you came 
not in by the door. And as for this 
Coat that is on my back, it was given 
<pagebreak id="41" />
me by the Lord of the place whither 
I go; and that, as you say, to cover 
my nakedness with. And I take it as 
a token of his kindness to me, for I 
had nothing but rags before. And 
besides, thus I comfort my self as I 
go: Surely, think I, when I come to 
the Gate of the City, the Lord 
thereof will know me for good, since I 
have his Coat on my back; a Coat 
that he gave me freely in the day that 
he stript me of my rags. I have 
moreover a mark in my forehead, of 
which perhaps you have taken no 
notice, which one of my Lords most 
intimate Associates, fixed there in the 
day that my burden fell off my 
shoulders. I will tell you moreover, 
that I had then given me a Roll sealed 
to comfort me by reading, as I go in 
the way; I was also bid to give it in 
at the Coelestial Gate, in token of 
my certain going in after it: all 
which things I doubt you want, and 
want them, because you came not 
in at the Gate.
 
<comment type="compiler">CHRISTIAN GOES UP THE HILL CALLED DIFFICULTY.</comment>
  
<pagebreak id="44" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now when he was got up to the 
top of the Hill, there came two Men 
running against him amain; the name 
of the one was <font>Timorus</font> , and the name 
of the other <font>Mistrust</font> . To whom 
<font>Christian</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirs, what's the matter 
you run the wrong way? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Timorus</font> 
answered, That they were going to 
the City of <font>Zion</font> , and had got up 
that <font>difficult</font> place;</nonSpeech><dialogue> but, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> the 
further we go, the more danger we 
<pagebreak id="45" />
meet with, wherefore we turned, and 
are going back again.
   Yes, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Mistrust</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for just before 
us lye a couple of Lyons in the 
way, whether sleeping or 
wakeing we know not; and we could not 
think, if we came within reach, but 
they would presently pull us in pieces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Then said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> You make 
me afraid, but whither shall I fly to 
be safe? If I go back to mine own 
Countrey, <font>That</font> is prepared for Fire 
and Brimstone; and I shall certainly 
perish there. If I can get to the 
Coelestial City, I am sure to be in safety 
there. I must venture: To go back 
is nothing but death, to go forward 
is fear of death, and life everlasting 
beyond it. I will yet go forward. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So 
<font>Mistrust</font> and <font>Timorus</font> ran down 
the Hill; and <font>Christian</font> went on his 
way.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />

<comment type="compiler">CHRISTIAN LOSES HIS ROLL, AND HAS TO GO BACK TO FIND IT.</comment>

<pagebreak id="48" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>Thus he 
went on his way, but while he was 
<pagebreak id="49" />
thus bewayling his unhappy 
miscarriage, he lift up his eyes, and behold 
there was a very stately Palace 
before him, the name whereof was 
<font>Beautiful</font> , and it stood just by the 
High-way side.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>So I saw in my Dream, that he 
made haste and went forward, that if 
possible he might get Lodging there; 
now before he had gone far, he 
entered into a very narrow passage, 
which was about a furlong off of the 
Porters Lodge, and looking very 
narrowly before him as he went, he 
espied two Lions in the way.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>thought he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I see the dangers that 
<font>Mistrust</font> and <font>Timorus</font> , were driven 
back by. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (The Lions were Chained, 
but he saw not the Chains) Then he 
was afraid, and thought also himself 
to go back after them, for he thought 
nothing but death was before him: 
But the <font>Porter</font> at the Lodge, whose 
Name is <font>Watchful</font> , perceiving that 
<font>Christian</font> made a halt, as if he would 
go back, cried unto him, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Is thy strength so small? fear not the 
Lions, for they are Chained: and are 
placed there for trial of faith where it 
is; and for discovery of those that 
<pagebreak id="50" />
have none: keep in the midst of the 
Path, and no hurt shall come unto 
thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then I saw that he went on, 
trembling for fear of the Lions; but 
taking good heed to the directions of 
the <font>Porter</font> ; he heard them roar, but 
they did him no harm. Then he clapt 
his hands, and went on, till he came 
and stood before the Gate where the 
<font>Porter</font> was. Then said <font>Christian</font> to 
the <font>Porter</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, What house is this? 
and may I lodge here to night? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The 
<font>Porter</font> answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> This House was 
built by the Lord of the Hill: and he 
built it for the relief and security of 
Pilgrims. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The <font>Porter</font> also asked 
whence he was, and whither he was
going?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am come from the City of 
<font>Destruction</font> , and am going to Mount 
<font>Zion</font> , but because the Sun is now set, 
I desire, if I may, to lodge here to 
night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Por.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What is your name?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My name is now <font>Christian</font> ; 
but my name at the first was <font>Graceless</font> : 
I came of the Race of <font>Japhet</font> , whom 
God will perswade to dwell in the 
Tents of <font>Shem</font> .
<pagebreak id="51" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Por.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But how doth it happen that you 
come so late, the Sun is set?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had been here sooner, but 
that, wretched man that I am! I slept 
in the <font>Arbour</font> that stands on the 
Hill side; nay, I had notwithstanding 
that, been here much sooner, but 
that in my sleep I lost my Evidence, 
and came without it to the brow of 
the Hill; and then feeling for it, and 
finding it not, I was forced with 
sorrow of heart, to go back to the place 
where I slept my sleep, where I found 
it, and now I am come. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Por.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I will call out one of 
the Virgins of this place, who will, 
if she likes your talk, bring you in
to the rest of the Family, according 
to the Rules of the House. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So 
<font>Watchful</font> the <font>Porter</font> rang a Bell, at the 
sound of which, came out at the 
door of the House, a Grave and 
Beautiful Damsel, named <font>Discretion</font> , and 
asked why she was called.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The <font>Porter</font> answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> This Man is 
in a Journey from the City of 
<font>Destruction</font> to Mount <font>Zion</font> , but being 
weary, and benighted, he asked me 
if he might lodge here to night; so I 
told him I would call for thee, who  
<pagebreak id="52" />
after discourse had with him, mayest 
do as seemeth thee good, even 
according to the Law of the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then she asked him whence he 
was, and whither he was going, and 
he told her. She asked him also, how 
he got into the way, and he told her;
Then she asked him, What he had 
seen, and met with in the way, and 
he told her; and last, she asked his 
name, so he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is <font>Christian</font> ; and 
I have so much the more a desire to 
lodge here to night, because, by 
what I perceive, this place was 
built by the Lord of the Hill, for the 
relief and security of Pilgrims. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So 
she smiled, but the water stood in 
her eyes: And after a little pause, 
she said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will call forth two or three 
more of the Family. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So she ran to 
the door, and called out <font>Prudence</font> , 
<font>Piety</font> , and <font>Charity</font> , who after a little 
more discourse with him, had him 
in to the Family; and many of 
them meeting him at the threshold 
of the House, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Come in thou 
blessed of the Lord; this House was 
built by the Lord of the Hill, on 
purpose to entertain such Pilgrims in. 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he bowed his head, and  
<pagebreak id="53" />
followed them into the House. So when he 
was come in, and set down, they 
gave him somthing to drink; and 
consented together that until supper 
was ready, some one or two of 
them should have some particular 
discourse with <font>Christian</font> , for the best 
improvement of time: and they 
appointed <font>Piety</font> , and <font>Prudence</font> to 
discourse with him; and thus they 
began.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Come good</font> Christian, <font>since 
we have been so loving to you, to receive 
you into our House this night; let us, 
if perhaps we may better our selves 
thereby, talk with you of all things 
that have happened to you in your 
Pilgrimage</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With a very good will, and I 
am glad that you are so well disposed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What moved you at first to 
betake your self to a Pilgrims life?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was driven out of my 
Native Countrey, by a dreadful sound 
that was in mine ears, to wit, That 
unavoidable destruction did attend 
me, if I abode in that place where I 
was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But how did it happen that 
you came out of your Countrey this way?</font>
<pagebreak id="54" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was as God would have it, 
for when I was under the fears of 
destruction, I did not know whither 
to go; but by chance there came a 
Man, even to me, (as I was 
trembling and weeping) whose name is 
<font>Evangelist</font> , and he directed me to the 
Wicket-Gate, which else I should 
never have found; and so set me into 
the way that hath led me directly to 
this House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But did you not come by the 
House of the Interpreter?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and did see such things 
there, the remembrance of which 
will stick by me as long as I live; 
specially three things, <font>to wit</font> , How 
Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains 
his work of Grace in the heart; how 
the Man had sinned himself quite out 
of hopes of Gods mercy; and also 
the Dream of him that thought in 
his sleep the day of Judgement was 
come. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Why? Did you hear him tell 
his Dream?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and a dreadful one it 
was. I thought it made my heart ake 
as he was telling of it, but yet I am 
glad I heard it.
<pagebreak id="55" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Was that all that you saw at 
the House of the Interpreter?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he took me and had 
me where he shewed me a stately 
Palace, and how the People were 
clad in Gold that were in it; and 
how there came a venturous Man, 
and cut his way through the armed 
men that stood in the door to keep 
him out; and how he was bid to come 
in, and win eternal Glory. Methought 
those things did ravish my heart; I 
could have staid at that good Mans 
house a twelve-month, but that I 
knew I had further to go. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>And what saw you else in the 
way?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Saw! Why I went but a little 
further, and I saw one, as I thought 
in my mind, hang bleeding upon the 
Tree; and the very sight of him made 
my burden fall off my back (for I 
groaned under a weary burden) but 
then it fell down from off me. 'Twas 
a strange thing to me, for I never saw 
such a thing before: Yea, and while 
I stood looking up, (for then I could 
not forbear looking) three shining 
ones came to me: one of them 
testified that my sins were forgiven me; 
<pagebreak id="56" />
another stript me of my Rags, and 
gave me this Broidred Coat which you 
see; and the third set the mark which 
you see, in my forehead, and gave 
me this sealed Roll (and with that 
he plucked it out of his bosom.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Piety.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>But you saw more then this, 
did you not?</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The things that I have told 
you were the best: yet some other 
small matters I saw, as namely I saw 
three Men, <font>Simple</font> , <font>Sloth</font> , and 
<font>Presumption</font> , lye a sleep a little out of 
the way as I came, with Irons upon 
their heels; but do you think I could 
awake them! I also saw <font>Formalist</font> and 
<font>Hypocrisie</font> come tumbling over the 
wall, to go, as they pretended, to 
<font>Sion</font> , but they were quickly lost; 
even as I my self did tell them, but they 
would not believe: but, above all, I 
found it <font>hard</font> work to get up this Hill, 
and as <font>hard</font> to come by the Lions 
mouths; and truly if it had not been 
for the good Man, the Porter that 
stands at the Gate, I do not know, 
but that after all, I might have gone 
back again: but now I thank God I 
am here, and I thank you for 
receiving of me.
<pagebreak id="57" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Prudence</font> thought good to 
ask him a few questions, and desired 
his answer to them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Pru.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Do you not think somtimes of 
the Countrey from whence you came?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but with much shame 
and detestation; <font>Truly, if I had been 
mindful of that Countrey from whence I 
came out, I might have had 
opportunity to have returned, but now I desire a 
better Countrey, that is, an Heavenly</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pru.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Do you not yet bear away with 
you some of the things that then you were
conversant withal?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but greatly against my 
will; especially my inward and 
carnal cogitations; with which all
my Countrey-men, as well as my self, 
were delighted; but now all those 
things are my grief: and might I but 
chuse mine own things, I would 
chuse never to think of those things 
more; but when I would be doing of 
that which is best, that which is worst 
is with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pru.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Do you not find sometimes, 
as if those things were vanquished, 
which at other times are your 
perplexity.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but that is but seldom; 
<pagebreak id="58" />
but they are to me Golden hours,
in which such things happens to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pru.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Can you remember by what 
means you find your anoyances at times, 
as if they were vanquished?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, when I think what I 
saw at the Cross, that will do it; and 
when I look upon my Broidered 
Coat, that will do it; also when I 
look into the Roll that I carry in my 
bosom, that will do it; and when 
my thoughts wax warm about 
whither I am going, that will do it. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pru.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>And what is it that makes you 
so desirous to go to Mount</font> Zion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, there I hope to see 
him <font>alive</font> , that did hang <font>dead</font> on the 
Cross; and there I hope to be 
rid of all those things, that to this 
day are in me, an anoiance to me; 
there they say there is no death, and 
there I shall dwell with such 
Company as I like best. For to tell you 
truth, I love him, because I was by him 
eased of my burden, and I am weary 
of my inward sickness; I would fain 
be where I shall die no more, and 
with the Company that shall 
continually cry, <font>Holy, Holy, Holy</font> .

<pagebreak id="64" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Now he bethought himself of 
setting forward, and they were 
willing he should: but first, said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let 
us go again into the Armory, </dialogue><nonSpeech>so they

harnessed him from head to foot, 
with what was of proof, lest perhaps 
he should meet with assaults in the

acoutred walketh out with his friends  
<pagebreak id="65" />
to the Gate, and there he asked the

   <nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray did you know him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Por.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I asked his name, and he 
told me it was <font>Faithful</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know

    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Porter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is got by this time 
below the Hill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> good 
Porter the Lord be with thee, and add 
to all thy blessings much increase, for

to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he began to go forward, but 
<font>Discretion, Piety, Charity</font> , and 
<font>Prudence</font> , would accompany him down 
to the foot of the Hill. So they went 
on together, reiterating their former 
discourses till they came to go down 
the Hill. Then said <font>Christian</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> As it 
was <font>difficult</font> coming up, so (so far as 
I can see) it is <font>dangerous</font> going down. 
Yes, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Prudence</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> so it is; for it is an

into the valley of <font>Humiliation</font> , as 
<pagebreak id="66" />
thou art now, and to catch no slip by 
the way; therefore, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said they,</nonSpeech><dialogue> are 
we come out to accompany thee 
down the Hill. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So he began to go 
down, but very warily, yet he caught 
a slip or too.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Then I saw in my Dream, that 
these good Companions, when
