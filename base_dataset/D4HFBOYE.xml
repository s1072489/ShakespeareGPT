</dialogue> <head>NINTH DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>TO MAKE A VISIT IN THE
MORNING.</head> <dialogue>

   Where is thy Master?
   Is he asleep still?
   No, Sir, he is awake.
   Is he up?
   Is he stirring? Is he up?
   No, Sir, he is a bed still.
   How now! are you a bed still?
   I went to bed so late yesterday
that I could not get up betimes.
   What did you then after
Supper?
   As soon as you was gone out
they spoke of playing.
   Did you play?
   Yes, Sir, I did play.
   At what game?
   We played at Picket, Sir --
and I.
   And the others?
   Some play'd at Omber.
<pagebreak id="179" />
   Others at Basset.
   And others at Chess.
   Who won? who lost?
   My Lady Dutchess of <font>M.</font> won
twenty guineas.
   The Earl of <font>F.</font> lost fifteen.
   Sir -- <font>T.</font> won Ten Crowns
of me.
   As far as I see the loss or gain
were not of great moment.
   We never play but for diversion
sake.
   But methinks that gaming is
a very dangerous diversion.
   Especially when one plays deep.
   What, do you never play?
   Excuse me; but when I play,
I do not play high.
   We play for a small matter,
and we make it a point of Honour
to play fair.
   But now I think on't, till what
time did you play?
   Till twelve a Clock at night.
   What time did you go to bed?
   At one a Clock at Night.
   I don't wonder that you rise so 
late.
   What a Clock is it?
   What a Clock do you take it to 
be?
<pagebreak id="180" />
   I don't believe it is eight a
Clock.
   How, eight a Clock! it has
struck ten.
   I must rise then as fast as I 
can.

   They don't wear them now so
short as they did before.

   No, Sir, they sit very well.
   The breeches are very narrow.
   That's the fashion.
   They wear them very narrow.
   The rolls are not big enough.

   Are these my shooes?
   Yes, Sir.
   Put them on.
   They pinch me a little.
   They'll grow wider, by wearing
   But they will hurt me in the
mean while.
   My Corns will suffer for't.
   My feet are in the Stocks.
   Make me some others.
   You are hard to be pleased.
   Will you be pleased to try
another pair, which I brought by
chance.
   I will.
   They will fit you, I believe.
   I have my foot more at ease.
   What are these shooes worth?

   That's too much.
   'Tis a set price.

   Let's say grace.

</dialogue> <head>FIFTEENTH DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>TO SPEAK FRENCH.</head> <dialogue>

   Do you speak French?
   Are you very Learned in
the French Tongue?
   Not much, I know nothing almost.
   'Tis said however, that you
speak very well.
   I would it were true.
   I should know, what I do not.
   It will be true, if you please, 
and I shall teach you the way to
learn French quickly.
   You shall do me a very great
favour.
   The easiest Method to Learn
French, is to speak it often.
   But to speak, a body must know
something.
<pagebreak id="187" />
   You know enough already.
   I know but four or five words
which I have got by heart.
   That's enough to begin to
speak.
   Were it so, I should become a
great Scholar in a little time.
   Don't you understand what I
say to you?
   I both understand it, and
apprehend it very well.
   But I have not a fluent
expression.
   I can hardly speak.
   The facility of speaking will
come in time.
   I am too hasty.
   Tell me a little, how do you
call that?
   I believe, it is called.
   Very well, and this.
   Do I pronounce well?
   Pretty well. Indifferent.
   You want but a little
Practice.
   How long is it since you
learn?
   'Tis not above eight days.
   It is not a Month since.
   What is your Master of
Languages's name?
   His name is Master --
   How many times does he come
to teach you?
   He comes three times a week.
   How much do you give him a
month.
   I give him -- so much.
<pagebreak id="188" />
   Does he come three days one
after another?
   No, he comes every other day,
   To wit, On Mundays, Wenesday,
and Frydays.
   In the forenoon, or in the 
afternoon?
   In the forenoon.
   Where does he live?
   In <font>Grafton-street</font> <comment type="compiler">FONT CHANGE ONLY FOR Grafton IN SOURCE    
TEXT</comment> .
   At whose house?
   He lodges at a Taylor's, at the
sign of the Blue-ball.
   Does he not tell you, that you
should always speak French?
   Yes, Sir, he tells me so
often.
   Why don't you speak then?
   Who will you have me speak
with?
   With those as shall speak to
you.
   I'd fain speak, but I dare
not.
   Believe me, be confident, and
speak without minding whether
you say right or no.
   If I speak so every body will
laugh at me.
   Don't you know that to <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: so</comment> learn
to speak well, a body begins by
speaking ill.
   I shall then follow your
advice.
<pagebreak id="189" />
</dialogue> <head>SIXTEENTH DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>OF NEWS.</head> <dialogue>

   What news is there
abroad?
   Do you know any news?
   I have heard no news.
   What do they say abroad?
   There is no talk of any thing.
   Did you hear any thing of the
War?
   I heard nothing of it.
   There is a talk of a Siege.
   They said so; but that
report has proved false.
   On the contrary, they talk of
a battel.
   I have it of good hands.
   Do you believe we shall have
a Peace?
   I believe yes.
   For my part I believe not.
   What grounds have you for't?
   Because I see the minds of
both Partys are little inclin'd
that way.
   Mean while, it cannot be
deny'd but that Peace would be a
great advantage to Trade.
   What do they say at Court?
<pagebreak id="190" />
   They talk of a journey.
   When is it believed the King 
will go?
   It is not known. They say
nothing of it.
   Where do they say he will go?
   Some say into <font>Flanders</font> , others
upon the Fleet.
   And what says the Gazette?
   I have not read it.
   And to speak freely with you,
the designs of the Court are kept
so secret, that I think
Newsmongers know nothing of them.
   The Commanders themselves,
whom the King chuses to execute
his designs, do not know what
the preparations that are a
making in the Tower and in the 
Seaports are intended for.
   After all this can a body speak 
possitively of our affairs.
   Men of sence never speak of
those matters, but with great
wariness and discretion.
   For my part, I cannot excuse
the foolishness of some people,
who talk of Government without
being acquainted with it.
   They make peace and war,
according to their freaks, or
interests, and take upon themselves
to settle the Nation, when at the
same time they leave their
Families in a ruinous disorder.
   Let us speak of private news.
<pagebreak id="191" />
<comment type="compiler">ERRONEOUS PAGE NUMBER IN SOURCE TEXT: 119</comment>
   It is true, what is reported
of Master --
   What of him?
   They say he is wounded to
death.
   I would be sorry for't, he is
an honest man.
   Who has given him the wound?
   Two Knaves.
   Two Villains that set upon
him.
   Do they know upon what
account?
   'Tis reported because he spoke
ill of them, and gave a box in
the ear to one of them.
   I don't believe it.
   Nor I neither.
   Whatever it be, 'twill be
quickly known.

</dialogue> <head>SEVENTEENTH DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>TO ENQUIRE AFTER ONE.</head> <dialogue>

   Who is that Gentleman
who spoke to you just
now?
   He is an Englishman.
   I took him to be a German.
   He speaks very good French.
   Tho' he be an Englishman, he
speaks so well French, Italian,
German and Spanish, that
<pagebreak id="192" />
among the French they believe
him to be a French-man.
   He speaks <font>Italian</font> as the 
<font>Italians</font> themselves.
   He goes for a <font>German</font> with
the <font>Germans</font> , and for a
<font>Spaniard</font> among the <font>Spaniards</font> .
   'Tis a hard matter to be
Master of so many different
Languages.
   He has been a long while in
those Countrys.
   Is it long since you know him?
   'Tis about two years since I
know him.
   I got acquainted with him at
<font>Paris</font> .
   He is very genteel.
   He has a fine Presence.
   He is of a fine proper size.
   He is neither too tall nor too
little.
   He is handsom, and his shape
is easy and free.
   He has a noble gate.
   He has nothing unpleasant in
his ways.
   He is civil, courteous, and
complaisant with every body.
   He has a great deal of Wit
and is very jovial and agreeable
in Conversation.
   He Rides the great Horse
very well; He is quick and handy
to Fence, and Dances very neatly,
(or handsomly).
<pagebreak id="193" />
   He plays on the lute, the
guittar, and several other
instruments.
   But what renders him the
more commendable, is that he
has found the way to get the
Prince's favour. who often
bestows favours upon him.
   And who without question
will not fail to prefer him.
   I should be glad to get
acquainted with him.
   I shall get you acquainted
with him.
   Do you know where he lives.
   He lives hard by.
   When shall you and I go and
wait on him.
   When you please, for he is
my intimate Friend.
   'Twill be when you can spare
time.
   When it is convenient for you.
   At your leisure.

   Do you know your Lesson
already?
   Yes, Sir, I know it.
   Well, let's see. Rehearse

   Do you take notice how
cleanly the Mail is kept.
   What do they do with those
heaps of Cockle-shels?
   They spread them over the 
Mail, and bruise them
afterwards with the Roller.
   Let's go round the Park.
   Do you see, Sir, with what
violence the water comes in
that Canal.
   Yes, Sir, how comes that
about?
   'Tis because it Ebbs and 
Flows.
   But which way does the 
tide come in?
   Under ground.
   The tide comes in.
   The tide goes out.
   What does that fine brazen
figure represent.
   A man that fights at
Fisty-Cuffs.
   Let's go to the Sun-Dial
to set our Watches by it.
   Let's go now to the 
Bird-Cage.
   What sort of birds is there?
   There are several sorts of
them.

   Master <font>B.</font> to join profit to

   What Fable, Sir?
   That of the Lyon's Court.
   Tell me now the Story of

 <head>TO DRAW NEAR ONE.</head> <dialogue>

   Oh! the happy meeting.
   It is long since I had
not had the Honour to see you.
   I am very glad to see you
in good Health.
   Where have you been lost
all this long while?
   I have been in the
Country.
   How long have you been come?
   'Tis but two days since.
   Are those the two young
Gentlemen you bring up?
   Yes, Sir.
   They are both very 
handsom.
   How old is the eldest?
   He is but eight years and a 
half old.
   He is very tall for that 
age.
   He is very handsom.
   And He has the Gate, the 
Air, and the Manners of a 
Man of twenty.
   Does he speak good <font>French</font>
   He comes off pretty well of
a familiar Conversation.
   Do so much as to examin
him your self. --
<pagebreak id="200" />
   I assure you, I wonder at it,
He has a good accent, he speaks
very well.
   You may take notice that he
makes some faults, and does not
know some words.
   That comes partly because
he speaks with no body but me,
and so he cannot learn the
variety of Expressions which
arises by speaking to several
people.
   And besides, most part of the
words he does not know in
French, are those whose
signification he does not know in
English.
   But as soon as he shall begin
to get into Companies, he will
soon get the facility of
expressing himself.
   For I may say, that he
understands Historys, Plays, and
Romances pretty well.
   Have you begun to teach 
him Latin.
   Yes, Sir, he has some
smattering of it.
   And he understands besides
a little Geography.
   He is very forward.
   He has made great
progress.
   He cannot but become a
good Scholar under so good a
Master.
   I assure you, without any
flattery to him, that his good
nature, his wit and docility do
contribute to it more than I.
<pagebreak id="201" />
   And his little younger
brother, how old is he?
   He is six years and a
quarter old.
   He is extreamly handsom.
   One may see in him all the
little Graces which are
ascribed to Angels, and which had
never been till now, but in
the Painters fancy.
   Does he speak French too?
   Yes, Sir, and he reads it
indifferently. But he is full of
roguery.
   That becomes his age very
well.
   Do you return home?
   Yes, Sir.
   When shall I have the
honour to see you again?
   I shall give my self the
honour to wait on you at your 
house.
   You shall be very welcome.
   Farewel, till we meet again.

   We shall have company to

   There wants two plates.
   Boy, call for the

   It is not ready yet.
   They have rung the bell.
   The meat is on the table.
   Let's sit down at table.
   Sir, take your place.
   I won't suffer you to sit at
the lower end of the table.
   You shall sit at the upper end,
if you please.
   Indeed, I shan't.
   Let's forbear complements, I 
pray.
   Why do you make such

   Friends live freely

   Who says Grace.
   Do you love French 
Potage?
   Yes, provided the broth be
well made,
   Shall I help you to some
boiled meat.
   Help your self.
   Sir, you eat nothing.
   'Tis true, we have nothing
extraordinary to incite you to
eat.
   No question, but you have a
mind to jeer me, because I don't
commend this treat, otherwise
than by eating well.
<pagebreak id="203" />
   You are quick at repartee.
But however, I hope the
second Course will make amends
for the first.
   But, Sir, you han't drank
yet.
   Boy, give the Gentleman
some drink.
   Madam, my humble service
to you.
   Sir, I thank you.
   I am your servant.
   How do you like that beer?
   I like it pretty well.
   Let me taste it.
   For my part I think it is
too bitter.
   I'll scold at the Brewer for
it.
   Come, Sir, eat what you
shall like best for.
   What do you say of that
Neats tongue?
   Of that minced Meat? of
that Fricassee? shall I help
you to some Capon, some
Chicken, some woodcock, or some
Partridge?
   Ev'n as you please.
   What do you love best, the
Wing or the Leg?
   'Tis all one to me.
   Eat some Radishes to
sharpen (or whet) your stomach.
   I have eat too much
already.
   Give me a glass of Wine.
<pagebreak id="204" />
   Sir, my service to you.
   Come, Sir. I drink the
young Prince's health to 
you.
   I shall pledge you with all
my heart.
   There is excellent Wine.
   How do you find that
Pigeon-pye?
   Extraordinary good; very
well season'd.
   What? Dainty dishes after
so magnificent a second Course.
   You give us a Kings Feast,
instead of a Friendly Meal.
   The Fruit answers to all the
rest.
   You have gathered the most
exquisite Fruits <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Frnits</comment> the Season
affords.
   This Pastry-work is very well
made.

   You always beat me.
   I'll no more play with you,

   Indeed I cannot: See

   What shall we play for?

   But play fair.
   I never play foul.
   I take that <font>Pawn</font> .

 <head>TO GO TO SEE A PLAY.</head> <dialogue>

   There is a new Play Acted
to day, shall we go and
see it?
   With all my heart.
   It is a Comedy, or a 
Tragedy?
   'Tis a Comedy?
   What's its name?
   <font>The Old Batchelor.</font>
   Is this the first time it is
acted?
   No, Sir, this is the third
time, this is the Poets-day.
   I'll go and bid the
Coachman get the Coach ready, and
and we shall go the next
minute.
   Shall we go in a Box.
<pagebreak id="207" />
   I'll do what you please, but
methinks 'tis best to go in
the Pit,
   Why?
   Because we may pass the
time away in talking with
some body, before the Curtain
is drawn:
   What do you say of that
Symphony.
   Methinks 'tis very good.
   Don't you take notice of
that Hoboy that sounds so
finely among the violins and
harpsecol.
   The Boxes are full already.
   And as you see we are very
crowded in the Pit.
   I never saw the house so
full.
   There are a great many fine
People.
   I love as much as the Play
the sight of those fine Ladies,
who grace the Boxes.
   They are very finely drest,
(or in a fine Garb)
   They join the Beauty and
Charms of the Body to the
Richness of the Attire; and to
the brightness of their Jewels.
   Do you take notice of that
Lady, who sits next to the
Princess.
   Yes, I see her, she's pretty,
she's handsom.
   How pretty? You should say
that she's a perfect beauty.
   Do you know her?
<pagebreak id="208" />
   Yes, I know her.
   She has a fine easie shape.
   Have you took notice of her
Complexion.
   'Tis the finest Complexion
in the World.
   The whiteness of her bosom
(or neck) and the Vermilion
of her face, wrong the Lilies
and the Roses.
   She has teeth as white as 
snow.
   I think that she has a great
deal of wit.
   Beauty may be seen, but not
wit.
   Had she as much wit as
Beauty, one might say, that
she is an abridgment of all
perfections.
   But the Curtain is
drawing, let's hear.
   The Play is done.
   The Curtain is let down.

   I shall give you eight for it

   I shall see.
   Will you be pleased to buy the

   I go to buy it now, come

<pagebreak id="219" />
   Shew me the best you have.
   There is a very fine one,

   It is good, but the Colour
does not please me.
   There is another piece lighter
than the other.
   I like that colour; but the
cloth is too thin, it is not strong
enough.
   Look upon this piece here,
you will find none so fine in
another place, nor that will do
you so much service.
   How much will you sell it 
an Ell?
   Without exacting upon you of
a penny, it is worth twenty
shillings.
   I am not used to cheapen,
tell me the last word.
   I told it you, Sir, it is worth
so much.
   That's too dear; I'll give 
you eighteen for it.
   There is not a penny to bate.
And if you consider the
goodness and fineness of the cloth,
you'll find it very cheap.
   Come, come, cut two Ells of
it.
   I swear, upon my honest word,
that I don't get half a Crown
with you.
   Shew me now a strip'd cloth
for the Breeches.
   Here is one that will match
your close coat the best in the

   It never went out of my Shop
under six and twenty
Shillings.
   I'll give you at the Rate of
four and twenty.
   How much must you have of
it?
   Three Quarters <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Quarrers</comment> of an Ell.
   Here, Sir, there is your
mony; see whether I did
misreckon.
   I would not wrong you of a
farthing.
   Sir, the mony is good, and
well told.
   Come home with me to take
my measure.
   Shall I find the rest?
   That's without question.
   Line the Coat with some
good Silk, and the Breeches with
good Callico.
   You shall be contented.
   Buy me a good pair of Silk
Stockings.
   Will you have them knit or
woven?
   I will have them knit.

 <head>FOR THE JOURNEY.</head> <dialogue>

   How many miles (or leagues)
is <font>N.</font> from this place.
   It is eight leagues.
   We cannot go so far to day,
it is too late.
<pagebreak id="223" />
   It is not above twelve a
Clock at noon: you will arrive
there betimes.
   Is the way good?
   Not much, there are Woods
and Rivers to pass by.
   Is there any danger upon
the Road.
   There is no talk of it; 'tis
a Road where a body meets
with a people every moment.
   Don't they say, that there are
High-way-men in the Woods?
   There is nothing to be
feared either by day or night.
   Which way must one take?
   When you come near the hill,
you shall go to the right hand.
   We must not then go up the
hill.
   No Sir.
   Is it a difficult way through
the Wood?
   You cannot loose your way.
   When you are out of the
Wood, remember to take to the
left.
   I thank you Sir.
   Come, Gentlemen, come, let's
get on horseback.
   Farewell, Sir, farewell.
   I wish you a good Journey.
   Sir, if I don't mistake, your
horse has lost his Shoe.
   Will you be so kind as to
stay for me till I get him
shoe'd.
   With all my heart.

   Give us a fricasy of
Chickens, half a dozen Pigeons, a

   Pull of my Boots, and then
you shall go to see whether they
have given Hay to the Horses;

   Call for supper.
   Gentlemen, supper is

   Let's go to supper, 
Gentlemen, that we may go to bed

   Let's sit down, Gentlemen;

   There wants a Plate.
   Eat of that Fricasy, it is very

   The Pigeons are not enough.
   Give us some drink.
   My service t'ye, Gentlemen.
   Is the Wine good?
   It is not bad.
   Let's drink then.
   These Quails are very tender.
   You don't eat, Sir.
   I have no stomach; I am
weary and tired.
   You must cheer up.
   I'll certainly be better a bed

<pagebreak id="226" />
   Get your bed warm.
   Make an end of your supper;
Gentlemen, I go to take my rest.
   Do you find your self ill?

   Let's reckon Landlord, what
have we to pay, or what have 
we had?
   The Reckoning is not great.
   See what you must have for 
us, for our men, and for our
horses.
   Reckon your selves, Gentlemen,
and you will find, that there is
seven Crowns.
<pagebreak id="227" />

   On the contrary, I am very 
cheap.
   How much do you reckon for 
the Wine?
   I sell it to you fifteen pence
a Bottle.
   Bring another Bottle, and we
shall give you seven Crowns to

   Oh! Sir, you little know how

   I have one foot already in

   Truly, I am very sorry for it.
But it is possible that you will

Lord! I look wretchedly to day.

   How can I help it?
<pagebreak id="230" />
   Is not my Head wry?
   No Madam, it fits very well.
   Give me a clean handkerchief.
   Go now to the Foot-man and
bid him get a chair with a high
roof, or a very low seat.
   I run.
   Stay Mistress <font>sue</font> , you are so
ready to go to the Footman. --
   What will you be pleased to
have, Madam.
   Go first, and see whether my
Sister be ready, and if she be
willing to go to the Princess with me.
   Well, what says she?
   She is gone out already.
   Truly that's very handsome, to
disappoint me so.
   Did she not send me word,

five a clock.
   Yes, Madam.
   What a clock is it then now?
   'Tis hardly Five.

</dialogue> <head>XXXVI. DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>OF LOVE.</head> 

 <head>BETWEEN A LOVER AND
HIS MISTRESS.</head> <dialogue>

   So Fortune be prais'd, for the
blessing I have to find you
at home.
   'Tis no Miracle, I think.
   It is not, I confess, very
extraordinary, to find you at home;
but hitherto, Madam, I had
never the happiness to see you
there alone.
   Sir, you puzzle me. I cannot
imagine what you may have to
say to me.
   Many things, my dear Angel!
wrapt up in a Word, I Love.
   You love!
   Yes, I love. --
<pagebreak id="232" />
   That is not so impossible; but,
I think, you would do much
better to entertain her with your
love, who influences it; for
besides that, she might give you some
relief; you would free me from
the trouble, which is caused by
the recital of other peoples
misfortunes, to those who are not in
a capacity of helping them.
   Oh! how ingenious you are
to dissemble! Is it possible that
my looks and actions have not
convinced you a thousand times,
that your sparkling eyes influence
the torments I endure?
   The amorous Looks and
Civilities of men, are too
uncertain proofs of a true passion;
and they seldom make use of them,
but to try our Sex's Weakness,
and laugh at our Credulity.
   Oh! do not wrong me so much
as to judge of me by others:
I was never a lover by
profession <font>or</font> , a general Lover. I
never knew the power of Love
before the moment I saw you.
Suspect any thing in me but
dissimulation: I swear, my
charming <font>Caelia</font> , I love you more than
my self, and my love shall be
as lasting as my life.
<pagebreak id="233" />
   Every body speaks the same;
all men are alike in their
Language, and the Actions only,
make them appear different.
   Since nothing but Actions can
shew what we are, the only
favour I beg of you, is to judge
of my heart by them, and to give
me the occasion of convincing
you of the sincerity and pureness
of my flames.
   Alass! How easily we are
persuaded what we wish for!
Yes, <font>Lisidor</font> , I believe you love
me with a true love; and I
have no other trouble than the
fear of the blame I may incur,
if I encourage it.
   Oh! my dearest <font>Caelia</font> , you
so transport me out of my self,
that I don't know where to find
expressions to shew you my
Gratitude. But pray, what do you
ground your fears upon?
   I cannot tell it you now <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: know</comment> : It
is time for us to part, my
mother will be here presently, and
I should be sorry, she should find
us in a private Conversation.
   Alas! what a blow you
strike in my heart, when you
speak of parting, and with how
much grief am I forced to leave
you!
   We shall find the way to
meet again; mean while be
<pagebreak id="234" />
faithful, and I shall not be
ungrateful.

</dialogue> <head>XXXVII. DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>BETWEEN TWO COUZENS.</head> 

 <head>OF VISITS.</head> <dialogue>

   How now, Cozen, is no body
come to visit you to day?
   No body in the world.
   Truly, I wonder we have both
been alone all this day.
   I wonder at it too, for we
are seldom so; and your house,
thank God, is the Sanctuary of
all the idle Courtiers.
   To tell truth, this afternoon has
been very long to me.
   And I found it very short.
   Great Wits Couzen Love
solitude.
   What do I care for wit?
you know wit is not what I
pretend to.
   For my part, I love Company
I confess it.
<pagebreak id="235" />
   I love it too, but I love
a choice one, and the great
number of nauseous Visits, one is
obliged to entertain among the
others, makes me often love to
be by my self.
   That niceness is too great,
that cannot bear with none
but chosen persons.
   And that complaisance is too
general, that bears with all
manner of persons.
   I relish those that are
reasonable, and laugh at Fops and
Impertinents.
   Truly, Fops grow soon
tedious, and most of them please no
more at the second Visit.
   Madam, there is <font>Climene</font> that
comes to wait on your Ladyship.
   Oh Lord! what a Visit!
   You was grumbling for being
alone, so heaven punishes you for it.
   Quickly, go and tell that I
am not at home.
   They have told her already,
that you were.
   Who is that block-head as told
so?
   'Tis I, Madam.
   Deuce take the little Booby,
I'll teach you to make Answers
of your own self.
   Madam, I'l go and tell her
that you have a mind to be
gone out. --
<pagebreak id="236" />
   Stay, beast, and let her come
up, since the Folly is done
already.
   Why do you fall a
laughing?
   I laugh at your little Lackeys
Simplicity.
   Ah Couzen! how this Visit
troubles me now?
   No matter, it must go down
with you.

</dialogue> <head>XXXVIII. DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>OF PUPPET SHOWS.</head> <dialogue>

   Where went you yesterday
in the Afternoon?
   I went to give my Attendance
to the Duke of <font>Gloucester</font> .
   How does he do?
   He is very well.
   He always shews a great deal
of Wit and Liveliness.
   Did you play with him?
   Yes, Sir, we play'd a little,
whilst his Puppet-player was
getting his Puppets ready.
<pagebreak id="237" />
   How! was there a 
Puppet-Shew?
   Yes, Sir.
   Was that very diverting?
   Was his Highness well
pleased with it?
   Extreamly; he fell a
laughing now and then.
   What Country-man was the
Puppet-Player?
   He was a French-man.
   How do you know it?
   Because he spoke broken
English, and made <font>Punchinello</font> speak
French most commonly <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: oommonly</comment> .
   How could then the lookers on
understand what he said?
   The Puppet-players Wife was
his Interpreter.
   Was there a great deal of
company?
   Yes, Sir.
   How long did the Shew last?
   About an hour and a half.
   At what hour did you take
your leave of the young Prince?
   At Eight a Clock.
   What had you rather to see,
Puppet Shews or Jugglers.
   I admire the dexterity of
Jugling Tricks; but I find, 
Puppet-Shews more diverting and
pleasant.

</dialogue> <head> <font>XXXIX.</font> DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>OF MARRIAGE.</head> 

 <head>BETWEEN A FATHER AND
HIS DAUGHTER.</head> <dialogue>

   Daughter, your good nature
and tractableness have
not little contributed to increase
that love I ever had for you;
and seeing you are of an age
fit to be married, I have cast
my eyes upon Sir <font>N.--</font> to
be your husband.
   How! Father, a Maid of
my age marry Sir <font>N.--</font>
   Why not? he is a sober, staid,
prudent, and wise man, not
above Fifty, and who is cry'd up
for his great Estate.
   Marriage is a business of too
great consequence, to be so
quickly resolved upon, and since the
happiness of my whole life is at
stake, I beg of you to give me
some time to think on it.
<pagebreak id="239" />
   I know what is good for you
better than your self, and
therefore I tell you, that you shall
marry him to morrow.
   Since you urge me so far, I
must tell you my true Sentiments,
and confess to you, that I'd
rather throw my self into a
Nunnery, than to marry <font>S. N.</font> since
a Marriage cannot be happy where
there is no inclination.
   That's a thing, Daughter, which
may be, will come afterwards;
and they say, that Love is often
the fruit of Matrimony.
   But, Sir, there is a great
hazard on the womens side
and I shall never forget what
I have heard my Grandmother
say, That a Womans Vertue is
never so much in danger, as when
she is marryed to one she does
not like.
   Without so many Reasons, I am
Resolved you shall marry <font>S. N.</font> 
he is rich, and that must
satisfy you.
   And I protest to you, with
all the Duty and Respect I owe
you, that I won't be sacrificed
to Interest, since that great
unequality of Age, Humour, and
Sentiments, cannot but render a
Marriage lyable to many dismal
accidents.
<pagebreak id="240" />
   Did any body ever see a
Daughter speak so to her Father?
   But did any body ever see a
Father marry his Daughter so?
   'Tis a match which nothing
can be said against, and I lay
that every body will approve of
my choice.
   And I lay that it cannot be
approved by any reasonable
person.
   Will you yield to your
Brothers Judgment?
   I'll yield to no bodys
Judgment; my heart cannot submit to
such a Tyranny, and in a word,
I'll rather marry Death than
<font>S. N.</font>
<pagebreak id="241" />
</dialogue> <head>XL. DIALOGUE.</head> 

 <head>OF COUNTRY 
DIVERSIONS.</head> <dialogue>

   Sir, I am very glad to see
you; where do you live
now?
   We have been these two months
at a Country house.
   Are you come to Town for
good and all?
   No, Sir, I go back to
morrow morning.
   How do you enjoy your self
in the Country?
   How do you pass away the
time?
   I bestow part of it upon
Books.
   But which are your
Diversions after your serious
Occupations?
   I go sometimes a Hunting.
   What do you hunt?
   Sometimes we hunt a Deer,
and sometimes a Hare.
   Have you good Dogs?
   We have a Pack of Hounds?
<pagebreak id="242" />
   Two Grey-hound Dogs, two
Grey hound Bitches, four
Terriers, and three Setting-dogs.
   Do you never go a Fowling?
   Pardon me.
   What do you shoot at?
   All manner of Game, as
Partridges, Pheasants, Wood-cocks,
Wood-hens, Quails, Thrushes, <font>&amp;c.</font>
   Do you shoot flying, or
running?
   I do both.
   How do you catch Rabbits?
   Sometimes with Purse-Netts
and a Ferret, and sometimes
we kill them with a Gun.
   And Quails?
   Most commonly with a Net
and a Setting-Dog.
   Do you also fish sometimes?
   Very seldom.
   Why?
   Because we are a great way
from the River.
   But we have a Fish-Pond,
where we take Carps with a
Line.
   What do you do when you
neither Hunt nor Fish?
   We Bowl.
<pagebreak id="243" />
   Are you a good Bowler?
   I make a shift to cope with
another.
   Have you a good
Bowling-green? Is it even? Is it well
kept?
   It is pretty good. It is none
of the roughest.
   Do you sometimes play at
Billiards?
   Yes, Sir.
   Do you not play at
Nine-Pins too?
   I do not love much to play
at Nine-Pins, and I never do
it but out of Complaisance.
   As far as I see, your time is
so well employ'd, that you 
cannot be tired with being in the
Country?
   You think so, and yet 'tis
quite otherwise: I begin
already to long to be in Town; so
true it is, that men grow
weary of every thing.
