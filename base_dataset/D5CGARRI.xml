MALE-COQUETTE.</head> 

 <head>ACT I.</head> 

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter ARABELLA, and SOPHIA in Men's Cloaths.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Indeed, my Dear, you'll repent this
Frolic.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Indeed, my Dear, then it will be the
first Frolic I ever repented in all my 
Life. Lookee, <font>Bell</font> , 'tis in vain to
oppose me, for I am resolv'd -- the only Way to
find out his Character, is to see him thus, and
converse freely with him. If he is the Wretch he is
reported to be, I shall away with him at once;
and if he is not, he will thank me for the Trial, and
our Union will be the stronger.
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I never knew a Woman yet, who had Prudence
enough to turn off a pretty Fellow, because he had
a little more Wickedness than the rest of his
Neighbours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Then I will be the first to set a better Example.
-- If I did not think a Man's Character was of some
Consequence, I should not now run such Risques, and
encounter such Difficulties, to be better acquainted
with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, <font>Sophy</font> ! if you have Love enough to be
jealous, and Jealousy enough to try these Experiments
-- don't imagine, tho' you should make terrible
Discoveries, that you can immediately quit your
Inclinations, with your Breeches; and return so very
philosophically to your Petticoats again, ha, ha! --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You may be as merry with my Weaknesses, as
you please, Madam; but I know my own Heart,
and can rely upon it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
We are great Bullies by Nature; but Courage
and Swaggering, are two Things, Cousin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Since you are as little to be convinc'd, as I am to
be persuaded -- your Servant -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nay, <font>Sophy</font> -- This is unfriendly -- if you are
resolv'd upon your Scheme, open to me without
Reserve, and I'll assist you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font> <foreign>Imprimis</foreign> </font> , then; I confess to you, that I have a 
kind of whimsical Attachment to <font>Daffodil</font> ; not but
I can see his Vanities, and laugh at 'em.
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And like him the better for 'em --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pshaw! don't plague me, <font>Bell</font> -- my other Lover, 
the jealous Mr. <font>Tukely</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Who loves you too well to be successful --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And whom I really esteem --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
As a good Sort of Man, ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nay, shou'd have lov'd him --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Had not a prettier Fellow stept in between, who
perhaps does not care a Farthing for you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
That's the Question, my Dear -- <font>Tukely</font> , I say,
either stung by Jealousy, or unwilling to lose me,
without a Struggle, has intreated me to know more
of his Rival, before I engage too far with him --
Many strange Things he has told me, which have
piqu'd me I must confess, and I am now prepar'd
for the Proof.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You'll certainly be discover'd, and put to Shame.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I have secur'd my Success already.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What do you mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I have seen him, convers'd with him, and am to
meet him again to-day, by his own Appointment.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Madness! -- it can't be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
But it has been, I tell you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
How? how? -- Quickly, quickly, dear <font>Sophy</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
When you went to Lady <font>Fanny's</font> last Night, and
left me, as you thought, little dispos'd for a Frolic,
I dress'd me as you see, call'd a Chair, and went to
the <font>King's-Arms</font> -- ask'd for my Gentleman, and
was shewn into a Room -- he immediately left his
Company, and came to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I tremble for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I introduc'd myself as an <font>Italian</font> Nobleman, just
arriv'd: <font>Il Marchese di Macaroni</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ridiculous! -- ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
An Intimate of Sir <font>Charles Vainlove's</font> , who is now
at <font>Rome</font> -- I told him my Letters were with my
Baggage, at the <font>Custom-house</font> -- He receiv'd me
with all the Openness imaginable, and wou'd have
introduc'd me to his Friends; I begg'd to be
excuse'd, but promis'd to attend him to-day, and am
now ready, as you see, to keep my Word.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Astonishing! -- and what did you talk about?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Of various Things -- Women among the rest; and
tho' I have not absolutely any open Acts of
Rebellion against him, yet, I fear he is a Traytor at Heart
-- and then such Vanity! -- but I had not Time
<pagebreak id="5" />
to make great Discoveries -- It was merely the
Prologue -- The Play is to come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Act your Part well, or we shall hiss you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Never fear me; you don't know what a mad,
raking, wild young Devil I can be, if I set my Mind
to it, <font>Bell</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Laying hold of her.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You fright me! -- you shall positively be no
Bedfellow of mine any longer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am resolv'd to ruin my Woman, and kill my
Man, before I get into Petticoats again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Take Care of a Quarrel tho' -- a Rival may be
too rough with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
No, no, Fighting is not the Vice of these Times;
and as for a little Swaggering -- damn it, I can do it as
well as the best of 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Hush, hush! Mr. <font>Tukely</font> is here --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Now for a Trial of Skill; if I deceive him, you'll
allow that half my Business is done.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She walks aside, takes out a Glass, and looks at
the Pictures.</font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> TUKELY.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Your Servant Miss <font>Bell</font> -- I need not ask if
Miss <font>Sophy</font> be at home, for I believe I have seen her
since you did.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Have you, Sir? You seem disconcerted, Mr.
<font>Tukely</font> : Has any Thing happen'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
A Trifle, Madam -- but I was born to be trifled
with, and to be made uneasy at Trifles.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray, what trifling Affair has disturb'd you thus?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What's the Matter now? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I met Miss <font>Sophy</font> this Moment in a Hackney Chair,
at the End of the Street: I knew her by the Pink
Negligee`; but upon my crossing the Way to speak
to her, she turn'd her Head away, laugh'd violently,
and drew the Curtain in my Face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
So, so; well said, Jealousy </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
She was in Haste, I suppose, to get to her
Engagement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Yes, yes, Madam; I imagine she had some 
Engagement upon her Hands -- But sure, Madam, her
great Desire to see her more agreeable Friends, need
not be attended with Contempt and Disregard to 
the rest of her Acquaintance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Indeed, Mr. <font>Tukely</font> , I have so many Caprices,
and Follies of my own, that I can't possibly answer
for my Cousin's too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Well said, <font>Bell</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="7" />
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Answer, Miss! -- No, Heav'n forbid you should --
for my Part, I have given up all my Hopes as a
Lover, and only, now, feel for her as a Friend --
and indeed as a Friend, a sincere Friend -- I can't but
say, that going out in a Hackney Chair, without a
Servant, and endeavouring to conceal herself, is
somewhat incompatible with Miss <font>Sophy's</font> Rank and
Reputation -- This I speak as a Friend -- not as a
Lover, Miss <font>Bell</font> -- pray mind that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I see it very plainly, Mr. <font>Tukely</font> -- and it gives
me great Pleasure, that you can be so indifferent in
your Love, and yet so jealous in your Friendship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You do me Honour, Miss, by your good
Opinion.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Walks about, and sees</font> Sophy.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Who's that, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Gentleman who is waiting for <font>Sophy</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tukely.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think she has Gentlemen waiting for her every
where.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am afraid, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>coming up to him with her Glass</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
you'll excuse me, that notwithstanding your
Declaration, and this Lady's Compliments, there is a little
of the Devil, call'd Jealousy, at the Bottom of all
this Uneasiness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir! --
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I say, Sir, wear your Cloak as long as you
please, the Hoof will peep out, take my Word
for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Upon my Word, Sir, you are pleas'd to honour
me with a Familiarity which I neither expected, or
indeed desired, upon so slight an Acquaintance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I dare swear you did not.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Turns off, and hums a Tune.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I don't understand this!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
This is beyond Expectation -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I presume, Sir, you never was out of <font>England</font> --
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Picking her Teeth.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I presume, Sir, that you are mistaken --
I never was so foolishly fond of my own Country,
to think that nothing good was to be had out of it;
nor so shamefully ungrateful to it, to prefer the
Vices and Fopperies of every other Nation, to the
peculiar Advantages of my own.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, ha; well said, old <font>England</font> , i'faith -- Now,
Madam, if this Gentleman would put this Speech
into a Farce, and properly lard it with Roast Beef,
and Liberty, I wou'd engage the Galleries wou'd
roar and halloo at it for half an Hour together --
Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Now the Storm's coming. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="9" />
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
If you are not engag'd, Sir, we'll adjourn to the 
next Tavern, and write this Farce between us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I fancy, Sir, by the Information of your Face,
that you are more inclin'd to Tragedy, than
Comedy --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I shall be inclin'd to treat you very ill, if you
don't walk out with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I have been treated so very ill already, in the little
Conversation I have had with you, that you must
excuse my walking out for more of it; but if you'll
persuade the Lady to leave the Room, I'll put you
to Death -- Damme -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going up to him.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
For Heaven's sake! what's the Matter,
Gentlemen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What can I do with this Fellow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Madam, don't be alarm'd -- this Affair will
be very short -- I am always expeditious; and will
cut his Throat, without shocking you in the least:
-- Come, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>draws</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> if you won't defend
yourself, I must kick you about the Room. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Advancing.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Respect for this Lady, and this House, has curb'd
my Resentment hitherto: But as your Insolence
wou'd take Advantage of my Forbearance, I must
correct it at all Events -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Draws.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>SOPHIA <font>and</font> ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, ha, ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What is all this?
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What, would you set your Courage to a poor,
weak Woman? You are a bold <font>Briton</font> , indeed! --
Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What, <font>Sophia</font> ? --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Sophia!</font> No, no; she is in a Hackney-Chair, you
know, without a Servant, in her Pink Negligee` --
Ha, ha, ha. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am astonish'd! and can scarce believe my own
Eyes -- What means this Metamorphosis?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
'Tis in Obedience to your Commands -- Thus
equipp'd, I have got Access to <font>Daffodil</font> , and shall
know whether your Picture of him is drawn by
your Regard for me, or Resentment to him -- <font>I 
will sound him, from his lowest Note to the Top of his
Compass</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Your Spirit transports me -- This will be a busy,
and, I hope, a happy Day for me. I have
appointed no less than five Ladies to meet me at the
Widow <font>Damply's</font> ; to each of whom, as well as
yourself, the accomplish'd Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> has
presented his Heart; the Value of which I am resolved
to convince 'em of this Night, for the sake of the
whole Sex.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pooh, pooh! that's the old Story -- You are so
prejudic'd. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am afraid 'tis you who are prejudic'd, Madam;
for if you will believe your own Eyes and Ears --
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
That I will, I assure you -- I shall visit him
immediately -- He thinks me in the Country, and to
confirm it, I'll write to him as from thence -- But ask
me no more Questions about what I have done, and
what is to be done; for I have not a Moment to
lose; and so, my good Friend <font>Tukely</font> , yours --
My dear <font>Bell</font> , I kiss your Hand -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>kisses her Hand</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
You are a fine Woman, by Heav'ns! Here,
<font>Joseppi, Brunello, Francesi</font> , -- where are my Fellows
there? Call me a Chair -- <font> <foreign>Viva l'Amo`r, &amp; Liberta`</foreign> </font> --
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit singing.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, ha; there's a Spirit for you! -- Well now,
what do you stare at? -- You cou'd not well desire
more -- O, fie, fie, -- don't sigh, and bite your
Fingers; rouze yourself, Man; set all your Wits to
work; bring this faithless <font>Corydon</font> to Shame, and I'll
be hang'd if the Prize is not yours -- If she returns
in Time, I'll bring her to the Widow <font>Damply's</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Dear Miss <font>Arabella</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Well, well; make me a fine Speech another
Time. About your Business now --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I fly -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Tukely.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What a Couple of blind Fools has Love made of
this poor Fellow, and my dear Cousin <font>Sophy</font> ? Little
do they imagine, with all their wise Discoveries, that
<font>Daffodil</font> is as faithful a Lover, as he is an
accomplish'd Gentleman -- I pity these poor deceiv'd
Women, with all my Heart -- But how will they stare,
when they find that he has artfully pretended a 
Regard for them, the better to conceal his real
<pagebreak id="12" />
Passion for me -- They will certainly tear my Eyes out;
and what will Cousin <font>Sophy</font> say to me, when we are
oblig'd to declare our Passion? No Matter what --
'Tis the Fortune of War -- And I shall only serve
her, as she and every other Friend wou'd serve me
in the same Situation --

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> DAFFODIL <font>and</font> RUFFLE.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
But are you sure, <font>Ruffle</font> , that you deliver'd the
Letter last Night, in the Manner I order'd you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Exactly, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And you are sure that Mr. <font>Dotterel</font> saw you slip
the Note into his Wife's Hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I have alarm'd him, and you may be assur'd, that
he is as uneasy as you wou'd wish to have him -- But
I shou'd be glad, with your Honour's Leave, to have
a little serious Conversation with you; for my Mind
forebodes much Peril to the Bones of your humble
Servant, and very little Satisfaction to your Honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Thou art a most incomprehensible Blockhead --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
No great Scholar, or Wit, indeed -- but I can feel
an Oak Sappling, as well as another -- Ay, and I
shou'd have felt one last Night, if I had not had the
Heels of all Mr. <font>Dotterel's</font> Family -- I had the whole
Pack after me --
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And did not they catch you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
No, thank Heaven --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You was not kick'd then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nor can'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: RUFLLE.</comment> 
No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nor drag'd thro' a Horse-pond?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
O, Lord! No, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
That's unlucky --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You must go again, <font>Ruffle</font> , to Night, perhaps you
may be in better Luck.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
If I go again, Sir, may I be can'd, kick'd, and
Horse-ponded for my Pains -- I believe I have been
lucky enough to bring an old House over your
Head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What d'ye mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Mr. <font>Dotterel</font> only hobbled after me, to pay me
for the Postage of your Letter; but being a little out 
of Wind, he soon stopt, to curse and swear at me --
<pagebreak id="14" />
I cou'd hear him mutter something of Scoundrel,
and Pimp, and my Master, and Villain -- and 
Blunderbuss, and Saw-pit; and then he shook his Stick,
and look'd like the Devil!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Blunderbuss, and Saw-pit! This Business grows a
little serious, and so we will drop it -- The Husband
is so old and peevish, and she so young and pressing,
that I'll give it up, <font>Ruffle</font> -- The Town talks of us,
and I am satisfied.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray Sir, with Submission, for what End do you
write to so many Ladies, and make such a Rout
about 'em; there are now upon the List half a Dozen
Maids, a Leash of Wives, and the Widow <font>Damply</font> .
I know your Honour don't intend Mischief; but
what Pleasure can you have in deceiving them, and
the World? for you are thought a terrible young
Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Why that Pleasure, Booby.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I don't understand it -- What do you intend to do
with 'em all? Ruin 'em?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Not I, faith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
But you'll ruin their Reputations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
That's their Business -- Not mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Will you marry any one of 'em?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
O, no; that wou'd be finishing the Game at
once -- If I preferr'd one, the Rest wou'd take it
<pagebreak id="15" />
ill; so because I won't be particular, I give 'em
all Hopes, without going a Step further.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Widows can't live upon such slender Diet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
A true Sportsman has no Pleasure but in the
Chace; the Game is always given to those who have
less Taste, and better Stomachs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>RUFFLE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
I love to pick a Bit, I must confess -- Really, Sir,

'Twas the finest Scene imaginable -- You cou'd see,
tho' they all endeavour'd to hide their Liking to
<font>Daffodil</font> , all were uneasy at <font>Tukely's</font> Discovery. At
first, they objected to his Scheme; but they began to
listen to his Proposal the Moment I was call'd out
to you; what farther he intends, is a Secret to us all;
but here he comes, and without the Ladies.

I can see, Madam, that your Mind is not dispos'd

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I will not yet enquire into your Adventures, 'till I

you have a Mind to finish the Picture you have
begun this Morning, an Opportunity may offer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am contented with my Sketch -- However, I'll
make one; and if you have an Occasion for a Second

A Match -- from this Moment I take you as my

Can you doubt my Honour? Can you doubt my
Love? What Assurances can I give you to abate
your Fears?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs.</font> DOTTEREL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Very slender Ones, I can assure her. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I deserve to suffer all I feel  -- For what, but
the most blinded Passion, cou'd induce me to declare
myself to one, whose Amours and Infidelities are
the common Topic of Conversation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Flattering Creature! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- May I never
know your dear Name, see your charming Face,
touch your soft Hand, or hear your sweet Voice,
if I am not more sincere in my Affection for this
little Finger, than for all the Sex besides.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Ladies seem astonish'd.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="44" />
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Except the Widow <font>Damply</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
She! -- Do you know her, Madam;
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I have not that Honour --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I thought so -- Did you never see her, Madam, 
nodling and gogling in her Old-fashion'd heavy Chariot,
drawn by a pair of lean hackney Horses, with a fat
Blackamoor Footman behind, in a scanty Livery,
Red greasy Stockings, and a dirty Turban?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Widow seems disorder'd.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
All which may be only a Foil to her Beauty.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sighs.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Beauty! Don't sigh, Madam; she is past Forty,
wears a Wig, and has lost two of her fore Teeth.
-- And then, she has so long a Beard upon her
upper Lip, and takes so much <font>Spanish</font> Snuff, that
she looks, for all the World, like the <font>Great Mogul</font>
in Petticoats; ha, ha, --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Widow DAMPLY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What Falshood and Ingratitude! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Cou'd I descend to the Slander of the Town,
there is a married Lady --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Poor Mrs. <font>Dotterel</font> , you mean --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Why am I to be mentioned! -- I have nothing
to do --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Widow DAMPLY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nay, nay; you must have your share of the
Panegyrick.
<pagebreak id="45" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
She is young, and has Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
She's an Ideot, Madam; and as Fools are
generally loving, she has forgot all her Obligations to 
old Mr. <font>Dotterel</font> , who married her without a
Petticoat; and now seizes upon every young Fellow she
can lay her Hands upon; she has spoil'd me three
Suits of Cloaths, with tearing the Flaps and Sleeves.
-- Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Monster of Iniquity! --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
She has even storm'd me in my own House; but
with all my Faults, Madam, you'll never find me
over-fond of Age, or Ignorance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Widow DAMPLY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
cou'd tear him to Pieces. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I will tear him to Pieces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Be quiet -- and we'll all tear him to Pieces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
He has swallow'd the Hook, and can't escape.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What do you say, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am only sighing, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Fond Creature! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know there are a 
thousand Stories about me: You have heard too of
Lady <font>Fanny Pewit</font> , I suppose? Don't be alarm'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I can't help it, Sir. She is a fine Woman, and
a Woman of Quality.
<pagebreak id="46" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
A fine Woman, perhaps, for a Woman of
Quality -- but she is an absolute old Maid, Madam, 
almost as thick as she is long -- middle-aged, homely
and wanton! That's her Character.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lady PEWIT.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Then there is no Sincerity in Man. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Positively, you shan't stir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Upon my Soul, I pity the poor Creature! --
She is now upon her last Legs. -- If she does not
run away with some foolish Gentleman this
Winter -- She'll return into the Country, and marry
her Footman. -- Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lady PEWIT.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
My Footman shall break his Bones, I can tell
him that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Hush, Madam! I protest, I thought I heard a 
Voice -- I wonder they don't come. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
'Twas only I, Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> -- I was murmuring to
you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sighs.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pretty Murmurer! -- Egad, if they don't
come soon, the Lady will grow fond. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
But among your Conquests, Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> , you
forget Miss <font>Sophy Sprightly</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And her Cousin <font>Arabella</font> . -- I was coming to
'em; poor, silly, good-natur'd, loving Fools; --
I made my Addresses to one thro' Pique, and the
other for Pity -- That was all.
<pagebreak id="47" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
O, that I could believe you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Don't be uneasy, I'll tell you how it was,
Madam -- You must know, there is a silly, self-sufficient
Fellow, one <font>Tukely</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
So, so, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know him a little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am sorry for it -- The less you know of him
the better; the Fellow pretended to look fierce at
me, for which I resolv'd to have his Mistress: So
I threw in my Line, and without much Trouble,
hook'd her. Her poor Cousin too, nibbled at the
Bait, and was caught. -- So I have had my
Revenge upon <font>Tukely</font> , and now I shall willingly resign
poor <font>Sophy</font> , and throw him in her Cousin, for a 
Make-Weight. -- Ha, ha, ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lady PEWIT.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
This is some Comfort at least.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Your Ladyship is better than you was.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Noise without.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I vow I hear a Noise. -- What shall we do? It
comes this Way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
They can't see us, my Dear. -- I wish my Friends
would come. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't whisper or breath.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> SOPHIA, <font>in a Surtout, and slouch'd Hat.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
If I cou'd but catch her at her Pranks -- she
certainly must be this Way -- for the Chair is
<pagebreak id="48" />
waiting at the End of <font>Rosamond's</font> Pond -- I have
thrown one of her Chairmen into it -- and if I
cou'd but catch her --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
O, Sir! My Passion has undone me -- I am
discover'd; it is my Husband, Sir <font>George</font> , and he is
looking for me --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
The Devil it is! Why then, Madam, the best
Way will be for you to go to him -- and let me
sneak off the other Way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Go to him, Sir! What can I say to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Any Thing, Madam -- say you had the Vapours, 
and wanted Air.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Lord, Sir! -- he is the most passionate of
Mortals; and  I am afraid is in Liquor too -- and then he 
is mad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
If I cou'd but catch her -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Looking about.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
For your Sake, Madam, I'll make the best of my 
Way Home -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What! wou'd you leave me to the Fury of an
enrag'd Husband! -- Is that your Affection.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Holds him.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
If I cou'd but catch her -- Ha! what's that? I saw
something move in the Dark -- the Point of my
Sword shall tickle it out, whatever it is.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Draws, and goes towards 'em.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="49" />
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
For Heaven's Sake draw, and fight him, while I
make my Escape.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Fight him! -- 'twou'd be cowardly to fight in
the Dark, and with a drunken Man -- I'll call the 
Sentery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And expose us to the World?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I wou'd to Heav'n we were </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>He comes 
forward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me go, Madam, you pinch me to the Bone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
He won't know us -- I have my Masque on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>LADIES.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha! ha! ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What, is the Devil and his Imps playing at
Blindman's Buff? -- Ay, ay, here he is, indeed -- Satan
himself, dress'd like a fine Gentleman -- Come, Mr.
Devil, out with your Pitch-fork, and let us take a
Thrust or two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Daffodil.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You mistake me, Sir, I am not the Person --
indeed, I am not -- I know nothing of your Wife,
Sir <font>George</font> -- and if you know how little I care for
the whole Sex, you wou'd not be so furious with an
innocent Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Who are you then? -- And what are you doing
with that Blackamoor Lady there -- dancing a
Saraband with a Pair of Castanets? Speak, Sir!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray forbear, Sir; here's Company coming that
will satisfie you in every Thing -- Hallo, hallo --
<pagebreak id="50" />
Here, here, here; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hallo's faintly</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> my Lord, my

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lord</font> RACKET, <font>Sir</font> TAN-TIVY, SPINNER,
<font>and</font> DIZZY, <font>with Torches.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Lord RACKET.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What's the Matter here? -- Who calls for Help?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>Running to 'em with his Sword drawn</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, my
Friends, I have been wishing for you this half Hour.
I have been set upon by a dozen Fellows -- They
have all made their Escape, but this -- My Arm is
quite dead -- I have been at Cart and Tierce with
'em all, for near a Quarter of an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
In Buckram, my Lord! -- He was got with my
Property here, and I wou'd have chastis'd him for
it, if your Coming had not prevented it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Let us throw the Rascal into <font>Rosamond's</font> Pond.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord RACKET.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Come Sir, can you swim?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>All going up.</font> TUKELY <font>snatches</font> SOPHIA'S 
<font>Sword, and she runs behind him.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I'll defend you, my Dear -- What, wou'd you
murder a Man, and lie with his Wife too? -- Oh!
you are a wicked Gentleman, Mr. <font>Daffodil.</font>
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Attacks</font> DAFF.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Why, the Devil's in the Woman, I think.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>All the Ladies advance from behind.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>LADIES.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, ha, ha! your humble Servant, Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> --
Ha, ha, ha. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Courtsying.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="51" />
   <nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
This is all Enchantment!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lady PEWIT.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
No, Sir, the Enchantment is broke -- and the
old Maid, Sir, homely and wanton, before she
retires into the Country, has the Satisfaction of
knowing that the agreeable Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> is a much
more contemptible Mortal, than the Footman which
his Goodness has been pleas'd to marry her to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>LADIES.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Widow DAMPLY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Wou'd Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> please to have a Pinch of
<font>Spanish</font> Snuff, out of the <font>Great Mogul's</font> Box? 'Tis
the best Thing in the World for low Spirits.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Offers her Box.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>LADIES.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. DOTTEREL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
If a Fool may not be permitted to speak, Mr.
<font>Daffodil</font> , let her at least be permitted to laugh at so
fine a Gentleman -- Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>ARABELLA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Were you as sensible of Shame, as you are of Fear,
the Sight of me, whom you lov'd for Pity, wou'd
be Revenge sufficient -- But I can forgive your
Baseness to me, much easier than I can myself, for my
Behaviour to this happy Couple.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Who the Devil are they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Marquis and Marchioness of <font>Macaroni</font> ,
Ladies -- Ha ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ha! <foreign>Mio Carrissimo Amico</foreign> , il Signior <font>Daffodillo</font> !
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
How! <font>Tukely</font> and <font>Sophia</font> ! -- If I don't wake soon,
I shall wish never to wake again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>SOPHIA.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Who bids fairest now for <font>Rosamond's</font> Pond?
<pagebreak id="52" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord RACKET.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
What, in the Name of Wonder, is all this
Business? I don't understand it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DIZZY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Nor I neither; but 'tis very drole, faith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
The Mystery will clear in a Moment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFFODIL.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Don't give yourself any Trouble, Mr. <font>Tukely</font> ,
Things are pretty clear as they are -- The Night's
cool, and my Cousin <font>Dizzy</font> , here, is an Invalid --
If you please, another Time, when there is less
Company, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ladies laugh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- The Ladies are pleas'd to be
merry, and you are pleas'd to be a little angry; and
so, for the Sake of Tranquility -- I'll go to the Opera.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>DAFF. <font>sneaking out by Degrees.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord RACKET.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
This is a fine blow-up, indeed! Ladies, your
humble Servant -- Hallo! <font>Daffodil</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Lord</font> RACK.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>DIZZY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I'll lay you a Hundred, that my Cousin never

hugh -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> DIZ.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>TUKELY.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
As my Satisfaction is compleat, I have none to ask
of Mr. <font>Daffodil</font> . I forgive his Behaviour to me, as it
has hasten'd and confirm'd my Happiness here; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>to</font>
Sophia.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- But as a Friend to you, Ladies, I shall insist
upon his making you ample Satisfaction -- However,
this Benefit will arise, that you will hereafter equally
detest and shun these Destroyers of your
Reputation --
