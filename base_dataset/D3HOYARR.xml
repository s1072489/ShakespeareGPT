   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Young Lawyer come amongst us! perhaps you may   
learn something; I have
been telling these young Gentlemen you see with me by what means I
could make this Kingdom the most Flourishing Kingdom in the whole
World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sorry <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: sotry</comment> I am come to late  
to hear how so good an Effect might be so easily wrought.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay Sir, you are not come too late, for I can      
(without any weariness) sit here to tell
it all day long, I so greatly desire the Publick Good. In short Sir, 
what I have been saying is
this; I can plainly demonstrate how we may beat the <font>Dutch</font>        
without fighting, pay Debts
without Money, make all the Streets in <font>London</font> Navigable Rivers,  
harbour all the King's Great
Ships upon the top of an Hill, where they shall be secured from Wind 
and Weather, and from
an hundred other Accidents they are else obnoxious to. All or most   
of this you may see
printed in a Book of mine, which I know you Lawyers are against,     
because it likewise
maintains a Register, which spoils your Trade; but to be Friends     
with you, though I have undone
you in the First Part, I have a Second Part waiting at the Press,    
that will maintain you all
sumptuously, if there were ten times as many more as there are; what 
say you to all this
young Lawyer, Ha?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say you have out stripp'd all the Poets that ever  
wrote and that 'tis pity the King
and Council should have no more regard to your Person and            
Discourses, than wise man have
for <font>Mountebanks</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir the Reason's plain why they mind the           
Improvement of the Nation no more;
heark you, the Great ones have another sort of Game to play; -- no   
more of that --
you understand me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not I, I profess; I cannot be reconcil'd to half a   
Sentence join'd with a little
push, a wink, a nod, a smile, or a Finger held up to the Nose; I     
have hated those sort of
tricks, ever since I've read my Lord <font>Bacon's Essays</font> , where,     
under the Title of seeming wise
(he saith) such persons help themselves with Countenance and         
Gesture, and are wise by signs,
and when they know within themselves, they speak of that they do not 
well know, would
nevertheless seem to others to know of that which they may not well  
speak. Therefore Sir, if
you would do any good upon me, you must speak, and not leave me to   
conjecture what you
can say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Psha! I see you do not know the World: pray read   
this Paper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Club to consist of threescore Lords and Gentlemen  
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Genletmen</comment> . <font> <foreign>Imprimis</foreign> </font> , They shall be      
called <font>the 
Improvers of</font> England. <font>Item</font> , They shall meet twice in the      
week. <font>Item</font> . They shall have
provided for them a pennyworth of Cheese, Bread, Beer and Mustard. A 
brave Treat for Lords
<pagebreak id="2" />
I confess! I'le read no more, unless you tell me how this Paper is   
pertinent to our former
Discourse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is to satisfie you, that I am not only one    
that seem wise; for I was Chair-man
of the Club, and I tell you, there were some there under my          
Instructions, would have
baffled all the Coife; therefore whate're you may think on me, you    
see some Ingenious
Gentlemen have thought me fit to be their Instructor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That any Ingenious man desired you to be Chair-man,  
is more than I know, or ever heard
on before; But pray Sir no more of that! Tell me what you mean by    
saying <font>The Great Ones
have another Game to play</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will understand it too soon, I am sure I       
foresaw what's now coming upon us,
before you was born. -- We are a lost People -- a lost People! An    
undone Nation, An 
undone Nation!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Still more Riddles! Good Captain what's the matter?  
What's the City on Fire at one
end, and are they cutting Throats at the other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may sport at these things, you are but a young 
man, and cannot see so far as I
do: that Priest yonder, can tell you, 'twill not be long before you  
must burn, unless you are
resolved (as he is) to turn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know that Gentleman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never saw the man before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can you pretend to be acquainted with his        
Resolves?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you talk of pretend? pray who does not     
know that all the Clergy of the
Church of <font>England</font> (as you phrase it) are a Pack of -- I know what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you mean by <font>I know what</font> ? for my part I  
am very well satisfied, if you did
know what they were, you would speak of them with as much Reverence, 
as you do Detraction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Psha! I tell you they are all a parcel of          
Self-interested Fellows, and Papists in their Hearts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive you are such an Enemy to Prerogative,     
that you'l encroach even upon the
Almighty's, and not suffer him to monopolize the knowledge of        
Hearts; but how ignorant, as
well as impious this Affirmation is, will appear: for how can they   
be self-interested, and for
Popery? for if that comes in, there will a great many come to share  
with them in their
Spiritual Livings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a young man, and run too fast; for any one 
knows, if Popery gets once the
upper hand, all the Lands taken from the Church in <font>H.</font> 8. time    
will be restored again; though
some therefore doe come to share with them, yet their Advantages     
will be much greater.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may as well say every private mans Estate will   
be taken from him, and given to the
Church; for no man holds any Estate by a stronger Title, than the    
Purchasers of Church-lands
hold those Lands: for first they were sold by Act of Parliament, and 
in Queen <font>Maries</font> Days
instead of abrogating that Act, it was corroborated by another, to   
which the consent of his
Holiness was given; and if this be not Security strong enough, I'le  
be content (though I confess
'twill be a great punishment) to write in Vindication of a Register. 
But Sir, to let this Slip
of yours pass, pray instruct me for what reason our worthy Divines   
stand condemn'd in your
Judgment, for Papists?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what Reasons? Why, don't all the World know    
they are against Bringing in the
Bill, <font>&amp;c.</font> and that they openly pray for the Duke?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this all? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All! Ay and enough too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sorry to see you thus hurried on by a blind     
Zeal; for why should they not pray for
his Highness? Let him be good or bad, their Prayers are necessary;   
if good, that he may be so
preserved, if bad, that he may be reclaim'd and converted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shall not so much insist upon this; but as to    
the other Points, I mean the Bill: I 
have a Paper in my Pocket will confound all your Divines, and all    
your Lawyers put together;
here, do but read, and you'l be convinced.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, it's Intituled <font>A Word without Doors</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have read him already; but for my part, I neither  
approve of the Man, nor his Reasons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not the Man! Why you don't know who 'tis.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I know he fails in his Morals, by injuriously    
calumniating both His Majesty, and all
the Worthy Clergy of our Church: for <font>Pag. 3.</font> he tells you, 'tis  
the constant Practice of
Church-men to debauch young Gentlemen with ill Principles: and, the  
Episcopal Sees,
Deanries, <font>&amp;c.</font> were the certain and constant Rewards of such      
Services: such Superlative Impudence
ought to be quell'd, not with a Pen, but with the Magistrates Sword. 
However, this is to be 
<pagebreak id="3" />
said in alleviation of his Fault, what he has spoke, is so grosly    
false, that no one (in their Wits)
will believe him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray let this alone, come to his Reasons; methinks 
you do not care to meddle with
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will shew you, there is not one thing, in the      
whole Pamphlet, worthy the name of a
Reason; For as to the first and last position, which he so much      
endeavours to refute (and God
knows does it boldly enough) there is no need of them to maintain    
this Cause, so that the four
first Pages and the four last, (which the Gentleman is pleased to    
give us <font> <foreign>ex abundanti</foreign> </font> )
contains only a parcel of insignificant Stuff. As for his Instance   
of <font>Reboboam</font> , that God said This 
thing was of Him, what then? Therefore he approved of the Action of  
the Rebels. This
looks like the Logick of one that rails at the University. <font>Is      
there any Evil in the City, and I have
not done it</font> , saith the Lord; <font> <foreign>Ergo</foreign> </font> he approves of the    
afflicting Instruments. He hardned
<font>Pharoah's</font> Heart, that he might not let the Children of           
<font>Israel</font> go; <font> <foreign>ergo</foreign> </font> he was pleased with
<font>Pharoah</font> for keeping them. A brave Divine! Indeed the Church of   
<font>England</font> men and he do differ
in Opinion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but he hath other Instances.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I tell you Sir, they are all impertinent; for he     
hath neither proved his Cases to be
parallel to ours, nor that the Actors did what they did justly; the  
question between us, is not only
what hath, and what may be done; but what hath justly, and may       
justly be done; for unless he
will argue, Every thing that hath been done, hath been justly done   
(which is like his
Logick) he hath said nothing to the purpose. When he can prove that  
<font>William</font> and <font>Henry</font> did
justly exclude <font>Rob.</font> who was their right and true King <font>de       
Jure</font> , he will speak to the Point:
But pray observe his Reason why <font>Rob.</font> was put by; because         
<font>William</font> was not an honest man,
not because <font>Rob.</font> was dishonest. What think you, is not this a    
brave Fellow to be in Print?
I so much insist Sir, upon this Term <font>justly</font> ; because the        
Supreme Authority may chance to do
something unjust: (else instead of Destroying, he'l Make Popes) for  
they may do something
against the Divine Law. But to be short, what think you of           
<font>Strafford's</font> Case? I hope we all
know that Act of Parliament was sufficiently repented of, because    
'twas unjust. Let us see
then how it suits with our Case; <font>Strafford</font> received a more       
severe punishment by that Act,
than the Laws of the Realm had provided for such Offences; this was  
all, and here lay the
injustice of the Act. If this Bill had pass'd, the <font>D.</font> had        
receiv'd more severe Punishment
for his Faults, than the Laws of the Realm have provided in such     
Cases; either therefore, that
Act was just, or this Bill unjust. <font> <foreign>In Tricesimo Quinto</foreign> </font> of  
the Queen it is with good reason
provided, if any made open Submission and Declaration of his or      
their Conformity, that
then they shall be discharged, of and from all and every the         
Penalties and Punishments 
inflicted. Now suppose the D. should conform: if this Bill had       
pass'd, it had nothing availed him;
and though the meanest Subject in the Kingdom might have taken       
Advantage by his
Conformity, yet the D. could not; a most unreasonable thing. Now     
upon the whole matter I
appeal to any impartial man, whether this Argument will not hold:    
All Subjects ought in
reason and justice to bear equal Punishments for equal Faults. But   
if the Bill had pass'd, the
D. had had a more severe Punishment than any other Subject for the   
same Fault; Therefore, <font>&amp;c.</font>
We have hitherto taken it for granted the D. is a Papist, but now    
let us see whether the
Parliament could justly (when the Bill was brought) take notice of   
him as such; I demand
therefore, Had he been legally convicted of Popery?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot say that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then, every man is supposed innocent, till he be 
Tryed, and proved Guilty; and
I believe all people will agree to this Argument, That 'tis highly   
unjust to Condemn any man
unheard; but if this Bill had passed, the D. had been condemned      
unheard; therefore he had
been unjustly Condemned. 'Tis certain by the same Reason and         
Justice, they may make a 
Law to Condemn one man unheard, they may make a Law to Condemn all   
men unheard;
and how would you like such a Law?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive you conclude the Duke to be guilty of   
no other Fault but Popery;  but
alas! we all know there are a great many other Offences laid to his  
Charge, and things
of a high Nature too -- but no more of that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now are we to believe you have a thundering Reserve, 
when in truth you do not
know so much as you have spoke. Suppose him Sir, to be Actor of the  
most and 
greatest Crimes that ever mortal man was; let him (without Favour)   
be charged with them
all; but let him be summon'd to make his Defence, and then from what 
Imputation he
cannot clear himself, let him suffer for it according to the Laws in 
such Cases: But that there
should be new Laws made to punish His particular Person only, or     
that he should be condemn'd
<pagebreak id="4" />
unheard, are things I will maintain (against you and all the         
Fanatick Crew) to be
Dissentaneous both to right Reason and Justice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Talk what you will, I cannot believe but that the  
Parliament may lay the next
Heir aside: for what if he should be a Fool, or a Mad-man; must we   
be govern'd by 
him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I begin now to be weary with your Impertinence.      
Pray, who does not know 'tis
every man's Fate (according to Law and Reason) that is an Ideot, or  
Mad-man to
lose the Government of his Inheritance, and this rather fortifies    
than exonerates what
<font>I</font> have said: That Justice must be alike to all Subjects.         
Therefore <font>I</font> hope <font>I</font> have
fully evinc'd, that though the Divines are against the Bill, (which  
is more than either
you or <font>I</font> know) they are not for that blame-worthy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, talk as long as you will, I shall still be of 
the same mind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I see you are an obstinate, prejudic'd Man,    
therefore <font>I'le</font> 
take my Leave. <comment type="compiler">ONLY FIRST LETTER OF I'le IN ITALICS IN SOURCE
