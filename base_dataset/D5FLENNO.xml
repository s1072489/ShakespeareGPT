Country-Simplicity, knew a Compliment was expected
from her on this Occasion; and therefore
replied, &quot;That she did not wonder at the
Gentleman's staring at her; for she was sure he
had never seen any body so handsome as her
Ladyship before.&quot;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   I have not all the Beauty you attribute to me,

moderate Share of it, I might well fix the
Attention of a Person who seemed to be not
overmuch pleased with the Objects about him:
However, </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she, assuming a more 
serious Air,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if this Stranger be weak enough to
entertain any Sentiments more than indifferent
for me; I charge you, upon Pain of my
Displeasure, do not be accessary to the Conveying
his presumptuous Thoughts to me either by
Letters or Messages; nor suffer him to corrupt
your Fidelity with the Presents he will very
probably offer you.

<comment type="compiler">ARABELLA HAS RETURNED A LETTER FROM HERVEY (THE MAN IN THE CHURCH)
AND SPEAKS TO LUCY, HERVEY'S MESSENGER.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella</font> , who expected to hear, that the
Return of his Letter would make her Lover
commit some very extravagant Actions; and
having impatiently waited for an Account of
them from <font>Lucy</font> ; finding she seemed to
have no Intention to begin a Discourse
concerning him; asked her, at last, If she had
executed her Commission, and returned the
Letter to the insolent Unknown?</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Girl answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which not being all that her Lady expected,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
And how did he receive it? </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she,
peevishly.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Why Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Lucy</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe he
thought your Ladyship had sent him an
Answer; for he kissed the Letter several times.
   Foolish Wench! </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> How can
you imagine he had the Temerity to think I
should answer his Letter? A Favour, which,
though he had spent Years in my Service,
would have been infinitely greater than he
could have expected. No, <font>Lucy</font> , he kissed
the Letter, either because he thought it had been
touched at least by my Hands, or to shew the
perfect Submission with which he received my
Commands; and it is not to be doubted, but
his Despair will force him to commit some
desperate Outrage against himself, which I do
not hate him enough to wish, though he has
mortally offended me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella</font> was possessed of great Sensibility
and Softness; and, being really persuaded, that
her Lover would entertain some fatal Design,
<pagebreak id="17" />
seemed so much affected with the Thoughts of
what might happen, that <font>Lucy</font> , who tenderly
loved her, begged her not to be so much
concerned for the Gentleman:</nonSpeech><dialogue> There is no Fear,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>added she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that he will do himself a Mischief;
for when he discovered his Mistake, he laughed
heartily, as well as myself.
   How! </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> , extremely surprised,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Did he laugh!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which <font>Lucy</font> confirming,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doubtless,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she, having taken a little Time to
consider of so strange a Phaenomenon,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he laughed,
because his Reason was disturbed at the sudden
Shock he received: Unhappy Man! his
Presumption will be severely enough punished,
though I do not add Anger to the Scorn which
I have expressed for him: Therefore, <font>Lucy</font> ,
you may tell him, if you please, that,
notwithstanding the Offence he has been guilty
of, I am not cruel enough to wish his Death;
and that I command him to live, if he can
live without Hope.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>This being no more than what <font>Arabella</font>

asked <font>Lucy</font> , If she had delivered her Message
to him?</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Would you have me, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
go to his House? I am afraid the Marquis
will hear of it.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   My Father, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> can never be
offended with me for doing a charitable
Action.
   Ah! Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Lucy</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let me go
then immediately, for fear the poor
Gentleman should grow worse.
   If he be sick almost to Death, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed
<font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he will recover, if I command him to do
so: When did you hear of a Lover dying
through Despair, when his Mistress let him
know it was her Pleasure he should live? But
as it will not be altogether so proper for you to
go to his House, as it may be suspected you
come from me; I'll write a few Lines, which
you shall copy, and your Brother may carry
them to him To-morrow, and I'll engage he
shall be well in a few Hours.

   Well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried she, clasping her Hands
together, with Surprize,</nonSpeech><dialogue> my Lady said, her Letter
would cure him, if he was ever so sick; but I
did not imagine he would have been well
enough to come abroad so soon.
   Your Lady! </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>William</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> why was
it not yourself that wrote that Letter you gave

   No, truly, Brother, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she:</nonSpeech><dialogue> How

My Lady <font>made</font> every Word of it, and I only
wrote it after her.
<comment type="compiler">WILLIAM DOES NOT MENTION HE HAS KEPT THE LETTER AND LUCY RETURNS

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella</font> received the Account of her Lover's
Recovery as a Thing she was absolutely sure
of before; and thinking she had now done all
that could be expected from her Compassion,
resumed her usual Severity, and commanded

me with that Purity he ought to do, </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued
<pagebreak id="22" />
she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he will cease to importune me any further:
And though his Passion be ever so violent, his
Respect and Submission to my Commands will
oblige him to Silence. The Obedience he
has already shewn, in recovering at the first
Intimation I gave, that it was my Will he
should do so, convinces me, I need not
apprehend he will renew his Follies to displease
me.

human and divine, endeavour to possess yourself
by Force of a Person whom you are not worthy

I don't understand one Word you say: You
either mistake me for some other Person, or are
pleased to divert yourself with the Surprize I am
in: But I beseech you carry the Jest no farther,
and order your Servants to let me go; or, by
Heaven -- </dialogue><nonSpeech>cried he struggling to get loose,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if I
can but free one of my Hands, I'll stab the
Scoundrels before your Face.
   It is not with Threats like these, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed
<font>Arabella</font> with great Calmness,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that I can be
moved. A little more Submission and Respect
would become you better; you are now wholly
in my Power; I may, if I please, carry you to
my Father, and have you severely punished for
your Attempt: But to shew you, that I am as
generous as you are base and designing, I'll give
you Freedom, provided you promise me never
to appear before me again: But, in order to
secure my own Safety, you must deliver up your
Arms to my Servants, that I may be assured you
will not have it in your Power to make a second
Attempt upon my Liberty.

<comment type="compiler">ARABELLA BELIEVES A GARDENER IS A DISGUISED GENTLEMAN WHO HAS
ENTERED HER FATHER'S SERVICE OUT OF PASSION FOR HER.</comment>
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>These Thoughts perplexed her so much, that,
hoping to find some Relief by unburdening her
Mind to <font>Lucy</font> , she told her all her Uneasiness.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Ah! </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she to her, looking upon <font>Edward</font> ,
who had just passed them,</nonSpeech><dialogue> how unfortunate do
I think myself in being the Cause of that Passion
which makes this illustrious Unknown wear
away his Days in so shameful an Obscurity!
Yes, <font>Lucy</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that <font>Edward</font> , whom
you regard as one of my Father's menial
Servants, is a Person of <font>sublime Quality</font> , who
submits to this Disguise only to have an
Opportunity of seeing me every Day. But why do you
seem so surprised? Is it possible, that you have
not suspected him to be what he is? Has he
never unwittingly made any Discovery of himself?
Have you not surprised him in Discourse with
his faithful 'Squire, who, certainly, lurks 
hereabouts to receive his Commands, and is haply
the Confident of his Passion? Has he never
entertained you with any Conversation about me?
Or have you never seen any valuable Jewels
in his Possession by which you suspected him to
be not what he appears?
   Truly, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Lucy</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I never took
him for any body else but a simple Gardener;
but now you open my Eyes, methinks I can
find I have been strangely mistaken; for he does
<pagebreak id="31" />
not look like a Man of low Degree; and he
talks quite in another Manner from our
Servants. I never heard him indeed speak of your
Ladyship, but once; and that was, when he
first saw you walking in the Garden, he asked
our <font>John</font> , If you was not the Marquis's 
Daughter? And he said, You was as beautiful as an
Angel. As for fine Jewels, I never saw any;
and I believe he has none; but he has a Watch,
and that looks as if he was something, Madam:
Nor do I remember to have seen him talk with
any Stranger that looked like a 'Squire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lucy</font> , having thus, with her usual Punctuality,
answered every Question her Lady put to her,
proceeded to ask her, What she should say, if
he should beg her to give her a Letter, as the
other Gentleman had done?</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   You must by no means take it, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied
<font>Arabella</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Compassion had before like to have
been fatal to me. If he discovers his Quality to
me, I shall know in what manner to treat him.
<comment type="compiler">ARABELLA AND LUCY SEE THE HEAD GARDENER BEAT EDWARD WITH A STICK.</comment>
<pagebreak id="32" />
   For what Crime, pray, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Arabella</font> , with
a stern Aspect,</nonSpeech><dialogue> did you treat the Person I saw
with you so cruelly? He whom you take such
unbecoming Liberties with, may possibly -- But
again I ask you, What has he done? You
should make some Allowance for his want of
Skill in the abject Employment he is in at
present.
   It is not for his want of Skill, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the
Gardener,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that I corrected him; he knows his
Business very well, if he would mind it; but,
Madam, I have discovered him --
   Discovered him, do you say? </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted
<font>Arabella</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> And has the Knowlege of his
Condition not been able to prevent such Usage? or
rather, Has it been the Occasion of his
receiving it?
   His Conditions are very bad, Madam,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>returned the Gardener;</nonSpeech><dialogue> and I am afraid are such
as will one Day prove the Ruin of Body and
Soul too. I have for some time suspected he
had bad Designs in his Head; and just now
watched him to the Fish-pond, and prevented
him from --
   O dear! </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Lucy</font> , looking pitifully
on her Lady, whose fair Bosom heaved with
Compassion,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I warrant he was going to make
away with himself.
   No, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed the Gardener, smiling at the
Mistake,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he was only going to make away with
some of the Carp, which the Rogue had
caught, and intended, I suppose, to sell; but
I threw them into the Water again; and if
your Ladyship had not forbid me, I would have
drubbed him soundly for his Pains.
<pagebreak id="33" />
   Fye! fye! </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Arabella</font> , out of Breath
with Shame and Vexation,</nonSpeech><dialogue> tell me no more of
these idle Tales.
<comment type="compiler">ARABELLA AND LUCY DISCUSS THE CARP-STEALING.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella</font> , whose Confusion returned at that
disagreeable Sound, charged her, in an angry
Tone, never to mention so injurious a
<pagebreak id="34" />
Suspicion any more:</nonSpeech><dialogue> For, in fine, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she to her,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
do you imagine a Person of his Rank could be
guilty of stealing Carp? Alas! </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she,
sighing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he had, indeed, some fatal Design;
and, doubtless, would have executed it, had not
this Fellow so luckily prevented him.
   But Mr. <font>Woodbind</font> , Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Lucy</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> saw
the Carp in his Hand: I wonder what he was
going to do with them.
   Still, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Arabella</font> , extremely chagrined,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
still will you wound my Ears with that horrid
Sound? I tell you, obstinate and foolish Wench,
that this unhappy Man went thither to die; and
if he really caught the Fish, it was to conceal
his Design from <font>Woodbind</font> : His great Mind
could not suggest to him, that it was possible he
might be suspected of a Baseness like that this
ignorant Fellow accused him of; therefore he
took no Care about it, being wholly possessed
by his despairing Thoughts.
   However, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Lucy</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> your
Ladyship may prevent his going to the Fishpond again,
by laying your Commands upon him to live.
   I shall do all that I ought, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered <font>Arabella</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
but my Care for the Safety of other Persons must
not make me forget what I owe to my own.

   Since the World is so degenerate in it's
Customs from what it was formerly, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Arabella</font> ,
with a Smile full of Contempt upon her Cousin,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am extremely happy in having lived in a
Solitude which has not yet exposed me to the
Mortification of being a Witness to Manners I
cannot approve; for if every Person I shall meet
with for the future be so deficient in their
Respects to Ladies, as my Cousin is, I shall not care
how much I am secluded from Society.
   But, dear Lady <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted Mr.
<font>Glanville</font> gaily,</nonSpeech><dialogue> tell me, I beseech you, how I must
behave to please you; for I should be extremely
glad to be honoured with your good Opinion.
   The Person, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> whom I must
teach how to acquire my good Opinion, will,
I am afraid, hardly recompense me by his
Docility in learning, for the Pains I should be at in
instructing him.
   But, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that I may avoid any
more Occasions of offending you, only let me
know how you would be approached for the
future.
   Since, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> there is no Necessity to
renew the Ceremony of introducing you again
<pagebreak id="39" />
to me, I have no second Affront of that Kind
to apprehend; but I pray tell me, If all Cavaliers
are as presuming as yourself; and if a Relation
of your Sex does not think a modest Embrace
from a Lady a Welcome sufficiently tender?
<comment type="compiler">AN ASTERISK AFTER tender REFERS TO AUTHOR'S LONG FOOTNOTE:

cause no Reformation in the Coarseness of his
Manners to Ladies, which makes him so

Gain her Heart as soon as you can, and when
you bring me her Consent, your Marriage shall
be solemnized immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Glanville</font> needed not a Repetition of so
agreeable a Command: He left his Uncle's

Closet, with his Heart filled with the Expectation of
his approaching Happiness; and, understanding
<font>Arabella</font> was in the Garden, he went to her
with a Resolution to acquaint her with the
Permission her Father had given him to make his
Addresses to her.
   He found his fair Cousin, as usual,
accompanied with her Women; and, seeing that,
notwithstanding his Approach, they still continued
to walk with her, and impatient of the
Restraint they laid him under,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I beseech you,
Cousin, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> let me have the Pleasure of
walking with you alone: What Necessity is there for
always having so many Witnesses of our
Conversation? You may retire, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he, speaking
to <font>Lucy</font> , and the other Woman;</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have
something to say to your Lady in private.
   Stay, I command you, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Arabella</font> , blushing
at an Insolence so uncommon,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and take Orders
from no one but myself. -- I pray you, Sir, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she frowning,</nonSpeech><dialogue> What Intercourse of Secrets
is there between you and me, that you expect
I should favour you with a private Conversation?
An Advantage which none of your Sex ever
boasted to have gained from me; and which,
haply, you should be the last upon whom I
should bestow it.
   You have the strangest Notions, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered
<font>Glanville</font> , smiling at the pretty Anger she
discovered:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly you may hold a private
Conversation with any Gentleman, without giving
Offence to Decorum; and I may plead a Right
to this Happiness, above any other, since I have
the Honour to be your Relation.
<pagebreak id="43" />
   It is not at all surprising, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Arabella</font>
gravely,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that you and I should differ in Opinion
upon this Occasion: I don't remember that ever
we agreed in any thing; and, I am apt to
believe, we never shall.
   Ah! don't say so, Lady <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted
he:</nonSpeech><dialogue> What a Prospect of Misery you lay before
me! For, if we are always to be opposite to each
other, it is necessary you must hate me as much
as I admire and love you.

   If I do not express all the Resentment your

affecting more Scorn than Anger,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'tis because I
hold you too mean for my Resentment; but
never hope for my Pardon for your presumptuous
Confession of a Passion I could almost despise
myself for inspiring. If it be true that you love me,
go and find your Punishment in that Absence to
which I doom you; and never hope I will suffer

intended to carry her away; or, thinking her
Aversion to him proceeded from his having a
Rival happy enough to be esteemed by her, those
<pagebreak id="47" />
mysterious Words he had uttered related to his
Design of killing him; so that as she knew, he
could discover no Rival to wreak his Revenge
upon, she feared, that, at once to satisfy that

himself Master of her Liberty:</nonSpeech><dialogue> For, in fine, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she

Nature of that Passion, insulted me with a free
Declaration of Love, treated my Commands
with the utmost Contempt by appearing before
me again; and even threatens me with the
Revenge he is meditating at this Moment?

ON HER WAY FROM HER FATHER'S CHAMBER SHE MEETS GLANVILLE.</comment>
   Sure, Cousin, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he, a little piqued,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you
are not disposed to carry on your ill-natured Jest
any further?
   If you imagined I jested with you, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said 
<font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am rather to accuse the Slowness of your
Understanding, for your persisting in treating
me thus freely, than the Insolence I first
imputed it to: But, whatever is the Cause of it,
<pagebreak id="50" />
I know tell you again, that you have extremely
offended me; and, if my Father's Illness did
not set Bounds to my Resentment at present, I
would make you know, that I would not suffer
the Injury you do me, so patiently.
   Since you would have me to believe you are
serious, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> be pleased to let me
know what Offence it is you complain of; for
I protest I am quite at a Loss to understand
you.
   Was it not enough, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to
affront me with an insolent Declaration of your
Passion, but you must also, in Contempt of my
Commands to the contrary, appear before me
again, pursue me to my Chamber, and use the
most brutal Menaces to me?
   Hold, pray, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
and suffer me to ask you, If it is my
Presumption, in declaring myself your Admirer, that
you are so extremely offended at? 
   Doubtless it is, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered <font>Arabella</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> and
such a Presumption, as, without the aggravating
Circumstances you have since added to it, is
sufficient to make me always your Enemy.
   I beg Pardon, </dialogue><nonSpeech>returned Mr. <font>Glanville</font> gravely,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
for that Offence; and also, for staying any
longer in a House, which you have, so
genteelly, turned me out of.
   My Pardon, Mr. <font>Glanville</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is
not so easily gained: Time, and your
Repentance, may, indeed, do much towards obtaining
it.

assure you, that, if it contains any thing fatal,
I am not at all accessary to it: 'Tis true I have

Heaven is my Witness, I did not design his Death;

   Alas! my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know you come

Cousin's Account; but, I beseech your
Lordship, do not aggravate my Sorrows: Tho' I
banished Mr. <font>Glanville</font> , I did nor desire his Death;
and, questionless, if he knew how I <font>resent</font> it,
his Ghost would be satisfied with the Sacrifice
I make him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Marquis, not being able to help smiling
at this Conceit, which he saw had so strongly
possessed her Imagination, that she had no sort
of Doubt but that her Cousin was dead, asked
her, If she really believed Mr. <font>Glanville</font> loved
her well enough to die with Grief at her ill Usage
of him?</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   If, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he loves me not well enough to
die for me, he certainly loves me but little; and
I am the less obliged to him.
   But I desire to know, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted the
Marquis,</nonSpeech><dialogue> For what Crime it was you took the
Liberty to banish him from my House?
   I banished him, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> for
his Presumption in telling me he loved me.
   That Presumption, as you call it, tho' I
know not for what Reason, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Marquis,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
was authorized by me: Therefore, know, <font>Bella</font> ,
that I not only permit him to love you, but I
also expect you should endeavour to return his
Affection; and look upon him as the Man
<pagebreak id="55" />
whom I design for your Husband: There's his
Letter, </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued he, putting it into her Hand.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I blush for the Rudeness you have been guilty
of; but endeavour to repair it, by a more
obliging Behaviour for the future: I am going to
send after him immediately to prevail upon to
return: Therefore, write him an Apology, I
charge you; and have it done by the Time my
Messenger is ready to set out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Saying this, he went out of the Room; and
<font>Arabella</font> eagerly opened the Letter; and, finding,
it in a Style so different from what she expected,
her Dislike of him returned with more Violence
than ever.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   Ah! the Traitor! </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she aloud,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it thus
that he endeavours to move my Compassion?
How greatly did I over-rate his Affection, when
I imagined his Despair was capable of killing
him? Disloyal Man! </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued she, walking
about,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it by Complaints to my Father that
thou expectest to succeed? And dost thou
imagine the Heart of <font>Arabella</font> is to be won by
Violence and Injustice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>In this manner she wasted the Time allotted
for her to write; and, when the Marquis sent
for her Letter, having no Intention to comply,
she went to his Chamber, conjuring him not to
oblige her to a Condescension so unworthy of
her.
   The Marquis, being now excessively angry
with her, rose up in a Fury, and, leading her
to his Writing-Desk, ordered her, instantly, to
write to her Cousin.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   If I must write, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she, sobbing,</nonSpeech><dialogue>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arabella</font> , during the time her Cousin was
expected, appeared so melancholy and reserved,
that the Marquis was extremely uneasy:</nonSpeech><dialogue> You
have never, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he to her,</nonSpeech><dialogue> disobeyed me in any
one Action of your Life; and I may with reason
expect you will conform to my Will in the Choice
I have made of a Husband for you, since it is
impossible to make any Objection either to his
Person or Mind; and, being the Son of my
Sister, he is certainly not unworthy of you, tho'
he has not a Title.
   My first Wish, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is
to live single, not being desirous of entering into
any Engagement which may hinder my
Solicitude and Cares, and lessen my Attendance, upon
the best of Fathers, who, till now, has always
most tenderly complied with my Inclinations
in every thing: But if it is your absolute
Command, that I should marry, give me not to one
who, tho' he has the Honour to be allied to you,
has neither merited your Esteem, or my Favour,
by any Action worthy of his Birth, or the
Passion he pretends to have for me; for, in fine,
my Lord, by what Services has he deserved the
Distinction with which you honour him? Has
he ever delivered you from any considerable
<pagebreak id="59" />
Danger? Has he saved your Life, and hazarded
his own, for you, upon any Occasion whatever?
Has he merited my Esteem, by his Sufferings,
Fidelity, and Respect: or, by any great and
generous Action, given me a Testimony of his
Love, which should oblige me to reward him
with my Affection? Ah! my Lord, I beseech
you, think not so unworthily of your Daughter,
as to bestow her upon one who has done so
little to deserve her: If my Happiness be dear

I will never pardon you, if you presume to treat

not think it strange, if I insist upon directing

<comment type="compiler">ARABELLA AND GLANVILLE MEET AGAIN.</comment> 
   Well, Cousin, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> tho' you desire
to have no Empire over so unworthy a Subject
as myself, yet I hope you are not displeased at
my returning, in Obedience to your Commands.
   Since I am not allowed any Will of my own,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>said she, sighing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> it matters not whether I am
pleased, or displeased; nor is it of any
Consequence to you to know.
   Indeed but it is, Lady <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted he;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
for if I knew how to please you, I would never,
if I could help it, offend: Therefore, I beg you,
tell me how I have disobliged you; for, certainly,
you have treated me as harshly as if I had been
guilty of some very terrible Offence.
   You had the Boldness, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> to talk to
me of Love; and you well know that Persons
of my Sex and Quality are not permitted to
<pagebreak id="62" />
listen to such Discourses; and if, for that
Offence, I banished you my Presence, I did no
more than Decency required of me; and which
I would yet do, were I Mistress of my own
Actions.
   But is it possible, Cousin, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that
you can be angry with any one for loving you?
Is that a Crime of so high a Nature as to merit
an eternal Banishment from your Presence?
   Without telling you, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Arabella</font> , blushing,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
whether I am angry at being loved, 'tis sufficient
you know, that I will not pardon the Man who
shall have the Presumption to tell me he loves me.
   But, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> if the
Person who tells you he loves you, be of a
Rank not beneath you, I conceive you are not
at all injured by the favourable Sentiments he
feels for you; and, tho' you are not disposed to
make any Returns to his Passion, yet you are
certainly obliged to him for his good Opinion.
   Since Love is not voluntary, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I am not obliged to any Person for loving me;
for, questionless, if he could help it, he would.
   If it is not a voluntary Favour, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted
<font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> it is not a voluntary Offence; and, if
you do not think yourself obliged by the one,
neither are you at Liberty to be offended with
the other.
   The Question, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> is not whether
I ought to be offended at being loved, but
whether it is not an Offence to be told I am so.
   If there is nothing criminal in the Passion
itself, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> certainly there
can be no Crime in declaring it.
<pagebreak id="63" />
   However specious your Arguments may appear,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am persuaded it is an
unpardonable Crime to tell a Lady you love
her; and, tho' I had nothing else to plead, yet
the Authority of Custom is sufficient to prove it.
   Custom, Lady <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Glanville</font> , smiling,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
is wholly on my Side; for the Ladies are so far
from being displeased at the Addresses of their
Lovers, that their chiefest Care is to gain them,
and their greatest Triumph to hear them talk of
their Passion: So, Madam, I hope you'll allow
that Argument has no Force.
   I don't know, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what Sort
of Ladies there are who allow such
unbecoming Liberties, but I am certain, that <font>Statira,
Parisatis, Clelia, Mandana</font> , and all the
illustrious Heroines of Antiquity, whom it is a Glory
to resemble, would never admit of such
Discourses.
   Ah for Heaven's sake, Cousin, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted
<font>Glanville</font> , endeavouring to stifle a Laugh,</nonSpeech><dialogue> do not
suffer yourself to be governed by such antiquated
Maxims! The World is quite different to what
it was in those Days; and the Ladies in this
Age would as soon follow the Fashions of the
<font>Greek</font> and <font>Roman</font> Ladies, as mimick their
Manners; and I believe they would become one
as ill as the other.
   I am sure, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> the World is not
more virtuous now than it was in their Days,
and there is good Reason to believe it is not
much wiser; and I don't see why the Manners
of this Age are to be preferred to those of
former ones, unless they are wiser and better:
However, I cannot be persuaded, that Things
<pagebreak id="64" />
are as you say, and that when I am a little better
acquainted with the World, I shall find as many
Persons who resemble <font>Oroondates, Artaxerxes</font> ,
and the illustrious Lovers of <font>Clelia</font> , as those
who are like <font>Tiribases, Artaxes</font> , and the
presuming and insolent <font>Glanville</font> .
   By the Epithets you give me Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I find you have placed me in very
bad Company: But pray, Madam, if the
illustrious Lover of <font>Clelia</font> had never discovered
his Passion, how would the World have come
to the Knowlege of it?
   He did not discover his Passion, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed
<font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> till, by the Services he did the noble
<font>Clelius</font> , and his incomparable Daughter, he
could plead some Title to their Esteem: He
several times preserved the Life of that renowned
<font>Roman</font> ; delivered the beautiful <font>Clelia</font> when
she was a Captive; and, in fine, conferred so
many Obligations upon them, and all their
Friends, as he might well expect to be
pardoned by the divine <font>Clelia</font> for daring to love
her. Nevertheless, she used him very harshly,
when he first declared his Passion, and banished
him also from her Presence; and it was a long
time before she could prevail upon herself to
compassionate his Sufferings.

<comment type="compiler">GLANVILLE TRIES TO CONFORM TO ARABELLA'S IDEAL.</comment>
   When I reflect, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she, laughing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> upon the
Difference there was between us some Days
ago, and the Familiarity in which we live at
present, I cannot imagine by what means you
have arrived to a good Fortune you had so little
Reason to expect; for, in fine, you have given
me no Signs of Repentance for the Fault you
committed, which moved me to banish you;
and I am not certain whether, in conversing
with you in the manner I do, I give you not as
much Reason to find Fault with my too great
Easiness, as you did me to be displeased with
your Presumption.
   Since, </dialogue><nonSpeech>returned <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have not persisted
on the Commission of those Faults which
displeased you, what greater Signs of Repentance
can you desire, than this Reformation in my
Behaviour?
   But Repentance ought to precede
Reformation, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> otherwise, there is great
room to suspect it is only feigned: And a sincere
Repentance shews itself in such visible Marks,
that one can hardly be deceived in that which is
genuine. I have read of many indiscreet Lovers,
who not succeeding in their Addresses, have
pretended to repent, and acted as you do; that
is, without giving any Signs of Contrition for
the Fault they had committed, have eat and
slept well, never lost their Colour, or grew one
bit thinner, by their Sorrow; but contented
themselves with saying they repented; and,
without changing their <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: thetr</comment> Disposition to renew
their Fault, only concealed their Intention, for
fear of losing any favourable Opportunity of
committing it again: But true Repentance, as
<pagebreak id="68" />
I was saying, not only produces Reformation,
but the Person who is possessed of it voluntarily
punishes himself for the Faults he has been
guilty of. Thus <font>Mazares</font> , deeply repenting of
the Crime his Passion for the divine <font>Mandana</font>
had forced him to commit; as a Punishment,
obliged himself to follow the Fortune of his
glorious Rival; obey all his Commands; and,
fighting under his Banners, assist him to gain
the Possession of his adored Mistress. Such a
glorious Instance of Self-denial was, indeed, a
sufficient Proof of his Repentance; and
infinitely more convincing than the Silence he
imposed upon himself with respect to his Passion.
   <font>Oroondates</font> , to punish himself for his
Presumption, in daring to tell the admirable <font>Statira</font> ,
that he loved her, resolved to die, to expiate
his Crime; and, doubtless, would have done so,
if his fair Mistress, at the Intreaty of her
Brother, had not commanded him to live.
   But pray, Lady <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
were not these Gentlemen happy at last in the
Possession of their Mistresses?
   Doubtless they were, Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she;</nonSpeech><dialogue> but 
it was not till after numberless Misfortunes,
infinite Services, and many dangerous Adventures,
in which their Fidelity was put to the strongest
Trials imaginable.
   I am glad, however, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Glanville</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that the
Ladies were not insensible; for, since you do
not disapprove of their Compassion for their
Lovers, it is to be hoped you will not be always
as inexorable as you are now.
   When I shall be so fortunate, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
to meet with a Lover who shall have as pure
<pagebreak id="69" />
and perfect a Passion for me, as <font>Oroondates</font> had
for <font>Statira</font> ; and give me as many glorious
Proofs of his Constancy and Affection,
doubtless I shall not be ungrateful. But, since I have
not the Merits of <font>Statira</font> , I ought not to
pretend to her good Fortune; and shall be very
well contented if I escape the Persecutions which
Persons of my Sex, who are not frightfully ugly,
are always exposed to, without hoping to inspire
such a Passion as that of <font>Oroondates</font> .
   I should be glad to be better acquainted with
the Actions of this happy Lover, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
<font>Glanville</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> that, forming myself upon his
Example, I may hope to please a Lady as worthy
of my Regard as <font>Statira</font> was of his.
   For Heaven's sake, Cousin, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Arabella</font> ,
laughing,</nonSpeech><dialogue> how have you spent your Time;
and to what Studies have you devoted all your
Hours, that you could find none to spare for
a Perusal of Books from which all useful
Knowlege may be drawn; which give us the
most shining Examples of Generosity, Courage,
Virtue, and Love; which regulate our Actions,
form our Manners, and inspire us with a noble
Desire of emulating those great, heroic, and
virtuous Actions, which made those Persons so
glorious in their Age, and so worthy Imitation
in ours? However, as it is never too late to
improve, suffer me to recommend to you the
reading of these Books, which will soon make
you discover the Improprieties you have been
guilty of; and will, probably, induce you to
avoid them for the future.

Inclination to be agreeable to you, that I shall
embrace every Opportunity of becoming so; and
will therefore take my Instructions from these
Books, if you think proper, or from yourself;
which, indeed, will be the quickest Method of
teaching me.

blaming the Lady this sorrowful Lover
complains of, for her great Cruelty; for here he
gives one Reason to suspect, that she will not
even be contented with his dying in Obedience
to her Commands, but will hate him after
Death; an Impiety quite inexcusable in a

   You condemn the illustrious Princess with
very little Reason, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Arabella</font> , smiling
at his Mistake;</nonSpeech><dialogue> for, besides that she was not a
Christian, and ignorant of those Divine Maxims
of Charity and Forgiveness, which Christians,
by their Profession, are obliged to practise, she
was very far from desiring the Death of
<font>Oroondates</font> ; for, if you will take the Pains to read
the succeeding Passages, you will find that she
expresses herself in the most obliging Manner in
the World; for when <font>Oroondates</font> tells her he
would live, if she would consent he should, the

Princess most sweetly replies, &quot;I not only
consent, but also intreat it; and, if I have any
Power, command it.&quot; However, lest you

before condemned her for her Cruelty), 'tis

this favourable Behaviour to her Lover:

   However, <font>Charles</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> though I shall do
what I can to gain your Pardon from <font>Bella</font> , yet
I shall not scruple to own you acted extremely
wrong, in not reading what she desired you;
for, besides losing an Opportunity of obliging
her, you drew yourself into a terrible Dilemma;
<pagebreak id="76" />
for how was it possible for you to evade a
Discovery of the Cheat you put upon her, when
she began to talk with you upon those Passages
she had desired you to read?
   I acknowlege my Error, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>answered
<font>Glanville</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> but if you restore me to my Cousin's
Favour again, I promise you to repair it by a
different Behaviour for the future.

<comment type="compiler">THE MARQUIS GOES TO SEE ARABELLA.</comment>
   Ah! my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted <font>Arabella</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> speak
no more to me of that unworthy Man, who
has so grosly abused my Favour, and the
Privilege I allowed him: His Baseness and
Ingratitude are but too manifest; and there is nothing
I so much regret as my Weakness in restoring
him to Part of my good Opinion, after he had
once forfeited it, by an Insolence not to be
paralleled.
   Indeed, <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Marquis, smiling,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you
resent too deeply these slight Matters: I can't
think my Nephew so guilty as you would have
me believe he is; and you ought neither to be
angry or surprised, that he preferred your
Conversation before reading in a foolish old-fashioned
Book that you put in his Hands.
   If your Lordship had ever read these Books,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> , reddening with Vexation,</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'tis
probable you would have another Opinion of
them; but, however that may be, my Cousin is
not to be excused for the Contempt he shewed
to my Commands; and for daring, by the Cheat
he put on me, to expose me to the Shame of
seeing myself so ridiculously imposed upon.
   However, you must forgive him, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the
Marquis;</nonSpeech><dialogue> and I insist upon it, before I quit your
Apartment, that you receive him into Favour.
   Pardon me, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied <font>Arabella</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> this
is what I neither can, nor ought to do; and I
<pagebreak id="78" />
hope you will not wrong me so much as to
continue to desire it.
   Nay, <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> this is carrying Things
too far, and making trifling Disputes of too
great Consequence: I am surprised at your
Treatment of a Man whom, after all, if ever
you intend to obey me, you must consent to
marry.
   There is no Question, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
but it would be my Glory to obey you in
whatever is possible; but this you command me now
to do, not being so, I conceive you will rather
impute my Refusal to Necessity, than Choice.
   How! </dialogue><nonSpeech>returned the Marquis,</nonSpeech><dialogue> will you
endeavour to persuade me, that it is not possible
Mr. <font>Glanville</font> should be your Husband?
   'Tis impossible he should be so with my
Consent, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed <font>Arabella</font> ;</nonSpeech><dialogue> and I cannot give it
without wounding my own Quiet in a most
sensible manner.
   Come, come, <font>Bella</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Marquis
(fretting at her extreme Obstinacy),</nonSpeech><dialogue> this is too much:
I am to blame to indulge your Foibles in this
Manner: Your Cousin is worthy of your
Affection, and you cannot refuse it to him
without incurring my Displeasure.
   Since my Affection is not in my own Power
to bestow, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Arabella</font> , weeping,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not
how to remove your Displeasure; but,
questionless, I know how to die, to avoid the Effects
of what would be to me the most terrible
Misfortune in the World.
   Foolish Girl! </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted the Marquis,</nonSpeech><dialogue> how
strangely do you talk? Are the Thoughts of
<pagebreak id="79" />
Death become so familiar to you, that you speak
of dying with so little Concern?
   Since, my Lord, </dialogue><nonSpeech>resumed she, in an exalted
Tone,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not yield, either in Virtue or Courage,
to many others of my Sex, who, when
persecuted like me, have fled to Death for Relief, I
know not why I should be thought less capable
of it than they; and if <font>Artimisa, Candace</font> , and
the beautiful Daughter of <font>Cleopatra</font> , could brave
the Terrors of Death for the sake of the Men
they loved, there is no Question but I also could
imitate their Courage, to avoid the Man I have
so much Reason to hate.
   The Girl is certainly distracted, </dialogue><nonSpeech>interrupted
the Marquis, excessively enraged at the strange
Speech she had uttered:</nonSpeech><dialogue> These foolish Books my
Nephew talks of have turned her Brain! Where
are they? </dialogue><nonSpeech>pursued he, going into her Chamber:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I'll burn all I can lay my Hands upon.
