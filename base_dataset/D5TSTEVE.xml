   <nonSpeech>Question.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know the Prisoner at the 
Bar?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Answer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know the deceased Mr. <font>Francis 
Elcock</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you, at any time, employed to arrest
the Prisoner for Debt; and what happened in 
Consequence of it? Speak up, that the Gentlemen of
the Jury may hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I was employed to arrest the Prisoner,
for a Debt due to <font>John Atkin</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> By whom were you so employed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , an Attorney.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You mean, I suppose, the deceased Mr. 
<font>Elcock</font> , -- him that was shot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Being so employed, to arrest Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> ,
I went to his House, and knocked at the Door.
Some Body came to the Window, and asked me,
what I wanted? I told the Person who came to the
Window, that I had a Letter for the Master of
the House, which she took through the Window;
and I suppose it was delivered to Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why do you suppose so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because, in a little Time after, Mr. 
<font>Stevenson</font> opened the Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Prisoner opened the Door, you say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and he asked me, whether I lived with
the Gentleman who sent the Letter, or from whom
the Letter came? I told him I did; and Mr. 
<font>Stevenson</font> invited me in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well. what happened afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went into the House, with Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> ,
and we then went together, towards the back Door,
<pagebreak id="11" />
and at the back Door, Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> stood still,
to call his Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereabouts at the back Door did the
Prisoner stand still, to call his Servant? Was it
within-side of the Door, or at the out-side of the
Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He stood still upon a Step, at the back 
Door, the out-side of the Door; and I was 
within-side of the Door. -- I then took the Warrant I had
against Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> , out of my Pocket, and I
laid my Hand upon his Shoulder, and sayd, Sir, I
hope you will excuse me. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was the Prisoner then out of the Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. I sayd, Sir, I hope you will excuse
me; For the Letter I gave you, was to decoy you.
I am a Bailiff; This is a Warrant against you; and
you are my Prisoner in the King's Name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did the Prisoner say then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He screek'd out, and sayd, I had used him 
ill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you do afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> and I returned into the House,
and when we got into the Kitchen, he called to
<font>Betty</font> , who, I believe was his House-keeper, and
sayd to her, We have done ill, in letting this 
Man into the House; For, he has arrested me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> He told her, you had arrested him, you
say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well. What happened then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Prisoner went then towards the Fire,
and turned to the Screen on the right Hand, and
stood at the further End of the Screen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he do then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He turned, all of a sudden, upon me, with
a Pistol in his Hand, and sayd, he would blow
<pagebreak id="12" />
my Brains out, if I did not get immediately out of
the House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he present the Pistol at you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you say then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told him, that was not the Way to do 
Business. -- Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> then snapp'd the Pistol at
me, but it miss'd Fire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure he snapp'd the Pistol at you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, very sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, what did you do then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went backwards thro' the Kitchen, and
Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> followed me; and in a narrow Passage
leading from the Kitchen towards the Door, he 
snapp'd the Pistol at me again; and he snapp'd the
Pistol at me a third Time, but I was then out of
the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When you got out of the House, where did
you go then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went to the next House. I think Mr. 
<font>Nevills's</font> , where Mr. <font>Elcock</font> promised to be. Mr. 
<font>Elcock</font> saw me, and met me, and asked me, if I had
arrested <font>Stevenson</font> : I told Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , that I had 
arrested him, and that he had snapp'd a Pistol at me three
different Times, which obliged me to come away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did Mr. <font>Elcock</font> say to that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Elcock</font> sayd, I had done enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How did you proceed afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , if I had a Pistol, I could
bring him away; and he say'd, I should not want
that. -- Then Mr.<font>Elcock</font> sent a Man to the Plaintiff,
<font>John Atkin's</font> , and to bring Arms from his Father's.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did <font>Atkin</font> live?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Cholmondley</font> , not very far from <font>Bickerton</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Messenger return with Arms?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you then?
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the Arms and Assistance were brought,
We went again to Mr. <font>Stevenson's</font> House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who went to the Prisoner's House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went, and the Plaintiff <font>John Atkin</font> , and a 
Servant of his, I think. Four or five Persons I
believe, came with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there another Sheriff's Officer with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, a Man tolerated by the Sheriff, one
<font>John Jones</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Elcock</font> go to the Prisoner's House
with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What happened, when you all returned to 
the Prisoner's House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As we were all running towards the Prisoner's
House, I saw the Prisoner, and another Man out of 
Doors; I called to Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> , and sayd, you
may as well stay, for we are coming for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Prisoner hear you say this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the prisoner stay for you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, He, and the other Man with him, ran 
into the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, when you came up to the House;
pray, what followed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When we came up to the House, I sayd to
Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , I know the Way to that Door; Go
you to the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Doors were there to the House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know all the three Doors?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I knew them all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You bid Mr. <font>Elcock</font> go to one of the Doors,
I think, you say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I bid Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , and the others, to take
Care of two of the Doors, and I would go to the
other.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How far was the Door, that you sayd you
would go to, from the Door, you desired Mr. 
<font>Elcock</font> to take Care of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a good Way distant, in going round
about.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You sayd, you would go to the third Door,
Did you know the Way to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Elcock</font> say any thing to the People
in the House, when he came up to the Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, whether he did or not, because
I was not present, for I ran to the other Side of
the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray was the Door you went to, locked, or
made fast?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was fast.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When you all came up to the Doors, as you
have been mentioning, -- pray, what followed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a very little Time, almost immediately
after I came up to the Door, I heard a Noise. --
I heard a Gun go off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Which Way did the Noise come? Where
did you apprehend, the Gun went off. In what 
Situation were you from the Noise, or Report of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Noise came, as betwixt me and them;
betwixt me and the People who came with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How far distant might you be from the 
Door, where the Gun was fired?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nine or ten Yards it might be from Mr. 
<font>Elcock</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When you heard the Noise, and the Gun go
off, what did you do then? it must have alarm'd
you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I heard them crying out on the other
Side, I went backwards to an Hedge, and looking
<pagebreak id="15" />
over it, I saw Mr. <font>Elcock</font> held by two Men, sitting
on a Block.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You saw Mr. <font>Elcock</font> sitting on a Block 
supported by two Men, How did he look?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very piteously indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear him say any thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I heard him say, Oh! I am shot. I
am shot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr. <font>Elcock</font> at a great Distance from the
Gun, at the Time he received the Wound, or was
he near it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, whether he was at a great, or
a small Distance from it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you do, after you had seen Mr. 
<font>Elcock</font> sitting on the Block?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I returned again to my own Door, to 
prevent the Prisoner's getting out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see Mr. <font>Elcock</font> afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In about ten Minutes afterwards, I saw two
Men, carrying him down the Lane.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you with Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , at the House he 
was carried to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see him afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. I did not see him, after the two Men
carried him down the Lane.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you the Warrant whereby you arrested
the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray produce it. -- Is this the very Warrant, 
Under the Authority whereof you arrested the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, who delivered to you this Warrant to
execute?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Elcock</font> himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were there any Holes in the Door that the
<pagebreak id="16" />
Ball came thro' which killed Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , besides
the Shot-hole.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, there were two Holes in the Door, 
besides the Shot-hole.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there ever a Slit in the Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the two Holes in the Door higher than
the Shot-hole, or lower, or how?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The two Holes were higher than the Hole
which the Ball had made.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Could you see thro' the two Holes; were
they large enough to see, and know a Person
through?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I could see through them; I did look
through, and saw into the Kitchen plainly. I, and
several others did so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, what Business did Mr. <font>Elcock</font> go about,
when he went with you to the Prisoner's House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To assist me in re-taking Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know the Sheriff's Hand-writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is the Warrant whereby you arrested the
Prisoner, all of the Sheriff's Hand-writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All is of his Hand-writing, except two
Names.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you positive to the Sheriff's 
Hand-writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, to Mr. <font>Baxter's</font> Hand-writing, who
acted as Sheriff, and made out the Warrant, and
delivered it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, what are the two Names, that were
not written by Mr. <font>Baxter</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My own Name, and the Name of <font>John Jones</font>
another Bailiff.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who wrote your Name, and the Name of
<font>John Jones</font> in the Warrant?
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Elcock</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure of that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; for I saw him write them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you usually employed as a Bailiff, for
the executing of the Sheriff's Warrants?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. I get my Bread by it; and am often
sent for, fifteen or twenty Miles round the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was your Name inserted in the Warrant, as
the Sheriff's own Bailiff, or as a special Bailiff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was a special Bailiff, for that time, 
appointed by the Sheriff.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been informed so. I think it is so 
expressed in the Warrant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you executed any Warrants, from the
Sheriff of the County of <font>Chester</font> , the Year before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes many; twenty, or more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you executed any Warrants from the 
present Sheriff; -- Under his Authority?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. I executed Attachments under that 
Authority: -- Under Mr. <font>Baxter</font> . I had four or five
Warrants, upon Process out of the Exchequer, at
the time I arrested Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> , and have executed
several Warrants, since Mr. <font>Harrison</font> became
Sheriff.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How long had Mr. <font>Harrison</font> been Sheriff,
before you arrested the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Week or a Fortnight, it might be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Court.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Read the Warrant, whereon the Prisoner
was arrested by the Witness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Warrant was then read, and it appeared,
that the Words &quot;Bailiffs for this time only&quot; after
the Names of <font>John James</font> and <font>John Jones</font> , the
special Bailiffs, were written by Mr. <font>Baxter</font> . The
Warrant was dated the First of March last, and
there was an Indorsement thereon, Take good Bail
<pagebreak id="18" />
for Eighteen Pounds Eight Shillings and Ten-pence
Half-penny, by Affidavit filed. And under-written,
<font>Elcock</font> by <font>Lowe</font> , by the said Sheriff.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>John Evans</font> , the Sheriff's Bailiff named
in the Warrant, go with you, when you attempted
to re-take the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; he did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When did the Plaintiff <font>John Atkin</font> come to
you, was he with you before, or at the time you
attempted to re-take the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John Atkin</font> came, when Assistance was sent
for, but not before. He came with us, when we
went to re-take Mr. <font>Stevenson</font> .

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cross-Examined.</font> </nonSpeech>

Prisoner's Shoulder, and arrested him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, where did you first see that Warrant,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Of whose Hand-writing is the Warrant?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is all of Mr. <font>Baxter's</font> Writing, except

the City?
<pagebreak id="20" />

the Ball came thro', besides that which the Ball
made? -- Did you see the Hole which the Bullet 
made?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw the Hole, which the Bullet came
through; and there was also a Slit in the Door,
which seemed big enough for a Person to see through.
And there were two Holes besides in the Door? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How large were the two Holes that were in the
Door, besides that which the Bullet made?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One of the Holes was an Inch and half
Hole; the other bigger. But the Slit was afterwards
lath'd on the Inner-Side of the Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Could you have seen the Prisoner through
those Holes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt of it, if he had been opposite to
me when I looked through; but he was not, and
therefore I cou'd not see him.

surrendred himself?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Pistol which I fired off, was very heavy 
loaded: The other Pistol was discharged against
an Ash-Tree, and I saw the Hole which the bullet
had made in the Tree; and the Gun was fired into
the Air.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Prisoner surrendred himself, did
he acknowledge, that he had Fire-Arms in the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know the deceased, Mr. <font>Francis
Elcock</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you sent for at any time, and when,
to attend Mr. <font>Elcock</font> upon Account of his having
received a Wound, by the firing of a Gun, or
otherwise? -- Pray acquaint the Court, and Jury,
with what you know of this Matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon <font>Wednesday</font> the twenty-first Day of
<font>March</font> last, a Messenger came to me, about Three
o'Clock in the Afternoon, desiring me to go to
<font>Bickerton</font> , to Mr. <font>Francis Elcock</font> , who, the 
Messenger told me, was shot. -- I went accordingly
with the Man, and got to <font>Bickerton</font> about Five
o'Clock in the Evening. When I came there, I
found, that Mr. <font>Rowe</font> , a Surgeon from <font>Malpas</font> ,
had been sent for likewise, and had been there, for
some time before. Mr <font>Rowe</font> and I went up Stairs
together, to the Room, where Mr. <font>Elcock</font> was, and
We found him ill in Bed. Almost so soon as he
<pagebreak id="31" />
saw me, he pulled up his Shirt, and shewed me
where the Ball was lodged, <comment type="compiler">COMMA FAINT IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> and seemed 
impatient
to have it taken out: Upon seeing the Wound, I
took the Ball, between my Finger and Thumb, and
perceived, I cou'd easily dislodge it. I then 
examin'd the Wound, where the Ball had entred, and
found it cut about two Inches from the Hip on the 
left Side of his Belly: it pass'd thro' his Belly, by
his Bowels no doubt, and lodged five or six Inches
below his right Hip, almost through the Skin. As
soon as I saw this, I took Mr. <font>Rowe</font> into another
Room, to consult, what was fittest to be done;
and I told him, it was my Opinion, that Mr. <font>Elcock</font>
was a dying Man, and that I did not know, 
whether it would be of any Use, to take the Ball away,
altho' it could be so easily effected -- But, 
considering, that it wou'd give him some Satisfaction,
and perhaps Ease too, by taking the Ball from the
Place where it did lie, Mr. <font>Rowe</font> and I went into
the Room again, and I took out the Ball. -- After
I had taken the Ball out, and dressed the Wound,
and put a Bandage about it, I asked Mr. <font>Elcock</font> ,
how he did? He sayd he was easier. Doctor <font>Hayes</font>
came in afterwards, and when I had told him, the
Nature of the Wound, he look'd upon the Case to
be extremely dangerous. The Doctor stayd with
him two or three Hours and then went away; but
Mr. <font>Elcock</font> desired me and Mrs. <font>Nevill</font> to sit with
him, which we did, and his Father did so too, till
ten Minutes past Three the next Morning, and he
then expired. </dialogue><nonSpeech>-- The Witness produces the Ball.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe, that the Wound which
Mr. <font>Elcock</font> received, was the Occasion of his Death?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I firmly believe, that the Wound which he
received was the Occasion of his Death.
<pagebreak id="32" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Elcock</font> say any thing to you in his
Agonies, upon the melancholy Occasion, and
what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Elcock</font> told me, that he was shot, as he
was stooping down, with a Crowe in his Hand,
striving to open the Prisoner's Door?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you, from what Part of the House 
he was shot?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He sayd, he received the Wound at the
Door of the Prisoner's House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, how came the Ball to be made so flat:
in that uncommon Form?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe its going through the Door, was
the Occasion of its being in that Form.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Witness with-drew.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Cryer,</nonSpeech><dialogue> call Mr. <font>Baxter</font> .

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Robert Baxter</font> sworn.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Counsel for the Crown.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Mr. <font>Baxter</font> , Are you concern'd in
any, and what Manner, for Mr. <font>Harrison</font> , the
present Sheriff of the County of <font>Chester</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I am concerned for the Sheriff,
and keep his Office.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you make out Warrants for the Sheriff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you receive at any time, and when, a 
Writ against the Prisoner, at the Suit of <font>John
Atkin</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I received a Writ against him upon the First
of <font>March</font> last. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (which he produces.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Look upon that Warrant. -- Did you make
out that Warrant upon the Writ, in order to arrest
the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did.
<pagebreak id="33" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And are you sure, that is the same Warrant
you did make out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; I am sure it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Writ was read, and upon the Back of it,
was written, &quot;Take Bail for Eighteen Pounds Eight
Shillings and Ten-pence Half-Penny, by Affidavit
filed,&quot; -- And another Indorsement, viz. -- &quot;I 
promise to indemnify the Sheriff, in the Execution of
the Writ, as to the special Bailiffs. <font>John Atkin.</font> &quot;</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it usual for the Sheriff to appoint a 
Gentleman in this Town to execute the Office, and to act
for him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is usual. -- I have been several Times 
appointed myself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you receive all the Writs that are sued 
out directed to the Sheriff of this County?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And do you make out the Warrants upon
such Writs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And return the Writs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you execute all other Acts, that the
Sheriff would do, if he resided here himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. Except attending the Assizes and 
Sessions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And has this been the constant Practice in
this County?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, during all my Time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Has it been usual, when Plaintiffs would
have special Bailiffs appointed, to leave Blanks in 
the Warrants for their Names to be inserted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, upon the Sheriff being indemnified.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you done this yourself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you known others to do it?
<pagebreak id="34" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, several others to my Knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know it to be refused?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never, upon the Sheriff being 
indemnified, and the Attorney is known to be a fair 
Practicer. -- I have known it refused, where the 
Practicer was not liked, or where the Sheriff run
any Risque or Hazard, and the Indemnity was not
approved; But when the Attorney, or Practicer,
and the Indemnity are liked, it is usually done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, what is the Nature of the Indemnity
given to the Sheriff upon this Occasion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is, that he should not suffer by Escapes
or Rescues.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And has this been the constant Practice used
by the Persons, who have acted in the Sheriff's
Office, in the Capacity you now act?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It has been so, all the time I have known
the Office.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How long, pray, is that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seven or eight and twenty Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To leave Blanks in the Warrants, for the
Names of the special Bailiffs to be inserted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Whether is such Practice convenient 
to the Plaintiffs and Suitors in the Court, or 
inconvenient to them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is look'd upon to be very convenient for
the Plaintiffs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think so yourself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I look upon it in that Light.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Had Mr. <font>Lowe</font> , or Mr. <font>Elcock</font> , or both of 
them a Right, to insert the Names of the special
Bailiffs, in the Blank left in the Warrant, whereon
the Prisoner was arrested?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I apprehend, either Mr. <font>Lowe</font> , or Mr. <font>Elcock</font>
had a Right to do so?
<pagebreak id="35" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it usual for Attornies in the Country, to
send their Directions to their Agents in <font>Chester</font> to
take out Writs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And is the Agent's Name generally put to
the Writ, or the Name of the Attorney in the 
Country only?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Agent's Name is generally added to the 
Name of the Country Attorney, in the Writ, since
the late Act of Parliament for that Purpose; but
before that, the Name of the Attorney was only 
put to the Writ.
    </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And you say that either Mr. <font>Lowe</font> , or Mr. 
<font>Elcock</font> , had a Right to insert the Names of the
special Bailiffs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. I apprehend so.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cross-examined.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Counsel for the Prisoner.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do not the Attornies, and other Persons,
usually send the Names of the special Bailiffs, to 
be inserted in the Warrants, by the Sheriff, or by
those who act for him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes People do send the Names of
the special Bailiffs, to be inserted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Has it not been the most usual Way, in
your Time, to do so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was when I first knew the Office the most
usual Way, in 1732 and 1733. -- But Warrants
went out with Blanks then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>John Evans</font> , the Bailiff named in the
Warrant, indemnify the Sheriff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has given Security to the Sheriff, I 
believe. -- But the Indemnity was for the special
Bailiffs.
<pagebreak id="36" /> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In the year 1732, or 1733, Were blank 
Warrants sent out, and not the Names of the 
special Bailiffs inserted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I was concerned for Mr. <font>Page</font> , who
was Sheriff in 1732 or 1733, several blank 
Warrants were sent out, and not the special Bailiffs 
inserted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Warrants were sent out, with
Blanks for the Names of the special Bailiffs, in Mr.
<font>Page's</font> Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were not Warrants oftner delivered, with
the Names of the special Bailiffs inserted in the
Office, before they were sent out, than Warrants
with Blanks, for the Names of the special Bailiffs,
to be afterwards inserted by the Attornies?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe, Warrants were oftner sent out,
with the Names of the special Bailiffs inserted,
than with Blanks.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that the Warrant, you made out on the 
Writ the First of <font>March</font> against the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>A.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Looks at the Warrant.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is the same 
Warrant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it in the same Situation it was, when you
delivered it out of your Hands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How has it been altered? how does it differ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Names, <font>John James</font> , and <font>John Jones</font> ,
have been since inserted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, was the Seal to the Warrant before
you delivered it out of your Hands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure of that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, for I put the Seal to it myself.
<pagebreak id="37" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Court.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember, that any Arrest was
ever set aside, or disputed, on Account of a Blank
Warrant having been sent out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, never.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Counsel for the Prisoner.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Through all the Course of your Practice, has
it not been most usual, to make out Warrants, after
you received the Names of the special Bailiffs, than
without them; -- than making out blank Warrants?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it has been most usual, I think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> When the Names of the special Bailiffs are
sent, Do you always insert them in the Warrants?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, how is the Under-Sheriff of <font>Cheshire</font>
appointed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is appointed by the Sheriff, by Deed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any written Authority from the
Sheriff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No further, than by Letters sent me 
sometimes, about the Business of the Office.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How were you appointed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Night before the Sheriff was sworn, I
supped with him, and it was agreed, I shou'd act
for him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who were present, when you were 
appointed, to act for the Sheriff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Sheriff, and the Under-Sheriff, were both
present, and appointed me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you appointed by any Instrument in
Writing, or not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it usual for the Sheriff and Under-Sheriff,
both to appoint an Agent, to act for the Sheriff?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe, the usual Way is by the 
Under-Sheriff only.
<pagebreak id="38" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is there no other Method of appointing a
Person, to act for the Sheriff, but by Parol?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know of any other Way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is the Seal to the Writ, the Seal of Office?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have the Persons concern'd for the Sheriff
of this County, usually that Sort of Seal?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Where had you this Seal?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had this from Mr. <font>Griffith</font> , having lost my
own.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Witness with-drew.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Gastrell</font> , Clerk to Mr. <font>Lowe</font> , an Attorney
in <font>Chester</font> , was then called, to prove that <font>John
Atkin</font> signed the Indemnity given to the Sheriff,
when the blank Warrant against the Prisoner was
sent out. But the Court thought it unnecessary to
examine him.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cross</font> , an Attorney in <font>Chester</font> , sworn.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Counsel for the Crown.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you acquainted with the Method of
suing out Process, in the Court of Session for this
County?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it usual, to send out Warrants, from the
Sheriff's Office, with Blanks for the Names of the
special Bailiffs to be inserted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When special Bailiffs are desired, Warrants
frequently issue with Blanks, for their Names to
be inserted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know this to be frequently done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Counsel for the Prisoner.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But is it not more usual, for the Names of
the special Bailiffs to be put into the Warrants, in
the Office, before they are sent out, than, for 
Warrants to issue with Blanks, for Bailiffs to be inserted
afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes the Names of the special Bailiffs
are inserted in the Office.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I say, is it not oftner done? more 
frequently?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know but it may.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Counsel for the Crown.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you think it prudent, sometimes not
to send the Names of the special Bailiffs to the
Office? -- to conceal the Names till they are inserted
by the Attorney?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Fluit</font> , an Attorney in <font>Chester</font> , sworn.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Counsel for the Crown.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Did your Father ever act as Agent for the
Sheriff of this County?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it customary for your Father, to send
out Warrants with Blanks, for the Names of the
special Bailiffs to be inserted afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did leave Blanks often in the Warrants.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose you understood, that your Father
had Authority so to do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I always understood, that he had Authority
to do it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Counsel for the Prisoner.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Q.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But did your Father never refuse, to send
out blank Warrants, to your Knowledge?
<pagebreak id="40" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>A.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes; he sometimes did, when he suspected
the Attorney; but never, when he knew the 
Attorney to be a fair Practicer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Here ends the Evidence on behalf of the Crown.</font> </nonSpeech>
