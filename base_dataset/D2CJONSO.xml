fine Horse? a Lyon? a Bull? a Beare? a Dog, or a Cat? an 
excellent fine <font>Bartholmew-bird</font> ? or an Instrument? what is't you

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> S'lid! heere's <font>Orpheus</font> among the beasts, with his
Fiddle, and all!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>TRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you buy any comfortable bread, Gentlemen?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And <font>Ceres</font> selling her daughters picture, in
Ginger-worke!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That these people should be so ignorant to thinke vs
chapmen for 'hem! doe wee looke as if wee would buy
Ginger-bread? or Hobby-horses?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, they know no better ware then they haue, nor 
better customers then come. And our very being here makes vs fit 
to be demanded, as well as others. Would <font>Cokes</font> would come! 
there were a true customer for 'hem.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How much is't? thirty shillings? who's yonder! <font>Ned
Winwife</font> ? and <font>Tom Quarlous</font> , I thinke! yes, (gi' me it all) (gi'

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You may draw me to as likely an inconuenience, when

but to see sights, now.

will 
you take any froth, and smoake with vs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, but you'l pardon vs, if we knew not of so much
familiarity betweene vs afore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> As what, Sir?

<font>Vrsla's</font> mansion, how like you her bower? heere you may ha' your

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I had rather ha' my Punque, cold, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> There's for me, Punque! and Pigge!

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She calls within.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Moonecalfe</font> ? you Rogue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>MOO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> By and by, the bottle is almost off Mistresse, here
Master <font>Arthur</font> .   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le part you, and your play-fellow there, i' the garded
coat, an' you sunder not the sooner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Master <font>Win-wife</font> , you are proud (me thinkes) you doe 
not 
talke, nor drinke, are you proud?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not of the company I am in, Sir, nor the place, I assure
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You doe not except at the company! doe you? are you
in vapours, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>MOO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, good Master <font>Dan: Knockhum</font> , respect my Mistris
Bower, as you call it; for the honour of our Booth, none o' your
vapours, heere.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She comes out with a fire-brand.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, you thinne leane Polcat you, and they haue a 
minde to be i' their vapours, must you hinder 'hem? what did you
know Vermine, if they would ha' lost a cloake, or such a trifle?
must you be drawing the ayre of pacification heere? while I am
tormented, within, i' the fire, you Weasell?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>MOO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Mistresse, 'twas in the behalfe of your Booth's
credit, that I spoke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why? would my Booth ha' broake, if they had fal'ne 
out in't? Sir? or would their heate ha' fir'd it? in, you Rogue, and
wipe the pigges, and mend the fire, that they fall not, or I'le both 
baste and roast you, till your eyes drop out, like 'hem. (Leaue the
bottle behinde you, and be
curst a while.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Body o' the <font>Fayre</font> ! what's this? mother o' the Bawds?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she's mother o' the Pigs, Sir, mother o' the Pigs!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mother o' the <font>Furies</font> , I thinke, by her firebrand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, shee is too fat to be a <font>Fury</font> , sure, some      
walking 
Sow of tallow!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> An inspir'd vessell of Kitchin-stuffe!

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She drinkes this while.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> She'll make excellent geere for the Coach-makers, here 
in Smithfield, to anoynt wheeles and axell trees with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I, I, Gamesters, mocke a plaine plumpe soft wench o' 
the Suburbs, doe, because she's iuicy and wholesome: you must 
ha' your thinne pinch'd ware, pent vp i' the compasse of a
dogge-collar, (or 'twill not do) that lookes like a long lac'd       
<font>Conger</font> , set 
vpright, and a greene feather, like fennell i' the Ioll on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well said <font>Vrs</font> , my good <font>Vrs</font> ; to 'hem <font>Vrs</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is shee your quagmire, <font>Dan: Knockhum</font> ? is this your
Bogge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>NIG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall haue a quarrel presently.
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How? Bog? Quagmire? foule vapours! hum'h!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, hee that would venture for't, I assure him, might
sinke into her, and be drown'd a weeke, ere any friend hee had, 
could find where he were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And then he would be a fort'night weighing vp againe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twere like falling into a whole <font>Shire</font> of butter:   
they 
had need be a teeme of <font>Dutchmen</font> , should draw him out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Answer 'hem, <font>Vrs</font> , where's thy <font>Bartholmew-wit</font> ,  
now? 
<font>Vrs</font> , thy <font>Bartholmew-wit</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hang 'hem, rotten, roguy Cheaters, I hope to see 'hem
plagu'd one day (pox'd they are already, I am sure) with leane 
playhouse poultry, that has the boany rumpe, sticking out like the Ace
of Spades, or the point of a Partizan, that euery rib of 'hem is like 
the tooth of a Saw: and <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: aud</comment> will so grate 'hem with 
their hips, &amp;
shoulders, as (take 'hem altogether) they were as good lye with a    
hurdle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Out vpon her, how she drips! she's able to giue a man 
the sweating Sicknesse, with looking on her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mary looke off, with a patch o' your face; and a dosen 
i' your breech, though they be o' scarlet, Sir. I ha' seene as fine
outsides, as either o' yours, bring lowsie linings to the Brokers, ere
now, twice a weeke?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe you thinke there may be a fine new Cuckingstoole 
i' the <font>Fayre</font> , to be purchas'd? one large inough, I meane. I know 
there is a pond of capacity, for her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> For your mother, you Rascall, out you Rogue, you hedge
bird, you Pimpe, you pannier-mans bastard, you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe you sneere, you dogs-head, you <font>Trendle tayle</font> ! you
looke as you were begotten a' top of a Cart in haruest-time, when 
the whelp was hot and eager. Go, snuffe after your brothers bitch,
M=rs= <font>Commodity</font> , that's the Liuory you weare, 'twill be out at  
the 
elbows, shortly. It's time you went to't, for the to'ther remnant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Peace, <font>Vrs</font> , peace, <font>Vrs</font> , they'll kill the poore 
Whale, and 
make oyle of her. Pray thee goe in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I'le see 'hem pox'd first, and pil'd, and double pil'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Let's away, her language growes greasier then her Pigs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Dos't so, snotty nose? good Lord! are you sniueling? 
you were engendred on a she-begger, in a barne, when the bald
Thrasher, your Sire, was scarce warme.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray thee, let's goe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, faith: I'le stay the end of her, now: I know shee
cannot last long; I finde by her <font>similes</font> , shee wanes a pace.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do's shee so? I'le set you gone. Gi' mee my Pig-pan 
hither a little. I'le scald you hence, and you will not goe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen, these are very strange vapours! and very
idle vapours! I assure you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a very serious asse, wee assure you.
<pagebreak id="27" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Humh! Asse? and serious? nay, then pardon mee my 
vapour. I haue a foolish vapour, Gentlemen: any man that doe's 
vapour me, the Asse, Master <font>Quarlous</font> -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What then, Master <font>Iordan</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I doe vapour him the lye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, and to any man that vapours mee the lie, I doe
vapour that. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, then, vapours vpon vapours.

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Vrsla <font>comes in, with the scalding-pan. They fight. Shee falls with

run for some creame and sallad oyle, quickly. Are you 
vnder-peering, you Baboun? rip off my hose, an' you be men, men, men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>MOO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Runne you for some creame, good mother <font>Ione</font> . I'le

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Be of a good cheere, <font>Vrs</font> , thou hast hindred me the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>NIG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I faith, when the panne came, they had made you runne
else. (this had beene a fine time for purchase, if you had 
ventur'd.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not a whit, these fellowes were too fine to carry
money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nightingale</font> , get some helpe to carry her legge out  
o' the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>VRS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! the poxe, why doe you put me in minde o' my leg,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>KNO.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Patience, <font>Vrs</font> , take a good heart, 'tis but a

These are the fruites of the bottle-ale, and tabacco! the some of the
one, and the fumes of the other! Stay young man, and despise 
not the wisedome of these few hayres, that are growne gray in care 
of thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nightingale</font> , stay a little. Indeede I'le heare some 
o' 
this!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, <font>Numps</font> , come, where are you? welcome into 
the <font>Fayre</font> , Mistris <font>Grace</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> S'light, hee will call company, you shall see, and put vs 
into doings presently.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Thirst not after that frothy liquor, Ale: for, who knowes,
when hee openeth the stopple, what may be in the bottle? hath 
not a Snaile, a Spider, yea, a Neuft bin found there? thirst not 
after it, youth: thirst not after it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a braue fellow, <font>Numps</font> , let's heare him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> S'blood, how braue is he? in a garded coate? you were 
best trucke with him, e'en strip, and trucke presently, it will 
become you, why will you heare him, because he is an Asse, and may 
be a kinne <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: kinnne</comment> to the <font>Cokeses</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> O, good <font>Numps</font> !
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Neither doe thou lust after that tawney weede, tabacco.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Braue words!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose complexion is like the Indians that vents it!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are they not braue words, Sister?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And who can tell, if, before the gathering, and making
vp thereof, the <font>Alligarta</font> hath not piss'd thereon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Heart let 'hem be braue words, as braue as they will!
and they were all the braue words in a Countrey, how then? will 
you away yet? ha' you inough on him? Mistris <font>Grace</font> , come you
away, I pray you, be not you accessary. If you doe lose your 
Licence, or somewhat else, Sir, with listning to his fables: say,    
<font>Numps</font> ,
is a witch, with all my heart, doe, say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Avoyd i' your sattin doublet, <font>Numps</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The creeping venome of which subtill serpent, as some 
<pagebreak id="29" />
late writers affirme; neither the cutting of the perrillous plant, 
nor the drying of it, nor the lighting, or burning, can any way 
perssway, or asswage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Good, i' faith! is't not Sister?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hence it is, that the lungs of the Tabacconist are rotted,
the Liuer spotted, the braine smoak'd like the backside of the
Pig-womans Booth, here, and the whole body within, blacke, as her 
Pan, you saw e'en now, without.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A fine similitude, that, Sir! did you see the panne?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, the hole in the nose heere, of some tabacco-takers,
or the third nostrill, (if I may so call it) which makes, that they  
can 
vent the tabacco out, like the Ace of clubs, or rather the
Flower-de-lice, is caused from the tabacco, the meere tabacco! when  
the 
poore innocent pox, hauing nothing to doe there, is miserably, 
and most vnconscionably slander'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Who would ha' mist this, Sister?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>OVER.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Not any body, but <font>Numps</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> He do's not vnderstand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor you feele.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hee picketh his purse.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What would you haue, Sister, of a fellow that knowes
nothing but a basket-hilt, and an old Fox in't? the best musique 
i' the <font>Fayre</font> , will not moue a logge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> In, to <font>Vrsla, Nightingale</font> , and carry her comfort:   
see it 
told. This fellow was sent to vs by fortune, for our first fairing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But what speake I of the diseases of the body, children of 
the <font>Fayre</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That's to vs, Sister. Braue i' faith!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Harke, O, you sonnes and daughters of Smithfield! and
heare what mallady it doth the minde: It causeth swearing, it 
causeth swaggering, it causeth snuffling, and snarling, and now and
then a hurt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>OVE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> He hath something of Master <font>Ouerdoo</font> , mee thinkes,
brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So mee thought, Sister, very much of my brother
<font>Ouerdoo</font> : And 'tis, when he speakes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Looke into any Angle o' the towne, (the Streights, or the
<font>Bermuda's</font> where the quarrelling lesson is read, and how doe 
they entertaine the time, but with bottle-ale, and tabacco? The
Lecturer is o' one side, and his Pupils o' the other; But the seconds
are still bottle-ale, and tabacco, for which the Lecturer reads, and
the Nouices pay. Thirty pound a weeke in bottle-ale! forty in 
tabacco! and ten more in Ale againe. Then for a sute to drinke in, 
so much, and (that being slauer'd) so much for another sute, and 
then a third sute, and a fourth sute! and still the bottle-ale
slauereth, and the tabacco stinketh!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Heart of a mad-man! are you rooted heere? will           
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: well</comment> you

neuer away? what can any man finde out in this bawling fellow, 
to grow heere for? hee is a full handfull higher, sin' he heard him,
will you fix heere? and set vp a Booth? Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will conclude briefely --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold your peace, you roaring Rascall, I'le runne 
my head i' your chaps else. You were best build a Booth, and
entertaine him, make your Will, and you say the word, and him your
heyre! heart, I neuer knew one taken with a mouth of a pecke, 
afore. By this light, I'le carry you away o' my backe, and you will
not come.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>He gets him vp on pick-packe.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Stay <font>Numpes</font> , stay, set mee downe: I ha' lost my     
purse, 
<font>Numpes</font> , O my purse! one o' my fine purses is gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>OVER.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is't indeed, brother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I, as I am an honest man, would I were an errant Rogue,
else! a plague of all roguy, damn'd cut-purses for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Blesse 'hem with all my heart, with all my heart, do you

I will make no more orations, shall draw on these tragicall

collaterall Iustice, <font>Adam Ouerdoo</font> , deseru'd this beating; for I 
the said <font>Adam</font> , 
was one cause (a by-cause) why the purse was lost: and my wiues
brothers purse too, which they know not of yet. But I shall make
very good mirth with it, at supper, (that will be the sport) and put
my little friend, M=r= <font>Humphrey Wasp's</font> choler quite out of
countenance. When, sitting at the vpper end o' my Table, as I vse, &amp;

cudgell'd, and shew 'hem the marks. To see what bad euents may 
peepe out o' the taile of good purposes! the care I had of that ciuil
yong man, I tooke fancy to this morning, (and haue not left it yet)
drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company, indeede         
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: indeeede</comment> ,
which drew the cut-purse; which drew the money; which drew

drew on my beating: a pretty gradation! And they shall ha' it 
i' their dish, i' faith, at night for fruit: I loue to be merry at my
Table. I had thought once, at one speciall blow he ga' me, to haue
reuealed my selfe? but then (I thank thee fortitude) I remembred
that a wise man (and who is euer so great a part, o' the 
Common-wealth in himselfe) for no particular disaster ought to       
abandon a
publike good designe. The husbandman ought not for one
vnthankful yeer, to forsake the plough; The Shepheard ought not, for
one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not 
for one leake i' the poope, to quit the Helme; Nor the Alderman 
ought not for one custerd more, at a meale, to giue vp his cloake; 
The Constable ought not to breake his staffe, and forsweare the 
watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper o' the Parish            
<foreign> (Vt 
paruis componere magna solebam) </foreign> to put vp his pipes, for one rainy
Sunday. These are certaine knocking conclusions; out of which, 
I am resolu'd, come what come can, come beating, come
imprisonment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come
the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discouer who I am, till my 
due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I said euer, in Iustice

view the worke you ha' done, an' you be benefic'd at the Gallowes,
and preach there, thanke your owne handy-worke. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you shall take no pride in your preferment: you shall
be silenc'd quickly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What doe you meane? sweet buds of gentility.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To ha' my peneworths out on you: Bud. No lesse then
two purses a day, serue you? I thought you a simple fellow, 
when my man <font>Numpes</font> beate you, i' the morning, and pittied
you --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>OVE.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So did I, I'le be sworne, brother; but now I see hee is
a lewd, and pernicious Enormity: (as Master <font>Ouerdoo</font> calls
him.) 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>IVS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mine owne words turn'd vpon mee, like swords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Cannot a man's purse be at quiet for you, i' the Masters
pocket, but you must intice it forth, and debauch it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, Sir, keepe your debauch, and your fine
<font>Bartholmew-termes</font> to your selfe; and make as much on 'hem as you 
please. But
gi' me this from you, i' the meane time: I beseech you, see if I can

   <nonSpeech>COK.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, <font>Numps</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why? because you are an Asse, Sir, there's a reason
the shortest way, and you will needs ha' it; now you ha' got the
tricke of losing, you'ld lose your breech, an't 'twere loose. I know
you, Sir, come, deliuer, you'll goe and cracke the vermine, you
breed now, will you? 'tis very fine, will you ha' the truth on't?
they are such <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: snch</comment> retchlesse flies as you are,     
that blow cutpurses
abroad in euery corner; your foolish hauing of money, makes 'hem.
An' there were no wiser then I, Sir, the trade should lye open for
you, Sir, it should i' faith, Sir. I would teach your wit to come to
your head, Sir, as well as your land to come into your hand, I
assure you, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Alacke, good <font>Numps</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WAS.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Gentlemen, neuer pitty mee, I am not worth it:
Lord send me at home once, to <font>Harrow</font> o' the <font>Hill</font> againe, if I
trauell any more, call me <font>Coriat</font> ; with all my heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Stay, Sir, I must haue a word with you in priuate. Doe
you heare?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> With me, Sir? what's your pleasure? good Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe not deny it. You are a cutpurse, Sir, this 
Gentleman here, and I, saw you, nor doe we meane to detect you (though
we can sufficiently informe our selues, toward the danger of
concealing you) but you must doe vs a piece of seruice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Gentlemen, doe not vndoe me; I am a ciuill 
young man, and but a beginner, indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, your beginning shall bring on your ending, for vs. 
<pagebreak id="46" />
We are no Catchpoles nor Constables. That you are to vndertake,
is this; you saw the old fellow, with the blacke boxe, here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The little old Gouernour, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> That same: I see, you haue flowne him to a marke 
already. I would ha' you get away that boxe from him, and bring
it vs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Would you ha' the boxe and all, Sir? or onely that,
that is in't? I'le get you that, and leaue him the boxe, to play with
still: (which will be the harder o' the two) because I would gaine
your worships good opinion of me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN-W.</nonSpeech><dialogue> He sayes well, 'tis the greater Mastry, and 'twill make
the more sport when 'tis mist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I, and 'twill be the longer a missing, to draw on the
sport.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But looke you doe it now, sirrah, and keepe your
word: or --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>EDG.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, if euer I breake my word, with a Gentleman, may I
neuer read word at my need. Where shall I find you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Some-where i' the <font>Fayre</font> , heereabouts. Dispatch it
quickly. I would faine see the carefull foole deluded! of all Beasts,
I loue the serious Asse. He that takes paines to be one, and playes
the foole, with the greatest diligence that can be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you would not chose, Sir, but loue my Guardian,
Iustice <font>Ouerdoo</font> , who is answerable to that description, in euery
haire of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> So I haue heard. But how came you, Mistris              
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Mistis</comment> <font>Welborne</font> , 
to be his Ward? or haue relation to him, at first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, through a common calamity, he bought me, Sir;
and now he will marry me to his wiues brother, this wise
Gentleman, that you see, or else I must pay value o' my land
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> S'lid, is there no deuice of disparagement? or so? talke
with some crafty fellow, some picklocke o' the Law! Would I had
studied a yeere longer i' the Innes of Court, and't had beene but
i' your case.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN-W.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I Master <font>Quarlous</font> , are you proffering?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You'ld bring but little ayde, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN-W.</nonSpeech><dialogue> (I'le looke to you i' faith, Gamester.) An vnfortunate
foolish <font>Tribe</font> you are falne into, Lady, I wonder you can
endure 'hem.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, they cannot worke their fetters off; must weare
'hem.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WINW.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You see what care they haue on you, to leaue you thus.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith the same they haue of themselues, Sir. I cannot
greatly complaine, if this were all the plea I had against 'hem.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN.</nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis true! but will you please to withdraw with vs, a
little, and make them thinke, they haue lost you. I hope our
manners ha' beene such hitherto, and our language, as will giue
<pagebreak id="47" />
you no cause, to doubt your selfe, in our company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>GRA.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I will giue my selfe, no cause; I am so secure of   
mine
owne manners, as I suspect not yours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Looke where <font>Iohn Little-wit</font> comes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN-W.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Away, I'le not be seene, by him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, you were not best, hee'ld tell his mother, the
widdow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>WIN-W.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Heart <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Heatt</comment> , what doe you meane?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>QVAR.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Cry you mercy, is the winde there? must not the
widdow be nam'd?
