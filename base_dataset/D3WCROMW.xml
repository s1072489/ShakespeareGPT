<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: shop THE FIRST INSTEAD OF THE LAST WORD OF THE LINE</comment>
without Ludgate, and near thereunto, whether he
went on purpose to call the said <font>Dedd</font> to goe along with
him to <font>Bowe</font> to a Faire: And asking him whether he would
goe with him, he said, No, for that he had earnest business
in the afternoon; And this Examinate demanding of him
what that was, he asked him whether he heard no Newes;
The Examinate told him No: Who then said, That there
was very great news, which he would disclose to him this
Examinate, if he would keep it secret; and that they would
be made Men if it went forward; which this Examinate
having promised to doe, the said <font>Dodd</font> acquainted him, That
<font>Francis Fox</font> , an Apprentice in Pater-Noster-rowe at the
Globe, and one <font>Sommerset Fox</font> , with severall others, were
to have a Meeting at the Bell-Savage on Ludgate-Hill 
towards Fleet-bridge, about the business: And the
Examinate asking him what business, after making some further
difficulty about the revealing of it: He said, <font>That they had
resolved to Murther the Protector and his Councill, and
then to proclaim</font> Charls Stuart <font>King of England</font> . And this
Examinate then asking him, What strength they had to
doe it with; He answered, That many thousands had
already engaged in it, and that there were Meetings upon
severall parts of this Town, and that the Outparts of the
City, and Temple-Bar were made sure; and that nothing
more remained but to effect the same in the City: And
for the Guards, they intended to seize upon the Forces in
the Mewes, Tower, Whitehall, and St James, all at once;
and said, That some of the Protectors Guard were false to
him, and that most of the Nobility of England was engaged
in it, and that there was a Prisoner came out of the Tower
every night, and went in again at his pleasure, and spoke as
<pagebreak id="26" />
if some Souldiers in the Tower would joyn with them:
And so the said <font>Dodd</font> invited the Examinate to meet them
at the place aforesaid, which he told them, He would, and
had before promised him to engage in this business.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Examinate further saith, That he did not meet
with them that night: But meeting with the said <font>Dodd</font>
upon Saturday after, he told the Examinate, That they met
again upon the Sabbath day at the place aforesaid, where
the Examinate met them, and there was present <font>Dodd</font> ,
<font>Sommerset Fox</font> , and three others, one whereof they called
<font>Gerard</font> ; but they not being suffer'd to goe in there, becaus
it was the Lords day, they went up the street together, and
told the Examinate, That they heard the <font>Gerards</font> were
apprehended, but said, They were not concerned in that
business, however they would desist, untill they saw how the
<font>Gerards</font> came off: and then said, If the business goe on,
they would rather then not do it, set the City on fire to
quell the Trained Bands, and then march for Scotland.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, That he going through
Pater-Noster-Rowe, <font>Francis Fox</font> called him to him, and
asked him if there was no news; and the Examinate
answering,</nonSpeech><dialogue> No; </dialogue><nonSpeech>he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you not heard that my Cousin
<font>Gerard</font> was put upon the Rack in the Tower; </dialogue><nonSpeech>he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> No:
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fox</font> replyed, That there was none of their Company yet
discovered.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He further saith, That the persons told him, that the
Countreys would joyn with them, and that the Forces here
were now very few, there being now but 5000 in England;
and that they should be assisted out of France and Holland,
and that one <font>Gerard</font> was lately come out of France.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <font>THE EXAMINATION OF</font> JOHN JONES <font>APOTHECARY, TAKEN BY US</font>
EDWARD WHALEY <font>AND</font> HENRY MIDDLETON, <font>ESQUIRES;
THE 21 OF MAY</font> , 1654.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>This Examinate saith, That about <font>Thursday</font> or
<font>Friday</font> Sevennight, Dr. <font>Hynton</font> told him, that there
was a plot against the Lord Protector; upon which
this Examinate saith, That he gave such an Answer to the
Doctor, as that he did not seem to dislike it, probably he
might say,</nonSpeech><dialogue> very well; </dialogue><nonSpeech>or, that it might put an end to the
business, but doth not perfectly remember the particular
words.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Upon <font>Saturday</font> morning following, this Examinate met
with one <font>Tudor</font> a Chyrurgion, at an Ale-house near to his
own House; and after they were gone from thence, this
Examinate asked <font>Tudor</font> , what news, saying, that there was
a talk up and down the Town of a design against the Lord
Protector (which news he saith he had from the Doctor)
<font>Tuder</font> answered, There was such a thing, that <font>Giles Paulet</font>
had enformed the Lord Protector, that <font>Jack Gerard</font> would
cut the Lord Protectors throat where ever he met him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate saith, that as he remembers, he spake
words to this purpose, That he thought none would be so
valiant as to do it. Whereupon <font>Tuder</font> answered, If it were
come to that, he believed he should go as far as any. Upon
which this Examinate did acquaint the Doctor what <font>Tuder</font>
had said. Whereupon the Doctor and this Examinate
believed that <font>Tuder</font> might be the man that might do it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Upon the foresaid <font>Saturday</font> , and upon the same
discourses, when they were speaking of the things aforesaid,
this Examinate told <font>Tuder</font> , he heard <font>Philips</font> was come to
Town. <font>Tuder</font> cryed,</nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord, where is he, I have great
business with him. </dialogue><nonSpeech>This Examinate replyed, he could not
tell, but he would ask the Doctor, if he knew; and would
inform him when he next met him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, That upon <font>Munday</font>
<pagebreak id="28" />
morning he met <font>Tuder</font> accidentally in <font>Castle-yard</font> near        
<font>Chancery
Lane</font> ; and this Examinate desired him that he would go
along with him to see one of his Patients, which he did;
and it being an Inn where the Patient lay, they went into a
room, and called for a cup of bear. This Examinate, as
he best remembers, asked <font>Tuder</font> what became of the
business? Who answered, That it might easily have been done
on <font>saturday</font> , or words near to that purpose; for as he was
coming along the Mill-bank he saw the Lord Protector in
a pair of Oars; with little company, and admired that a
Person of so great concernment should go so slenderly
guarded.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, On <font>Tuesday</font> morning
following, <font>Tuder</font> came to him, and askt him whether he had
learnt of the Doctor where <font>Philips</font> lay. Who answered,
he had askt the Doctor, but he would not tell.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate farther saith, that about <font>Thursday</font> or
<font>Friday</font> before his discourse with <font>Tuder</font> . Doctor <font>Hynton</font>
told this Examinate, speaking of the foresaid Design, that
Col: <font>Philips</font> was in Town. He asked him where he was,
the Doctor swore, By God he could not tell.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, That on <font>Saturday</font>
sevennight in the afternoon he met with one Capt. <font>Morley</font> and
Mr. <font>Hill</font> , whose wife is a Laundress to her Highness, they
went and drunk together; and speaking of the affairs of
<font>Scotland</font> , <font>Morley</font> said, it was the opinion of <font>Massey</font> and
<font>Bunce</font> , when he was beyond the sea, that the taking off
the Lord Protector would be more to the business then the
killing of many thousands of men.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, That on <font>Thursday</font> night
coming along the street about <font>Covent-Garden</font> , he was
telling Mr. <font>Hill</font> of the business, but Mr. <font>Hill</font> seemed to
slight it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, That meeting Com: Gen.
<font>Jay</font> , he spake to him as to Mr. <font>Hill</font> . Who answered, if he
should acquaint the Lord Protector with it, he should have
a reward, but he thought none durst do it, without it were
the Woodman, meaning <font>Brown</font> .</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="29" />
   <nonSpeech>This Examinate further saith, That he likewise spoke to
one <font>Palmer</font> a Taylor living about Charing-cross, the same
things as he did to Mr <font>Hill</font> , but he made light of it, and
said it was impossible. And this Examinate doth protest
in the presence of God, to his best remembrance, he
knoweth nothing more; but if any thing more shall occur to his
memory, he shall declare it.</nonSpeech>

 <head> <font>THE INFORMATION OF</font> SAMUEL WILDE <font>OF PUDDING-LANE,
LONDON, MAY 29.</font> 1654.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Vpon Thursday was sevennight this Informant was at
<font>Bowe-Fair</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS IN SOURCE TEXT FOR Fair</comment> , where he met  
with one Mr <font>John Man</font> a
Scrivener at Turners-Hall in <font>Philpot-lane</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> He askt me how
I did, and what news, and if I heard nothing. I answered
him, No, not I, but what concerned my Lord Mayor, who
was abused in the Streets. He said, Did I hear nothing
else? I told him, No: He said to me, He could tell me
something that was very sad; <font>Of a wicked Plot which was
against my Lord Protector and his Councill</font> , and all that did
adhere to him, <font>with an intention to murther my Lord and
his Council</font> . I asked him, Where he heard that news; He
answered, That an acquaintance of his did relate to him
this news that he told me: and moreover said, That if he
would comply with them in their Designe, then he should
know the full of the business; for they had met once
together at the Bell-Savage in Fleetstreet, and that they were
to meet again the next Sabbath-day; and if he would then
come into Holborn, he should hear the full of their
proceedings. Mr <font>Man</font> met five of the Company in the street,
and demanded of them where they would goe; They
looking about them, being timerous and fearfull, said, They
could get in at no place to be entertained, by reason of my
Lord Mayors proclamation for keeping the Sabbath, which
was so strict, they could not be entertained any where, and
therefore put it off till the Tuesday after, which was the
<pagebreak id="30" />
Thanksgiving day. But in the interim, they hearing that
some were taken, they were fearfull who they should be:
But yet they said they were none of their Company,
notwithstanding they would desist awhile.
   Afterwards Mr <font>Man</font> met with some of that Company,
and askt of them what news, and they answered, None
but only this, That those that were taken, pleaded ignorance
for what was demanded of them; But for their parts, they
were none of their Company, and they feared but one, who
was <font>Francis Fox</font> , living at the Globe in Pater-Noster-row,
because he was timerous and fearfull, and he would disclose
all if he should be taken. He is Kinsman to one Col: <font>Fox</font> ,
as also to Col: <font>John Gerard</font> who is in the Tower.
   This day Mr <font>Man</font> going through Pater-Noster-Rowe,
one <font>Fox</font> called him to him, and askt him if he heard no
news; Mr <font>Man</font> made slight of it, and answered, None. <font>Fox</font>
said, Have you not heard my Cousin <font>Gerard</font> was put upon a
Rack in the Tower; He said, No, he heard no such matter.
<font>Fox</font> replyed, That there was none of their Company yet
discovered: by which it appears that the said <font>Fox</font> was the
same mentioned formerly by the Hosier.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Informer further saith, That Mr <font>Man</font> further
informed him, that the Hosier acquainted him, That most of
the Nobility of the Land were in this Plot, and some of his
Highness Guard: And further said, That they had a fit
opportunity to take their advantage by reason the Guards
were weakned, and the Souldiery sent away for <font>Scotland</font> ,
and more were to be sent for <font>Holland</font> and <font>France</font> , and they
had a List of the strength of the Army: also, that they had
or were to have assistance out of <font>France</font> . He further said,
That <font>Dodd</font> the Hosier told him, that one <font>Gerard</font> was lately
come out of <font>France</font> .</nonSpeech>

Tunn or three Tunns in <font>Thames-street</font> in
<font>Peters-Pauls-Wharf</font> at a Chandlers shop over against the Church,  
and
told him that there was a designe against the Lord
<font>Protector</font> and this present Government, and divers Gentlemen
were engaged in it, and that three, or 4000 men were listed
already to that purpose; that they intended to make an
attempt upon the <font>Lord Protectors</font> person either at Dinner,
or as he went to <font>Hampton-Court</font> , and at the same time
would surprize the Guards at <font>Whitehall</font> , which he said
was easy to doe, in respect they had but one Match lighted
upon the Guard, and before they could light the rest they
would dispatch their business there. At the same time the
Portcullis should be shut down, and then <font>Charles</font> the
second, meaning <font>Charles Stuart</font> should be proclaimed.
And the Examinate asking him who should doe it, the
said <font>Barnes</font> told him that one <font>Wharton</font> who dwelt in

to a Horse, and Armes, and six pounds in money. And the
Examinate being askt what the reason was, why the said
<font>Barnes</font> should acquaint him with this design, saith, that
as he conceives it was because he had bin formerly in
Armes for the late King. And being demanded of him,
who was present at this discourse, saith, that no person else
was present, but that the said <font>Wharton</font> was with them a little
before, and that when the said <font>Wharton</font> went forth from

   <nonSpeech>That the said <font>Hudson</font> inquired of him how strong
the Guards were, and told him that this Examinate
and his Comrade should have notice when they were
ready, and that their worke should be to get as many as
they could, who were Souldiers together, under colour
of drinking, and when they begun their business, they
should likewise fall on, and cry out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now is your

   <nonSpeech>That <font>Hudson</font> did also inquire of him, how strong

</dialogue> <head> <font>THE EXAMINATION OF</font> EDWARD HUDSON, <font>TAKEN THE 24 OF
IUNE</font> 1654 <font>UPON OATH, BEFORE</font> WILLIAM GOFF <font>ESQ, IUSTICE
OF THE PEACE IN THE CITY OF</font> WESTMINSTER. <font>WHICH AT HIS
REQUEST WAS READ BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF IUSTICE</font> .</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Who saith, That he knows nothing further
concerning Major <font>Henshaws</font> going for <font>France</font> , then
he hath set down in his former <font>Examination</font> ,
but after <font>Henshaw</font> was returned, he came to this Examinate
and told him the Discourse he had with Prince <font>Rupert</font> ;
which was to this effect, That he propounded to the Prince
that he was able to destroy the Protector and his Forces
about the City of <font>London</font> with five hundred Horse; and
that he would be able to raise those Horse to effect it
with: That having propounded it to the Prince, he was
carryed to <font>Charls Stuart</font> , whom they call the King,
and that the Examinate propounded the same thing to
<pagebreak id="60" />
him, and was with him twice about it; but the said
<font>Charls Stuart</font> (as the said <font>Henshaw</font> told him) answered,
That he thought not that Designe feasible. Secondly,
that if it were discovered, and did fail, it would be
dishonorable. And thirdly, he was not then ready to second
it; but said, That Prince <font>Rupert</font> and he did agree upon
it, and that he came over by agreement with him to
execute it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Being demanded of the Examinate, What meetings he
had with <font>Henshaw</font> , and any other persons about this
Design; and by what means, and in what way it should be
executed, saith,</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That he never spake with any persons about the said
Design, but with the said <font>Henshaw, John Wiseman</font> , and
<font>Peter Vowell</font> of <font>Islington</font> , Schoolmaster; and with
<font>Hippon</font> and <font>Copley</font> two Souldiers in the Protectors own
Regiment. That <font>Henshaw</font> did acquaint him first with it,
and the first time that he acquainted him with it, was
upon <font>Henshaws</font> return from <font>France</font> , which was about the
beginning of Easter Term last; and then having 
acquainted him with what past in <font>France</font> , as before he hath
exprest, he told him, That he would goe about it, and
doubted not but he should in one Fortnight get a very
considerable body; and said, That there were many
Cavaliers in Town, who would be ready to joyn in it; and
for the secret carriage of it, they would never speak but
two together, and yet should be able to communicate their
mindes to all their friends; or words to this effect.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That some little time after, he came to this Examinate,
and told him, That he had been about his business, and
spoke with severall persons concerning it, and said, That
some relished it very well, and others hesitated, but he
did not doubt but to carry it on; and so he continued to
come to the Lodgings of the Examinate, and told the
Examinate, That they had agreed to attempt the Lord
Protector as he went to <font>Hampton Court</font> , and there to
seize upon his person; but afterward <font>Henshaw</font> told him,
<pagebreak id="61" />
That they doubted that would be a difficult work; and
besides, the Protector might get away himself, though
they should beat his party, and he was the chief person
they aimed at, and therefore they were upon
consideration of other ways; and then spake of seizing upon the
City, and of a Force they would get there: They spake
also of falling upon the Foot when they were mustering,
which they thought they might doe, by getting their
body of Horse into the form of a Regiment with Colors,
and so go to the Protectors Foot as friends, and then at
unawares fall upon them, and so march with Drum and
Colours to Whitehall. And that if any of these wayes
took, they would set up Major-Generall <font>Brown</font> in the
head of them, because of his relation to, and influence
upon the City; and thought they might engage him by a
Letter from <font>Charls Stuart</font> , which they would have ready:</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He further saith, That the said <font>Henshaw</font> did ask him
whether he the Examinate knew of any persons that would
engage in it; whereto the Examinate answered, That he
knew one; who was a very sober, honest, discreet man,
which was the said Mr <font>Peter Vowel</font> , but did not know
whether he would engage; whereupon the said <font>Henshaw</font>
desired he might be tryed, and accordingly, when the said
<font>Vowell</font> came to this Examinates Lodgings, as he often did,
the Examinate did propound it to him; who at first did
disrelish it as a thing not feasible, but afterwards he
speaking with <font>Henshaw</font> himself, the said <font>Vowell</font> did consent to
be an Actor in it; and saith, That the said <font>Henshaw</font> and
<font>Vowell</font> met at this Examinates lodgings about six times
after this, where they and this Examinate had often debate
about the said Design, and which way to accomplish it, and
speaking of persons to be engaged in it; the said <font>Vowel</font> said
he had a good friend, which he would carry <font>Henshaw</font> to, if
he pleased, but did not then name the man; but the
Examinate perceived afterwards that it was one Cap. <font>Billingsley</font> a
Butcher living in <font>Smithfield</font> , &amp; <font>Henshaw</font> told the Examinat
afterward, that they had spoken with him, &amp; that he would
be a considerable person, and able to raise 20 Horse, and
many Foot.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="62" />
   <nonSpeech>And being once in discourse about the said Designe,
<font>Vowell</font> said, That there was a Guard of Horse at
<font>Islington</font> , which were to be seized; Major <font>Henshaw</font> asked
How many there were of them; but the Examinate
remembers not what Answer was made thereto: but
<font>Henshaw</font> said, That they might be seized easily now they were
at Grass, and Riders might be set upon them: whereupon
<font>Vowell</font> said, that <font>Billingsley</font> would be able to provide men
enough to take them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Examinate further saith, that he had discourse with
the said <font>Hippon</font> and <font>Copley</font> about the said design, to the
effect of what he hath set down in his former
Examination. He further saith, that <font>John Wiseman</font> was
sometimes in the Room when these matters were in discourse.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further saith, that <font>Henshaw, Vowell</font> , and <font>Wiseman</font>
being together with this Examinate in his Lodgings, after
<font>Gerard</font> was taken;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well </dialogue><nonSpeech> (saith <font>Henshaw</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> none of my
party is yet discovered, and the Design may yet goe on:
Yes </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Vowell</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that it may, but the people will be much
discouraged. </dialogue><nonSpeech>He saith also, that he heard <font>Henshaw</font> speak
of Colonell <font>Finch</font> to be engaged in this Design.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That the said <font>Henshaw</font> told him, that the Duke of <font>York</font>
would be in <font>England</font> in August with 10000 men, of
<font>French, English, Scotch</font> , and <font>Irish</font> ; which he said was a
great secret; and that they intended to land at <font>Rye</font> , or in
some other place in <font>Sussex</font> . He saith, <font>Henshaw</font> did frame
the Libell posted up after <font>Gerard</font> was taken.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Examinate being Sworn, and then asked whether
the contents of this Paper were true in substance, confessed
that it was, according to the best of his remembrance.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Saith, That about the beginning of <font>May</font> , or later end of
<font>Aprill</font> last, he was at the house of one <font>Dayle</font> an
Innekeeper in <font>Leather-lane</font> , in company with his brother
<font>Henshaw</font> , and one <font>Peter Vowell</font> the Schoolmaster of           
<font>Islington</font> ,
and <font>Tuder</font> a Chyrurgian; and that whilst they were there,
the said <font>Henshaw, Vowell</font> , and <font>Dayle</font> the Innkeeper went
out of the Room into the Garden, and had conference
there together a quarter of an hour, and then came again
into the Room: whereupon <font>Vowell</font> went away, and the
rest sate down together. And this Examinate then asking
<pagebreak id="82" />
<font>Henshaw</font> who that other man was, he said, it was <font>Peter
Vowell</font> a Schoolmaster of <font>Islington</font> , who had directed him
to <font>Dayle</font> the Innkeeper, to engage him, and who had
<font>engaged to beat the Guards at that end of the Town</font> :</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That afterwards he met with the said <font>Vowell</font> and
<font>Henshaw</font> at one Doctor <font>Hudsons</font> in the <font>Old Baily</font> , two or
three times before the Plot was discovered, where the said
<font>Hudson, Henshaw</font> , and <font>Vowell</font> had private Conference 
together, and (as this Examinate believes) it was about the
Plot, his Brother <font>Henshaw</font> telling him as much: and that
the reason why this Examinate was not admitted to the
conference there, was, because <font>Vowell</font> would not be
perswaded to <font>speak about the Plot before any more company,
because it might not be known that he had a hand in it</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That upon Sunday, the next day after the Plot was

at the said Doctor <font>Hudsons</font> , where also was the said <font>Vowel</font> ,
and they there discoursed again together as formerly in

<font>Henshaw</font> when he had bin at Doctors Commons to speak
with Major <font>Baily</font> , whereto he answered, That he had bin
there twice the day before, but had not spoken with
him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That he was often at <font>Hudsons</font> with his Brother
<font>Henshaw</font> , and that <font>Hudson</font> would ask him what became of the
business, and when he had been with <font>Vowell</font> , and <font>Baily</font> ,
and Capt. <font>Billingsley</font> a Butcher; and  <font>Henshaw</font> would
answer him, That it went on very well; and saith, That
his Brother <font>Henshaw</font> had told him, That the said
Butcher was fully engaged in it, and would be able to
<pagebreak id="83" />
provide Two hundred men and more; and said, That one
day when he thought the business was to be done, he
came forth with some Horse and Foot as farr as
<font>Pickadilly</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He further saith, that some few dayes after the Plot
was discovered, he went with <font>Henshaw</font> to <font>Islington</font> to the
said <font>Vowel</font> , and found him at his house, from whence they
went together to drink their mornings Draught: And the
said <font>Henshaw</font> and <font>Vowell</font> speaking some words together,
<font>Vowell</font> said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>If none of your party be discovered within
this Fortnight, there will be men enough to fall into all
the Quarters of the Town</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>meaning</font> (as the Examinate
conceives) <font>for carrying on the aforesaid Design</font> : And
<font>Henshaw</font> then said, That there were <font>severall Regiments</font> both
of Horse and Foot in the severall parts of the Nation <font>to
rise</font> so soon as the stroke was struck here in <font>London</font> , <font>Which</font>
Vowell <font>said would be very well, and would be a thing
very easily done</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He saith further, That when they were last together
at Doctor <font>Hudsons, Henshaw</font> gave to <font>Vowell</font> some of the
Libels mentioned in his other Examination, which <font>Vowell</font>
said, He would dispose of.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He further saith, That he went with his Brother
<font>Henshaw</font> and <font>John Gerard</font> to the house of one <font>Minors</font> ,
dwelling in <font>Lambeth</font> in a little Garden-house, and there the
said <font>Gerard</font> and <font>Henshaw</font> told him of their Design to <font>fall
upon the Protector as he went abroad</font> , and also to seize
upon the Guards, and <font>asked him if he would joyne with
him</font> , which he <font>consented to doe</font> ; and said, He would be
ready at a days warning, when they should desire it: And
that there were other meetings between <font>Henshaw</font> and the
said <font>Minors</font> , and the said <font>Minors</font> did also meet with         
<font>Tuder</font> 
upon this business.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>That <font>Minors</font> further said, That a person (whose name
he this Examinate remembers not) having lost the Heel
of his Shooe, said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> What? will you not give me a Naile
to fasten my heel, who am one that am to redeem you?
<pagebreak id="84" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>and therefore he did fear the Plot might be
discovered:</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>He further saith, that there are two Souldiers, one
called <font>Copley</font> , the other <font>Hippon</font> , in the Lord Protectors
Regiment (as he hath heard) who did often frequent Doctor
<font>Hudsons</font> lodging, and <font>Henshaws</font> company, and believeth
that both of them had knowledge of the said Design; for
that <font>Copley</font> said a day or two before the <font>Gerards</font> were
taken, to <font>Hudson</font> , that the Regiment was drawn into the
Park, when he expected the City would have come down;
and if they had, he being Sentinell was ready, which he
conceives, was to have assisted the City; and for that (as
<font>Henshaw</font> told this Examinate) the said <font>Copley</font> and <font>Hippon</font>
gave constant intelligence to Doctor <font>Hudson</font> , what was
done in the Guards at <font>Whitehall</font> , and what prisoners
were brought in; and when this Examinate was upon the
Guard, the said <font>Hippon</font> acquainted this Examinate
privately, that he had told Doctor <font>Hudson</font> of his
Imprisonment.</nonSpeech>
