 <head>A
DIALOGUE, &amp;C.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Gent.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. --, I sent for you,
to consult in what Fund
it will be most proper
to lay out some
Money, that I have just
now received of the
Legacy left me by my Uncle, Mr. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Broker.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a great Pity, Sir, you did
not receive it two or three Months ago,
the Stocks being of late considerably risen
upon the Preliminaries settled between the
Emperor and the King of <font>France</font> ; and,
without doubt, will be higher when they
are published, provided there is nothing
in them like what is reported about the
Secret Articles.
<pagebreak id="12" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what may they be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B. Here he whispered in the Gentleman's
Ear, so that I cannot tell what he said, only
in the Conclusion I heard him say --</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But
no-body will believe it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor can I believe it; therefore let
us confine ourselves to the Point, What is
the most proper thing to lay out some 
Money in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>India</font> Stock against the World; and
you may believe I advise you as a Friend,
since I speak against my Interest; for
should you lay out your Money in any
other Fund, my Brokage would come to
more, because it would buy more
Capital.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were wont to exclaim against
that Stock as a Bubble, and was for your
Solids, as you call them: How comes it,
that you have thus altered your
Opinion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For a very good Reason; because
there is a Scheme going forward in it,
which cannot fail succeeding, it being
calculated as well for the Good of the
Publick, as for the Benefit of the Company;
and therefore when it comes before
Parliament, will surely be approved: Upon
which moral Certainty I have invested
my little Capital in the said Stock, and
have persuaded several of my Friends,
<pagebreak id="13" />
that had Money by them, to lay it out
therein; and such of them as had not, I
borrowed it for them at Interest, upon
Security of the same Stock: There are a
great many other Gentlemen (that were
early in the Secret) that have done the
same for very large Parcels. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Here he
mentioned several Persons Names, which I do
not repeat, as improper, and, to my
Purpose, unnecessary.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you are not under Promise of
Secrecy, pray open the said Scheme to me,
that I may give you my Thoughts
upon it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I will with all my heart, and
debate it with you too, Sir, for 'tis now
no Secret. The Case, in a few Words,
is no more than this: -- The Company
is to apply this next Sessions to Parliament
for some Regulation or Reduction of the
Duties that are payable upon Teas, which,
as the Law at present stands, are so very
great, as to tempt the smuggling very
large Parcels of that Commodity; and as
it carries with it that popular Intention
of preventing that iniquitous Practice, so
prejudicial to the Fair Trader, there is
no room left to doubt but that Success
will attend such Application.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And is it thought that the
Parliament will gratify the Company, without
turning this Thing also to the Advantage
of the Nation?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Nation will be greatly Gainers
by it, because if Smuggling be effectually
prevented, by lowering the Excise, of
consequence more Tea will pay the said
Duty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's begging the Question, and
that I can't grant, nor I believe will that
august Assembly; because it seems a
Paradox, that lessening the Duty should be
the Means of bringing in larger Sums
upon the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Experience hath demonstrated it in
other Commodities; as Spices, Cocoa
Nuts, &amp;c.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say any thing to that, only
that what happens to be the Case in one
Commodity, may not prove so in
another; therefore it is very probable, that
the Parliament will turn this Project
to a certain National Advantage, by
reducing the Company's Annuity to 3 <font>per
Cent.</font> for by that the Nation will be sure
to save 32000 <font>l.</font> a Year; and if the
Company will get that yearly Sum by
their Scheme, is with me Matter of
Doubt.
<pagebreak id="15" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am amazed, Sir, at your Doubt!
tho' should the Parliament make the
Company pay such Tribute for such an
Act (which, by-the-by, there is a Chance
they won't) it will be the best Bargain
the Company ever made, for they'll get
thrice that Sum annually by it, as you may
see by the <font>Daily Advertiser</font> of the 9th of
<font>December</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't give Credit to every thing
that's printed, any more than I do to
every thing that's said; it may be so, or may
not be; 'tis at best but a Chance, till
tried. We will let this Point rest for the
present, and now talk a little about the
State of the Company, that I may, if
possible, come at the intrinsick Value of
their Stock. Know you what Sum in
Bonds they have out-standing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is, without Exception, the
most difficult Question you could ask, to
meet with a satisfactory Answer: I own
I am not able to resolve it with Certainty,
being informed it is a Secret known to but
few of the D--rs; but by general
Report they are supposed to have as many as
they are (by their Charter or Act of
Parliament) permitted to issue, <font>viz.</font> to the
Amount of their Capital, which is about
3,200,000 <font>l.</font>
<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard so before; and some
People think there is that Sum out in the
three and half <font>per Cent.</font> Bonds, over and
above between 4 or 500, 000 <font>l.</font> (at which
the Company's Forts and Castles are
valued) in 3 <font>per Cent.</font> Bonds, besides
sometimes considerable Sums in Loan of the
<font>Bank of England</font> : The Truth of these
two last Articles I much doubt, and may
have been given out formerly by your
<font>'Change-Alley</font> Bears (when such were
tolerated) to depreciate the said Stock: But
upon supposing only the former, we shall
find this Point brought into a very narrow
Compass, <font>viz.</font> what the Government owes
to the Company for their Fund, we'll
suppose they owe to their Bond
Creditors; and of course the Stock Proprietors
have nothing for what they buy, but the
Company's Effects in Trade, and their
Charter: And do you think these Articles
worth above five Millions <font>Sterling</font> , which
the whole Capital comes to at the present
Market Price?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I agree with you there, Sir, and may
be they have not half the Sum in Trade,
and possibly they would not distribute
100 <font>l. Sterling</font> for 100 <font>l.</font> Capital, were
they now to break up; and that all the
rest, and may be more, is <font>Premio</font> given
for the probable Advantages of the
<pagebreak id="17" />
exclusive Trade for the Term of thirty Years
to come: But few People make such a
nice Scrutiny into the <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: the the</comment> State of the
Company as you; and rather believe,
for the generality, that the Capital due
from the Government, and also the Stock
in Trade, are both the sole Property of
the Proprietors.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For this very Reason I am of
Opinion, that when the Company comes
before the Parliament (who constantly
endeavoured to prevent the Unwary being
misled) they will immediately reduce the
Annuity payable to the Company to 3 <font>per
Cent.</font> and will apply the Produce of the
Sinking Fund (as soon as the same shall be
at Liberty) to pay off entirely the said
Company's Fund, and to compel them to
discharge therewith the whole Bond Debt
(if they can, if not, as far as it will go)
that the true Amount thereof may no
longer be a Mystery; and the Purchasers of
the said Stock will then know, that they
give so much (whatever be the Price) only
for the Effects in Hand, and Liberty of
the Trade.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All what you have said may be very
reasonable, and perhaps may come to
pass; but I verily believe no body thinks
of it but yourself, and therefore you may
venture now with a seeming very good
<pagebreak id="18" />
Prospect, and get out again with Profit
time enough, even before the Scheme is
brought into Parliament, and let the
Devil take the hindmost; for 'tis
remarkable, that the Expectation of any Scheme
hath, for the generality, greater
Influence on the Stocks, than its
Accomplishment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't intend to lay out my Money
for a Job only, but with a View to live
upon the Income or Dividend (of such
Fund as I shall now invest it in. And 
therefore, considering all our Debate, 
together with the Precariousness and
Uncertainty of their Dividend (the Company
being rivalled in Trade by all the
Maritime Powers) I am determined not to be
concerned in their Stock, but leave it
entirely to those that are constantly upon the
Spot, and know when are the proper
Times to get in or out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have told you, Sir, my Opinion;
and, since you do not think well of <font>India</font>
Stock at this Price, am ready to obey
your Orders in any other Fund, that may
be more to your Satisfaction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you of <font>Bank</font> Stock?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Old Women and Foreigners are very
fond of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why are they so?
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe because they are very well
satisfied with the Management of the
Directors.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You might have added some other
Reasons; such as, because they were
never guilty of Exceedings in Dividends;
and because they have no Bonds against
them carrying the Canker of Interest, they
being Money-lenders, and not Borrowers;
and because --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There may be a great many good
Reasons more: But you was pleased to
object against the great <font>Premium</font> given
upon purchasing <font>India</font> Stock, whose exclusive
Charter hath upwards of thirty Years to
run: Will not the same Objection lie
against the <font>Premium</font> given for <font>Bank</font> Stock,
since theirs expires so soon as the Year
1742?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis so most certainly; and
therefore I'll let that Stock alone also. Pray
give me your Thoughts upon the
<font>South-Sea</font> Stock
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I really believe it is in a
flourishing Condition, which is greatly owing to
the Frugality and Application of the
present Set of Directors, who have
restored the Company's Credit, by putting
their Trade under good Regulations,
and lessened very considerably the Bond 
Debt.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what may be the Sum that the
Company actually owe?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> According to the Account laid
before the General Court in <font>July</font> last (the
Veracity of which is not to be question'd)
only about 650,000 <font>l.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How much is that <font>per Cent.</font> upon
their Capital?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As near as I can compute about 17
<font>per Cent.</font> but they have more than that
Sum due to them in <font>New Spain</font> , upon
Account of old Dependencies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have formerly heard much Talk of
those old Debts, but believe what of them
were good have (by the indefatigable
Pains taken by the present Directors)
been e'er now recovered; and for the Sum
still out-standing I look upon it only as a
Cypher; and the more, because I have
heard in Conversation, the K-- of <font>S--</font>
hath such large Demands upon the
Company, as would swallow up that Sum, or
more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis true the K-- of <font>S--</font> doth
make some Demands upon the Company,
and so doth the Company upon the K--
of <font>S--</font> ; but no Mortal can tell when
they will be adjusted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I declare I am for something clear of
all Incumbrances, as well present as
future; therefore cannot resolve to lay out
<pagebreak id="21" />
my Money in this Stock neither: Besides,
considering that 17 <font>per Cent.</font> ought to be
deducted out of the Capital to make it
whole, that brings it down to 83; and to
give the present Market Price for it, is
equal to the buying 3 <font>per Cent. Annuities</font>
at 112.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are so very nice, Sir, that I
don't know what you can do with your
Money. You must e'en lay it out in the
<font>South-Sea</font> Annuities, since the Trading
Companies don't please you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't think I shall do that either,
because I have seen a Scheme for a general
Reduction of the Funds to 3 <font>per Cent.</font> and
if that should come to pass, I shall be 
likewise bit by coming into them at this high
<font>Premium</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have indeed heard some idle Talk
of that kind; but I think it impracticable,
and find but very few People (if any)
under such Apprehensions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have seen it done with all the
Ease imaginable from 6 to 5, and from 5
to 4 <font>per Cent.</font> at once upon the whole
redeemable Debt; and that, at a Time,
when the Sinking Fund and the National
Credit were (as one may say) but in their
Infancy: Therefore how much more
probable is it to be now accomplished 
gradually, by the very Increase of Credit, and
<pagebreak id="22" />
Plenty of Money in the Funds, aided by
the large annual Surplus of the S--
F--?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said just now, that you had seen
that Reduction Scheme: Pray
communicate to me some of the Particulars?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It lies in a very narrow Compass: It
is therein supposed, that the <font>India</font>
Company will apply to Parliament (as you
was saying in the Beginning of our
Discourse) about the Tea Duties; and
supposes their Request to be granted, upon
Condition of submitting their Fund to be
reduced to 3 <font>per Cent.</font> That being done,
the <font>Bank</font> may be sent for, and a new
Lease granted them for a longer Term,
upon the same Conditions, and so on to
the other Funds, not doubting that when
any of the great Corporations have
complied, the remaining will accept
Neighbour's Fare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is all fine Talking; but it
cannot be done without a round Sum of
Money in Hand, ready to pay off such
obstinate Proprietors as will not be content
with such low Interest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Scheme hath provided for that
likewise, by proposing a Loan to be
opened at the <font>E--r</font> , at 3 <font>per Cent.</font> Interest,
upon the Credit of the S-- F-- for
two or three Years to come, payable in
<pagebreak id="23" />
Course, expecting that large Sums will soon
be brought in, rather than invest in Bonds,
&amp;c. at such extravagant <font>Premiums</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell what to say to it; it
may or may not succeed; but if it should,
it will make rare Work <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: maker are Work</comment> for           
<font>'Change-Alley</font> ;
from all Buyers, they will become all
Sellers, because the respective Dividends will
be lessened in Consequence thereof, <font>viz.</font>
<comment type="compiler">TABLE OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, do you suppose 1 1/4 <font>per Cent.</font>
Reduction of Dividend upon the <font>Bank</font>
Stock, and only 1 <font>per Cent.</font> upon all the
other Funds?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because the <font>Bank</font> have 1,600,000 <font>l.</font>
original Capital, now carrying 6 <font>per Cent.</font>
and 8,500,000 <font>l.</font> additional Capital,
attended with 4 <font>per Cent.</font> and consequently
3 <font>per Cent.</font> off the former, and 1 <font>per Cent.</font>
off the latter Sum, amount to 133,000 <font>l.</font>
a Year, which taken out of about 9,000,000 <font>l.</font>
Stock in the Hands of the Proprietors, is
more than 1 1/4 <font>per Cent.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the whole, all that I can
conclude from our Discourse is, that the Funds
are under a very odd <font>Dilemma</font> . If the
Peace should be settled, 3 <font>per Cent.</font> is like
to be their Portion; and if the Sword
<pagebreak id="24" />
should again be drawn, they will fall
considerably; and much more if we should
take Part in the Quarrel. Therefore I'll
not concern myself in any for the present;
but since so many Estates are advertized
for Sale, I'll look out for some agreeable
Purchase, and lay out my Money in Land.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>B.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I'll go and give my Friends the
Whisper (before the Town and the
Foreigners take the Alarm) that they may
not be left behind; and wishing you good
Success (for the present) I take my Leave
of you, hoping, when you have any
Commands in my Way, you will not forget
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may depend upon my
Friendship. -- Adieu.
