Serjeans, and my Corporals.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> What doth it please you sir? will you 
haue any thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I beleeue we must march, take our way,
and make a voyage to morrow: that it
behoues vs to beate to the fields one of these
dayes, or very soone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir where if it please you? in what part
must we goe? march? take our iourney? or 
make our voyage?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe not you know? against the enemy,
in the fields, in the champion field.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, what sort of enemy? what sort of
folkes be they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Spaniard, the Castilian, the Italian
and the Albanians.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The ill man breake his armes, the head
and the legges.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Amen, amen: so be it: so may it happen
vnto him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, is he so neere? is hee so nigh? is hee
verie neare?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes: see here he is at hand: behold,
he is here at our flankes: see here hee is
behind vs: see here he is within a shot of a
cannon, of a musket, of a harquebuse, of a pistol,
to vs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then shall it be for his harme, for his
damage, and to his losse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, since it is so, cause the horsemen to
aduance, the troops, the men at armes, the
carbins, the dragons, the light horsemen,
the fantassins, the lanciers, the
scoppetiers, the harquebusiers on horsebacke: and
all the other braue Voluntaries that follow
after vs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>O.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, see here they are all: see here they
come: and are all armed, equipaged and
ready. Behold also the barded horses that
conuoy the cannon, the baggage, and all the
munition, to wit, the powder, the bullets,
the cannon bullets, the match, the cariage,
the harnesse, the attirals, the victuallers, the
pinoniers, the mules, the mulers, the asses,
the nags; and all their equipage: and all
others munition and furniture of war.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Musketiers, be ready: Pikemen aduance
you to the front, quickly, quickly. Halt:
hold you still without any words: silence.
<pagebreak id="176" />
Giue the word to the Sergeant from hand

   Have courage my masters: take courage
fellowes: if it please God we shall all be rich:
we shall all be mounted, equipaged, and in
better order to morrow: wee shall well
recompence our long journeyes, and our great
trauell. For the Spaniards haue gold chaines
about their neckes, and great store of
pistols in their purses; without other fine white
money, so well rials, as mattes: and many
other sorts of money very fine and good.
    Sa, sa, prepare you: for they come and tell
vs, That the enemie is here at hand. Do not
ye heare his horses neigh? Light your
matches from hand to hand. Light your matches
at both the ends. Cocke your matches:
bullet in mouth.
   A brace of Sergeants from hand to hand.
Keepe your rankes: to your long order:
silence: no words, momme, halt, halt.
   Musketiers, are ye ready? giue fire, giue
fire. Ho, ho, let vs charge, charge, kill, kill.
Shoot, harquebusiers and musketiers. Haw
pikemen, aduance, aduance: charge, charge,
sa, sa, sa. Let vs giue on, let vs lay vpon those
robbers, for they shall pay very deare their
boldnesse: they shall pay deare their
rashnesse and comming.
   Cut, cut their throats: for euen so well
shall they cut yours, if they abide masters of
the battell, of the Champion field, of the
field, and of our Campe.

</dialogue> <head>LITTLE WORDS BETWEENE A SCHOOLE-MASTER,
AND ONE OF HIS SCHOLLERS.</head> 
   <nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Master, is the French tongue vneasie,
or difficult for to learne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no: in no wise: O no!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell mee the reason thereof: tell mee the
cause thereof: tell me the subject: tell mee
wherefore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Because (as it seemeth to me) that by the
meanes of the grace, the fauour, and the
assistance of God, there is nothing done, or
ordained by him, but it is easily learned: I say
concerning tongues.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Notwithstanding men say, That the
Bible, the holy Scriptures, the holy Writs, the
holy Letters are very mysticall, and vneasie
to be vnderstood?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well yea of the euill liuers, and of those
which neglect the duty which they owe to
our Lord: but concerning the faithfull,
<pagebreak id="177" />
they bee but tales, that they vnderstand
them not: yea euen so well as they wish,
prouided they vse good diligence, therein
praying the Lord to reveale to them the true
sense thereof.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But who forbids then that euery one
should reade it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Romish Church, the Church of
Rome: the Popish Church: the Church of
humane traditions: the Church of men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath it beene forbidden of God? of
Iesus Christ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No neuer: but (contrariwise) it hath
been instituted for mens saluation (fearing
God) generally to all sorts of men, yong, or
old, so well men as women: so well boyes
as wenches: so well fathers as mothers: so
well children as seruants, and seruing maids:
so well men of Church, as men of the fields
or trades men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why haue those men done that? tell me
the reason thereof?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ile tell it you? Couetousnesse is an euill
canker, which hath beene the cause of it,
and is yet cause of many other euils in the
world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then that hath also beene cause that the
Lord hath excluded his Word from such
folkes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea: and hath blinded them in their
wickednesse yet more: because they haue
shut the gate on him, when hee hath
knocked, desiring (by great mercy) their well
and saluation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But Master, why bring you mee here the
passages of the holy Scripture, and sacred
things, when I demand you other vocables
of little consequence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is for feare least all my Schollers should
neglect their owne duty towards their
Parents, and betters: to wit towards God first,
and his holy Word: and also to their Fathers
and mothers: Secondly, to their Superiours,
and folkes which they ought to reuerence:
thirdly, to keepe irrefragable amitie with 
their brothers and neighbours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I see then by that meanes, that
carelesnesse, and our lusts, are bad things: are euill
vices, obstacles, and lets, which hinder vs to
feare the Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes truely: truely yea: truely your
reason is good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, doe not you tell mee also that those
cursed vices, those cursed lusts: our wicked
flesh: the fragile, fraile, and soft worldly
things: all sorts of cupidities doe hinder
vs to know the Word of God: the
heroicall renowne of vertue the chast, and manly
<pagebreak id="178" />
force (which we ought to enjoy betwixt the
yong age, vntill the age of Adolescence and
virilitie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, I tell you the pure truth thereof: for
euery man that loseth the time after his lusts,
doth lose his courage: loseth his renowne:
loseth the force of his body: puts his bodie
in many dangers: strayeth himselfe from the
favours of God: tormenteth his conscience:
encurreth many excesses and scabs,
excrements, cathaires and euill humours.
Moreouer, dulleth his noble memory: putting
himselfe also in danger of the pockes, of
gangraynes, and vlcers which doe gnaw his
body: cuts him the thread of life before euer
he come to halfe age: where contrariwise,
he who feareth God (taking the time by the
end) and reading his Word: and betakes him
selfe to study, and to vertue (which bee the
true rudder of the faithfull, and generous)
shall sit among the learned, and graue men,
to giue counsell for the good and state of a
Common-wealth. Furthermore, the Lord
will fulfill him his Saying, dictated by the
holy Ghost, and by the mouth of his seruant,
and Prophet Dauid, Saying, &amp;c.
<comment type="compiler">VERSE OMITTED.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Maister, doe not the debauches, and
our lusts hinder the bringing vp of
the youth <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: yonth</comment> , our studies, and foraine tongues?
as the Latine, the French, the Italian, and
many other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely child, there is no doubt of it: for
what more honour can men get in the
world then to know to speake foraine
tongues? since that by S=t= Pauls own mouth
esteemes them worthy to be learned, calling
them the grace, and the gift of the Lord.
<pagebreak id="179" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Maister, is the French tongue very
needfull, and profitable among the Nobilitie?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea, and yet more profitable among the
Merchants: for except it be the Latine: me
thinkes, it is the most profitable of all
Christendome: and almost, it is so much in vse
(if I durst say it) as the Latine, and rather
more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it so easie, and docile to bee learned as
the Latine?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ma.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, much more: yea more then the
halfe.

little: drinke now and then (if God please)
and thou shalt liue long.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>N.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly Sir, hee who can doe his owne
affaires, will doe another mans worse.

when one desires not: to be at a gate when
they open not: and to haue a friend that

should be in a poore estate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what said he to thee?

on the Cister, Virginals, and on the Flute.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what folks hath he in his lodging?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I haue seene no body there, but a
deformed, hardfavoured, foule, heavy, deaf,
blind, dumme, squint-eyed, blind of one eie,
vncleane and hideous Baud.
<pagebreak id="234" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Verily! child, his house may then bee

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, and yet worse, hauing such a
wicked wife in his lodging.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath shee beene faire heretofore?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you may well thinke! for shee is
cloathed like a Nunne, coiffed like a
Puppet, lame of one Arme, crooked of one
Foot, blinde of one Eie, the other
bleare-ey'd, hulch-backt, crumpshouldered, bald,
flat-nosed; and that little shee hath is all

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas! I have great compassion on him:
but what said she to thee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, all toothlesse as shee was, began to
raile and scould on me, giving mee injuries,
and disdaining mee on the Market place in
the sight of everie one (I being ashamed to
flee away) shee approched verie nigh mee
and gave me a terrible blast of her stincking
Breath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be thou hast done some mischiefe
unto her, in dispraise of her beautie, or by
any bad or vndecent words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir excuse mee, for I had never seene
her before: and I beleeve there is not
such an intricate and vilde Drabbe in the
World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O what terrible things thou makest me
beleeve!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then shee is much vnlike one that I 
have seene to day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, how know you if she be fairer then
she that I have seene?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because shee hath none of those Parts
that thou esteemest her to haue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, which bee the fairest parts that a
Woman ought to haue for to bee reputed,
and to make her verily faire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>I.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They be three White, three Black, three
Red, three Long, three Short, three Big, three
Fine, three Narrow, three Broad, and three
Little.
