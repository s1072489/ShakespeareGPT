   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We desire in the first Place, Mr. <font>Edward  
Crispe</font> himself 
may be sworn, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (which was done accordingly.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr.          
<font>Crispe</font> , give an 
account to my Lord and the Jury of the whole Matter. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On <font>New-Years-Day</font> last I was invited to sup  
at Mr. <font>Coke's</font> , and 
being there, he proposed to me to go to Mrs. <font>Fanny Monke's</font> . 
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this before or after Supper?
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was before Supper: We supp'd about seven,   
and after 
Supper about ten a-clock he call'd me out of his Parlour, I follow'd 
him; we went into the Church-yard. It was then very dark, the 
Moon did not shine. He took three or four Turns before the House 
where Mrs. <font>Monke</font> dwelt, then he stood still and made a noise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What kind of Noise did he make?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was like a Hollowing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you under any Fear or Apprehension from   
that 
Noise?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, I was afraid, and made up towards 
the Wall; 
but in a quarter of a Minute somebody came behind me, and knock'd 
me down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you then know who that Man was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you tell what was done to you afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I cannot, for on that Blow I lost my   
Senses for 
some time.
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it before your Senses returned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I cannot tell, but in some time I got  
up, and 
return'd to Mr. <font>Coke's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what Condition did you find your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was ready to die and faint, and I was found   
very much 
wounded.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did any Chyrurgeon come to you at Mr.     
<font>Coke's</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, Mr. <font>Sturgeon</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the Person came up who knock'd you down, 
did you 
hear Mr. <font>Coke</font> say any thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you tell whether he stay'd any time, or    
what became 
of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I cannot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he there when the first Blow was given?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will the Prisoners ask Mr. <font>Crispe</font> any      
Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , was I present when you were      
knock'd down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember that you saw me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near was I to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were close by me when I was knock'd down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mr. <font>Brown</font> and swear him,           
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (which was accordingly 
done.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you are a Relation of Mr. <font>Coke's</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, I married his own Sister, and he       
married Mr. 
<font>Crispe's</font> Sister.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you at Mr. <font>Coke's</font> house last        
<font>New-Years-Day</font> 
at night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Day or two before last <font>New-Years-Day</font> , I    
and my Wife 
and Daughter were invited to sup with him, and accordingly we 
went. I came about six a-clock, and found Mr. <font>Coke</font> and Mr.        
<font>Crispe</font> 
drinking a Glass of Wine in the Parlour before Supper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any other Company with them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, the Women were above Stairs. I sat down with 
them, 
and we three staid in the Parlour till Supper-time. When Supper 
was ready, we went up Stairs. Then after Supper between eight 
and nine, we three came down into the Parlour again. Some time 
after, <font>Coke</font> went out of the Room, and then came back again and 
gave a Call, or beckon'd to Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , who follow'd him out of 
the Room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what time of night was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After nine a-clock at night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it before Mr. <font>Coke</font>       
return'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was gone about ten Minutes, and then returned.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he in any disorder when he returned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He seem'd to be out of breath, as if he had been 
walking 
faster than ordinary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far distant is the Church-Yard, where 
this 
Gentlewoman dwelt, from Mr. <font>Coke's</font> House?
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Church-Yard is about twice the length of this 
Shire-House from Mr. <font>Coke's</font> House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did <font>Coke</font> do when he came in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Immediately he drunk a Glass of Wine to me, and  
after 
he had sat some time, he went out of the Room. I heard a 
Noise up Stairs, and being told my Daughter was ill, I went up, and 
in a little time came down again into the Parlour, where I found 
Mr. <font>Coke</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ask him what was become of Mr.    
<font>Crispe</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did then ask him what was become of Mr.        
<font>Crispe</font> , and he 
told me that he believ'd he was gone home in the dark. In about 
two or three Minutes after, Mr. <font>Crispe</font> came in. He was very much 
wounded and bloody. I was so surprized that I could not take 
particular notice of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it from <font>Crispe's</font> going out to 
his coming in 
again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was near half an hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So then <font>Coke</font> returned in about ten         
Minutes, and <font>Crispe</font> in 
near half an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr <font>Coke</font> see Mr. <font>Crispe</font> when he  
came back to his 
House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He seem'd to be in a great Consternation. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know of any Estate that would have come 
to Mr. 
<font>Coke</font> after Mr. <font>Crispe's</font> Death?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot positively say it of my own Knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will ask Mr. <font>Crispe</font> that Question.       
Pray, Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , 
would any Estate have come by your Death to Mr. <font>Coke</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In case I had died, One hundred Pounds          
<font> <foreign>per annum</foreign> </font> would 
have come to his Wife as one of my Sisters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you then no Children, nor Brothers?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crispe.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord; my next of Kin are three Sisters,  
one of 
which is Mr. <font>Coke's</font> Wife, she would have been one of my Heirs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mr. <font>Sturgeon</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (who          
appeared, and was sworn,) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What 
do you know concerning this wounding of Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sturg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a Chirurgeon by Profession; and the first   
day of <font>January</font> 
last at Night, about Eleven a-clock, I was sent for to Mr.           
<font>Crispe</font> at 
Mr. <font>Coke's</font> House: When I came, I found him very much wounded and 
cut, and in a very weak Condition, and that he had lost a great deal 
of 
Blood. I examined his Wounds: One Wound began at his right Ear, 
divided the fleshy part of his Cheek, and ended on his upper Lip just 
under his right Nostril; the Flesh was all divided, and the Jaw left 
naked. Another Wound divided the right side of the Nostril, and 
made an oblique Cross over the Wound, and ended near the right 
under Jaw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was his Nose slit?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sturg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, the Nose was cut from without into the 
Nostril; 
the Edge of the Nose was not cut through, but there was a Cut or 
Slit in the Nose that went through: I sow'd it up: it was indeed 
<pagebreak id="12" />
but with one Stitch; it is yet visible, and the Nose was cut 
through.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were there any other Wounds?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sturg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was another deep Wound under his Chin,      
that reach'd 
from one Jaw to the other. There was another Wound, which 
began at his Chin, cross'd the left under Jaw, and tended towards his 
Ear. There was also a small Wound on his left Cheek, another on 
his upper Lip, and another on his left Temple.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How many Wounds had he in all?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sturg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Seven.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think there were seven distinct      
Wounds, that 
had seven distinct Blows?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sturg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I take it, that every one of the seven Wounds     
had a distinct 
Blow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With what Instrument did you apprehend       
those Blows 
were given?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sturg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was cut so clean, that I thought it was done  
either by 
a Knife or Razor.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let the Jury see Mr. <font>Crispe's</font> Wounds.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Then his Face and Wounds were shewn to the Jury for their 
Observation.) </font> </nonSpeech> 

   <nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Swear <font>Charles Willett</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (which   
was done 
accordingly.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you are a Constable in <font>Bury St.        
Edmonds</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Willett.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had you any occasion to speak to          
<font>Woodburne</font> 
concerning this Matter, and what did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had a Warrant from Alderman <font>Wright</font> and Mr.  
Serjeant 
<font>Reynolds</font> to apprehend <font>Coke</font> upon <font>Woodburne's</font> Examination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Question ask'd you is, What you know  
of 
<font>Woodburne's</font> Confession, and what he hath said to you about this 
Matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After <font>Woodburne</font> was committed, I was with      
him, and ask'd 
him, Whether he was concerned in the wounding of Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ? He 
told me, Yes he was. I ask'd him, Whether Mr. <font>Coke</font> was with him: 
he said he was. I ask'd him how long <font>Coke</font> stay'd with him: He 
said, That he had struck <font>Crispe</font> three or four Blows before       
<font>Coke</font> left 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What else did you ask him, or did he say to 
you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me, that he was walking up and down in the 
Churchyard when <font>Coke</font> whistled to him, and that on that Signal he 
went up 
and assaulted Mr. <font>Crispe</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he give you any account how long and  
where 
he waited before the Fact was done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me, that he was desired by Mr. <font>Coke</font>    
to be up and 
down in the Churchyard about Nine a-clock that Night; and that 
being a cold Night, <font>Coke</font> gave him a Bottle of Brandy, and told him 
he could not tell what time <font>Crispe</font> would come home, but desired  
him 
to be ready and to stay let it be never so long.
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Branthw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you with what Instrument he   
did it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me, He did it with an Hook or Bill, that  
was new 
ground for the Purpose, and that it was in his House at the right 
hand of his Door. I went according to his Direction, and found it, 
and brought it to him; and he said, That that was the Hook. --
The Hook I have brought with me, and this is the Hook that I have 
now in my Hand.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>William Wetherel</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (who was     
sworn.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give 
my Lord and the Jury an account what you know of this 
Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am the Gaoler; and the Day after Mr. <font>Coke</font>   
was committed 
to me, about five Minutes after One, he sent for me up into his 
Chamber, where his Wife was crying and in great disorder, as he 
seem'd to be likewise. She was desiring her Husband to discover. 
When he came to himself, he told me, That he and <font>Woodburne</font> had 
had a Design to murder Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , and had attempted it several 
times; 
and desired me to go and secure <font>Woodburne</font> . I went to the        
Alderman,
and told him of it, and he gave me the like Orders. Coming from the 
Alderman I met Mr. <font>Coke's</font> Man, who ask'd me whether I had found 
him; on which I ask'd him, Who, and what he meant, thinking him 
to be ignorant of his Master's Confession: but he told me, that his 
Master had discovered it to him, and had sent him to take up 
<font>Woodburne</font> . Whilst we were talking, we saw <font>Woodburne</font> coming  
up, and 
we desir'd one <font>John Carter</font> a Smith, who was shooing a Horse, to 
assist us; which he did, and we secur'd <font>Woodburne</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Coke</font> confess any thing to you      
concerning this Fact, 
and the manner of doing it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, he did. He told me several times,   
that he 
had a design to murder <font>Crispe</font> , and that he employ'd             
<font>Woodburne</font> , and 
delivered <font>Crispe</font> into his hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he tell you that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did tell me so: He told me also, That it was   
done with 
an Hook; and that he had bid <font>Woodburne</font> to cut his Weasand or 
Windpipe; and that if <font>Woodburne</font> had not been a cow-hearted Dog, he 
would have so done, and secur'd <font>Crispe</font> from telling Tales. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Coke</font> tell you what Means he used to do 
this to 
Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, That he call'd him out of his House,     
went into the 
Church-yard with him, and there delivered him into <font>Woodburne's</font> 
hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say what Signal was given?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not that I remember; but he said, That            
<font>Woodburne</font> was 
placed there by his Appointment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what Design?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With an intent to murder him. When <font>Woodburne</font>  
struck him, 
<font>Coke</font> said, he went away immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What have you heard <font>Woodburne</font> say          
concerning this 
Fact?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard <font>Woodburne</font> say, That he and       
<font>Coke</font> had lain in 
wait several times and at several places to murder Mr. <font>Crispe</font> .
<pagebreak id="14" /> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Woodburne</font> give you any account what he 
did at this 
time to Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he did; he said, That he struck him a Blow   
with his 
Hook, and that not quite striking him down, he gave him a second 
Blow which did; and that <font>Crispe</font> , as he was falling, (who was    
never 
us'd to swear) cried out, God damn him; and that then it went to 
his very Heart to think that he should kill a Man with an Oath in 
his Mouth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say he gave him many Blows?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, He gave him several Blows, and that he   
thought he 
was dead.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>Robert Moon</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (who appeared, and 
was sworn.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What 
do you know of this Matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Moon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I heard what happen'd to <font>Crispe</font> , I       
said, I knew the 
Person who did it, or the Person who employ'd him to do it; and 
the reason was, because three Years, or three Years and a half ago, 
Mr. <font>Coke</font> sent for me, and said to me, at first I thought it to    
be in a 
jesting way, that he wish'd Mr. <font>Crispe</font> out of the World, he was a 
good-for-nothing Fellow, his Wife had a trick of playing away his 
Estate, and he wish'd some body would knock him in the Head. 
Sir, said I to him, what advantage would that be to you? He shook 
his Head, and said, A very good Estate. Said I, I thought <font>Crispe</font> 
had but a small Estate. Yes, said he, a very good one. Then I 
began to think there was something in it. After some little time, said 
he, I do not value ten or twenty Guineas to knock him in the head. 
Then I began a little to reflect that he should have such an opinion 
of me, that I should be such a sort of Person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then did you say to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Moon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told him, That I would not kill the greatest    
Villain in

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he say afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Moon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember, I have forgot if there was any 
thing 
else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Lee.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you to remember this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Moon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I heard of this Fact committed on Mr.        
<font>Crispe</font> , then it 
came fresh into my Memory.    

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>John Carter</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (who appeared, 
and was sworn.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What 
Trade are you of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Blacksmith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did <font>Coke</font> at any time send <font>Woodburne</font> 
for you, and what 
past thereon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On the Friday before <font>New-Years-Day</font> last,    
which was on a 
Monday, Mr. <font>Coke</font> sent <font>Woodburne</font> to me, who told me his        
Master <font>Coke</font> 
wanted to speak with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you go?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I went to his House, and he order'd me to  
come up 
to him in his Chamber. When I came up, he told me that he wanted 
a good strong Horse to carry his Weight. I told him I did not know of 
<pagebreak id="15" />
any one then; but when I did, I would let him know. Upon that 
he said, By God, how do you go on, Boy? I hear you have lost most 
of your Business, you have got no Iron nor Coals, and you are afraid 
of a Goal; I have a thing now in agitation that will make a Man of 
you as long as you live. I said I should be very glad of that. Said 
he, Can you keep a Secret? Yes, said I, as well as any one to serve my 
self and my Friend. Said he, Can you keep one of the biggest Secrets 
in the World? I told him, As well as any body. Said he, You are 
pretty much in Debt, and if you will serve me in this, I can make 
a Man of you as long as you live: do you think you could cut five or 
six Mens Heads off without Scruple of Conscience? I told him, No; 
it was too much for a Man's Conscience to bear. Said he, What, a 
Scruple of Conscience to do such a thing as that? There are those 
above who have done ten times worse. I suppose, Sir, said I, you 
mean the <font>South-Sea</font> Gentlemen. Yes, said he, so I do; they have 
ruined Families, and begger'd Gentlemen: To cut Mens Heads off is 
but a Trifle to them. Said I, Mr. <font>Coke</font> , I believe you speak     
only in joke, 
by way of merriment. Said he, What, do you think I sent for you 
by way of joke? I told him, I could not do any such thing. Then, 
said he, do you think you can cut off one Man's Head without Scruple 
of Conscience? I told him, No. Then, said he, If you can't cut off a 
Man's Head, and lay it down upon the Table before me, you are 
not for my turn: On that he fetch'd a Bottel of Brandy, and gave 
me a Glass or two, and then said to me, <font>Carter</font> , I would have    
you go 
home, and consider of it for two or three Days, and if you can cut 
off a Man's Head without Scruple of Conscience, you shall have 
plenty of Gold and Silver, and any thing else you ask. I told him, 
I needed no Consideration, for I could not do it. Then, said he, send 
<font>Woodburne</font> to me. And as I went out, I saw <font>Woodburne</font> at the   
Door, 
and sent him in to Mr. <font>Coke</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say any thing else to you, or any    
thing about 
Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Carter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I live in a House of Mr. <font>Crispe's</font> , and Mr.  
<font>Coke</font> had been 
formerly his Steward, and <font>Woodburne</font> acted under him. And Mr.     
<font>Coke</font> 
said, that he heard my House was out of repair, that it would be his 
after Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , and whether I should not like it better for   
him to 
keep it in repair, as he had done before.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Serj. <font>Selby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think, my Lord, we have done with our     
Evidence,
and have sufficiently proved Mr. <font>Coke</font> and <font>Woodburne</font> to be    
guilty not
only within the Intention but the Letter of the Statute of the 22d of
<font>Car.</font> II. upon which they stand indicted. We have proved the Malice
premeditated and forethought, the Intention to maim and disfigure
by slitting the Nose (for Mens Intentions must be construed by their
Actions) and the maiming and disfiguring accordingly; and that Mr.
<font>Coke</font> was privy to, and the Aider and Abettor of the Offence: And
therefore, Gentlemen of the Jury, we can't doubt but that you will
find them both Guilty; and that your Verdict and their Conviction
will be with the Suffrage of all Mankind.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Woodburne</font> , What have you to say for your

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please your Honour, my Lord, the      
first time 
that <font>Coke</font> began with me about this Matter was on a Wednesday in  
last 
Barley-Harvest. He sent for me to mend his Copper, and after I had

done it, he bid me go to the further end of the <font>Mill-Lane</font> , and  
there 
he must speak with me, and which came first should stay for the 
other. I was there before him; when he came, he was on 
horseback, and his Horse kicked about in a furious manner, that the   
People 
took notice of it. When they were gone, he told me that he had a 
thing for me to do, but not to be done presently, and that if I did  
it 
I should want for nothing. I ask'd him what it was. He said, about 
Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , to set him aside, that is, to kill him; but he      
said, it was 
not to be done presently: so he put his Hand in his Pocket and gave 
me Eighteen Pence. I told him, I never did such a thing in my Life; 
I could not do it. Said he, It is not to be done presently, we have 
time to consider. A while after he sent for me again, and ask'd 
me, Whether I had considered of it. I told him, I could not do 
it. Said he, We must set <font>Crispe</font> aside; for Mrs. <font>Crispe</font> hath  
got a 
trick to play; she will make away what there is from me and my 
Child. I said, I never did any such thing; I could not do it, and 
desired him to forbear. I went away and left him in his Chamber. 
Within a while after he came to my House; said he, <font>John</font> , what is 
the reason you can't do this for me? Said I, I cannot do it. Said 
he, What signifies it, I would do it for you. I said, I could not 
do it. The he went away very uneasy, and in a Week or 
Fortnight sent for me again to his Chamber, and there was at me      
again. 
I told him, I could do no such Work. Said he, Why can't you 
do this Work? I have been a good Master for you, I made my self 
look little to bail you when you were in Gaol. I turned about 
and cried. Said he, What makes you cry? Your Crying signifies 
nothing; the Money that I shall give you, will do you and your 
Family a kindness. Said I, I can do no such thing. Said he, It 
signifies no more the killing of him, than to kill a Dog, for they 
do no good with what they have. Yes, said I, Mr. <font>Crispe</font> is a very 
good Master; I work'd for him and his Father before him: and 
so I went away. Afterwards my Wife died three days before 
<font>Gunpowder-Treason</font> last: she was buried on that day, and being    
very poor, 
I sent my Daughter to desire a little Money of him to have the 
Bell toll'd for my Wife; but he sent me none. My Wife was 
buried on a <font>Sunday</font> , then on the <font>Monday</font> he sent his Boy for  
me; 
I went down to him, and when I came, I fell a weeping for the 
loss of my Wife, and having ten Children. Said he, What makes 
you cry? you must pull up a good Heart; tho your Wife be dead, 
you may have Friends; here is that which will do you a kindness 
hereafter. Said I, I am very sorry for the loss of my Wife. Said he, 
What signifies that? she was carried well into the Church, and is, 
no doubt, happy; she is gone before you; we must all go in our 
time: I was a Friend to you in her Illness; I sent her a good 
Doctor at my own Charge: this twenty Pounds that I will give 
you will be a brave Estate for you.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was to kill Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ; he told me,  
that I must set 
aside Mr. <font>Crispe</font> ; he offer'd me Twenty Pounds to do it; but I   
then refus'd it. 
On <font>Monday</font> , New-Years-Day, in the Morning, <font>Coke</font> sent his Boy 
for me 
to come to him; and between Eight and Nine, in the Morning, I went to 
him. He was in his green Room. Now, said he, <font>John</font> , we shall have 
the fairest Opportunity to kill Mr. <font>Crispe</font> . I told him, I was   
loth to do it; 
it was very cold, and I had an Ague. Said he, I will give you that,  
which 
shall warm you; he went to his Closet, and gave me out of the Bottle,
that he used to carry in his Pocket, half a Pint of Brandy, and told 
me, 
that happen how it will, I must not come near his House any more that 
Day, lest afterwards there should be some Suspicion; but said he, 
Whether Ague or not, you must be at Mr. <font>Morrice's</font> Porch, which   
is in the 
Church-yard, about Eight a-clock in the Evening. I went there between 
Eight and Nine; about Nine, <font>Coke</font> came out, and gave me a Whistle; 
on that I went up to him; he told me, Mr. <font>Crispe</font> was very jolly, 
and 
he believ'd, it would be late before he came out. I told him, I did 
not care to stay. Said he, You must stay now; this is the Time that 
will do it. I staid 'till Ten-a-clock; then he came to me again in Mr. 
<font>Morrice's</font> Porch, and told me, That he believed <font>Crispe</font> would  
not go 'till 
Eleven-a-clock; but the later the better. Then he went from me again, 
and a little after Ten, <font>Coke</font> and <font>Crispe</font> came out together,   
and on <font>Coke's</font> 
whistling I came up to them; <font>Crispe</font> was then before, and coming to 
get against the Wall. I came up to <font>Coke</font> ; he bid me have a care  
not 
to hit him instead of <font>Crispe</font> , being very dark; so he took me by 
the 
Sleeve to lead me up to <font>Crispe</font> , and said to <font>Crispe</font> ,        
Brother, stand still; on 
that I hit him two Stroaks with my Hook; tho' I never heard him swear 
before, yet he now swore, God damn him; on that, <font>Coke</font> said, What! 
Doth he swear? Secure him, down with him; he stood by him 'till I 
gave him several Blows, and then he went away. <font>Coke</font> desired me   
to take 
away his Watch; for, saith he, As to his Money, he don't carry above 
Half a Crown or Three Shillings in his Pocket; and when I go to 
<font>London</font> , I will sell the Watch for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What <font>Woodburne</font> saith against <font>Coke</font> is 
no Evidence against 
<font>Coke</font> , and should not have been mention'd by him; but what he    
saith 
relating to himself before the Fact, is so twisted with <font>Coke</font> ,   
that without 
the Whole it is not so intelligible as to himself. However, the Jury 
are to 
take notice, that what <font>Woodburne</font> saith, is only Evidence against 
himself, 
and not against <font>Coke</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After you had given him those several Blows  
with your 
Hook, what did you next?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I began immediately to reflect on what I had 
done, and 
went away forthwith to my own House, where I was about to take a 
Line to hang myself.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ann Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On the <font>Wednesday</font> before              
New-Years-Day, <font>Coke</font> sent 
for my Father by his Boy; I told the Boy, my Father was in Bed, and 
sick of an Ague and could not come. The Boy came again, and said, 
my Father must by all means come; but he would not then go, but he 
went to him on New-Years-Day in the Morning, and came home again. 
About Five or Six-a-clock in the Evening, my Father went out with a 
Hook in his Hand; and he said, he should not be at Home 'till Eleven 
or Twelve at Night; and if any body came for him, he bid us not take 
any notice but that he was at Home. We thought he took the Hook to 
cut some Wood with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any thing more to say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ann Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When my Mother died, I went to Mr.       
<font>Coke's</font> to 
borrow Five Shillings of him, to have the great Bell toll for my     
Mother; and 
told him, that my Father would pay him again. He said, What          
signifi'd the 
ringing out of the great Bell; her Soul would be never the better    
for it; 
but, if he'll satisfy me in my Request, he shall have Five times Five 
Shillings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you, <font>Sarah Woodburne</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sarah Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Coke</font> did frequently send for my    
Father, at all times 
both of Day and Night; and he would often come to my Father, and 
when he came, they would go out, and walk down the Backside, and 
talk together. After this Fact was done, <font>Coke</font> sent his Boy for my 
Father, and the Boy said, They must not go together, for if they did, 
People would take notice of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Woodburne</font> , have you any thing more to   
say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Woodburne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Day Nine Weeks, which was a Week after  
the Fact 
committed, <font>Coke</font> sent for me, and said, <font>John</font> , I wish you      
would have 
done the thing I order'd you; but you have been before Alderman 
<font>Wright</font> and the Recorder, and have told your Story well; but hold 
you 
fast, they will examine you again; I shall --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is subsequent to the Fact, and is not   
Evidence against 
<font>Coke</font> . If you <font>Woodburne</font> have done; then Mr. <font>Coke</font> , what  
have you to 
say for your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please your Lordship, I am much asham'd,   
and very 
unable to defend my self; I am asham'd to think I should be          
concern'd in
so heinous a Crime against Mr. <font>Crispe's</font> Life; I am even          
confounded at 
it; it is indeed a very great Crime, and I know not what to say for 
my self. As for <font>Woodburne</font> , he hath asserted against me several  
things 
that are false.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have told the Jury, that what he hath said 
is no 
Evidence against you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I first spoke of this Matter to              
<font>Woodburne</font> , he said, he 
should value it no more than the cutting off the Head of a Dog. I 
did, indeed, go out with Mr. <font>Crispe</font> that Night, but I was not    
near him 
when <font>Woodburne</font> struck him, but retreated to my own House in a 
Moment. My Lord, I am very sensible that a Point of Law may arise on 
the Statute whereon I am indicted
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With respect to my Intention.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Intention is Matter of Fact, and must    
be try'd by 
the Jury, whether your Intent was to maim and disfigure; this doth not 
seem to me to be a Point of Law; if there be any Point of Law that 
shall arise, you shall have Counsel to speak to it; but whether you  
slit 
Mr. <font>Crispe's</font> Nose, with an Intention to disfigure him, is a      
Matter of Fact.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Intent was to kill Mr. <font>Crispe</font> , and not to 
maim or disfigure 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But that is the Question the Jury are to      
try, Whether you
did not of Malice slit his Nose, with an Intent to disfigure him. If 
the
Jury do not find that you so did, you must be acquitted on this
Indictment. Supposing your Design was to kill, yet your Design might  
be
likewise to maim; and this the Jury must try; this is Matter of Fact 
for
their Consideration.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a very penal Statute, and I am unable to  
plead my own
Cause; I beg your Lordship to assign me Counsel.
