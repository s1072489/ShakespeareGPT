saw a great many Soldiers throwing Stones
at the Windows of Mr. <font>Hurst</font> the
Ironmonger, being encouraged by an Officer of
the Regiment, whose Name this Informant
knoweth not; and after some time, a
Gentleman, whom this Informant believes was the
Major, said to them,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Come in, Boys, and drink,
and then go out and at it again</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and
accordingly they did go in with him, and when they

   <nonSpeech>This Informant saith, That he was last
Night standing by the Bonfire against
the <font>Star-Inn</font> in this City, and there saw a
great many Soldiers breaking Mr. <font>Hurst's</font>
Windows, and while they were about it, one
of the Lieutenants, whose Name this
Informant believes is <font>Hamilton</font> , came out and
lighted his Pipe at the Bonfire, and all the
while looking upon them; and when he had
lighted his Pipe, he walked over into the
Lane next Mr. <font>Hurst's</font> , and the Soldiers
followed him; but what he said to them this
Informant knows not; but said, That the
Soldiers went immediately to gathering up of
Stones, and then went up the Street, and
down the High-Street, all the way breaking
of Windows; And when they came near
<pagebreak id="5" />
Sir <font>Daniel Webb's</font> House, Sir <font>Daniel</font> overtook
them, and ask'd them what they meant by
making such a Disturbance? Whereupon
they immediately fell a swearing and cursing,
and several of them stuck him with their
Sticks; and one <font>Fosty Magee</font> , a Corporal in
the Colonel's Company (as this Informant is
since told he is) drew his Sword, and held it
against Sir <font>Daniel</font> : Whereupon this
Informant told him Sir <font>Daniel</font> was a Justice of
the Peace, and one of the Magistrates of the
City: Upon which the said <font>Magee</font> curs'd Sir
<font>Daniel</font> , and said, <font>He did not care what he was</font> ;
further said, <font>He was a Rogue and a Rascal</font> .
After which, they went over to Mr. Mayor's, and
broke his Windows; and when Mr. Mayor
came out to demand the Reason, several of
them, and particularly the said <font>Magee</font> , came
up to Mr. Mayor with their drawn Swords;
and further saith, That Mr. Mayor went
with his Mace, and accompany'd Sir <font>Daniel
Webb</font> to the Major at the <font>Star-Inn</font> , to
complain of the Disorders by the Soldiers, and
to desire his Assistance; and as they came
away from him this Informant heard the
Major say,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Go to the Devil like a Parcel of</font>
Jacobites, <font>or I will make you go</font> .

time, this Informant's Sister said, <font>She heard
the Glass-Windows rattle</font> , which this
Informant could not at first believe; but soon after
this Informant heard it himself, and then
went out to see who it was that broke the
Windows; and when he came out, he saw
the Major of the Regiment take up a Stone,
and brake the Windows with it; upon
which this Informant said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, <font>I will take a
Note of your Name</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>whereupon the Major
drew his Sword, and ran after this
Informant, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Damn you, will you take
Notice of Names</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>But this Informant ran
into his Father's House, and lock'd the Door
before the Major could overtake him; but
they still continu'd to break the Windows,
which, after some time, provok'd this
Informant to go out again, and then he saw the
Major throw a Fire-Stick from the Bonfire
at his Father's Windows; and did at the
<pagebreak id="7" />
same time likewise see the Tapster at the
<font>Star-Inn</font> , and one <font>Edward West</font> , the

Swearing, that he would send Soldiers at
Night to break the Windows of the
Colleges; and repeated the same very often, and
was in a very great Passion.</nonSpeech>
