DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN
<font>RALPH MIXINGTON</font> , A CITY VINTNER,
AND 
<font>JENNY</font> HIS WIFE.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Fine Trade this! Mr. <font>Mixington</font> when our own  
Trade declines so visibly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! Was it for this you Leer'd upon me so, and     
wink'd me up into
the Bed-Chamber? I thought I should have been quit of you for 2 or 3
dissembling Kisses, and parting with my Ready Cash, now I'm going    
out of Town
this <font>Saturday</font> in the Afternoon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your ready Cash! I know of none you have; you're a 
Beggar in all Senses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Madam, no matter whether I'm rich or poor, but  
I can tell your
wealthy Ladyship, that all <font>Lombard-street</font> can't fill a Money Bag 
without a Bottom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh my Heart </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Cries) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Soh! To the Misery 
of approaching Poverty we
must have, aiming at Wit, come in for an additional Plague.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let it approach as it will; a Jolly Conceit, a Merry 
Glass, and a Ratling
Noddle are proof against it, but a Wife clenches it to us; and such  
a Wife too
as is a certain help-mate to Vexation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet without this Help-mate thou had'st been as 
wretched a
Stair-Ambler as ever carried a Role after an Oyster-woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And without this, Stair-Trotter, thou hadst been     
still in an Eighteen-penny
Lodging in the noble <font>White-Fryers</font> , or a worse Place; and        
Butter'd Wheat and
Cheese would never have plump'd up your Countenance to be the wonder
of the Ward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not by my Credit with the Merchants that I  
set thee up?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Madam, your Credit has been as remarkable as my  
Reputation;
never was Man so set up: What between the <font>Jews</font> Synagogue, the    
<font>French</font>
<pagebreak id="2" />
<font>Hugonot</font> , Phanatick-Meetings, and the Ambassadors                
Popish-Chappel, I've had
more Religious and National Clubs to the Rigging me out, than there  
go to
the compleating a Confederate-Army.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ungrateful Wretch as thou art! Is this Requiting   
thy poor Wife, and
the Worthy Gentlemen that put thee into Business?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay Child, and they put Business into thee, found     
thee Employment, and
me Leisure, and now at last will do my Business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you blame Careful Men for looking out, when    
they meet an Owl
with a Wig like a new-Curl'd Distaff, with his Red top'd Tripe       
Jocky-Buskins, girdled about the Loins like a Monkey, Gallopping to  
<font>Epsom</font> , and find
his House as Empty as an <font>Islington</font> Musick-House in the midst of  
Winter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And perhaps the poor Pains-taking Woman in her       
Helmet of a
Vizard-Mask, and her Fighting-Suit without Stayes, is Galloping as   
fast in a
Hackney-Coach with an Impudent, Chattering, Wall-Ey'd Forreigner to  
the other
End of the Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Infamous Scandal! Your Servants, nay your self     
know I constantly
keep home when you are out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, by the same Token I found you once in your      
Chamber, when I
came Home unexpectedly, with a Touz'd Head, a Breast open (for Air I
suppose) a blowzing Colour, two Bottles and Dr. <font>Pulse</font> , and then 
'twas whisper'd,
<font>Lord, my Dear, you come most opportunely to give the Doctor a Fee  
for Relieving
me from the Terriblest Fit I ever felt</font> , (and thou hast <font>felt</font>   
many, that I'll say) so
the Doctor, though I gave him a good Fee, look'd like a Fool, thou   
like a
Beast, and I like a Monster.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou deserv'st it for censuring me so barbarously  
that was at Death's Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. no, thy Chief Confident, Sandy-hair'd <font>Sue</font>    
shou'd have been at the
Door. How could the Doctor, (whom the Devil Pill) relieve thee, when
<font>Sam. Bum-poke</font> the Apothecary had not been in the House with any  
Medicine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With his own Drops out of his Pocket.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And two Bottles of <font>Burgundy</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Wretch, of the same that I Dog'd two Hampers   
full to the
black-Ey'd Damsel's Lodgings in <font>Covent-garden</font> , that went for    
the Wife of a
Custom-House Officer, who was decipher'd to me with your very        
Cloaths, Sneer, and Nose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not quite so exactly as your tall Ladyship and       
Orange-colour'd <font>Sue</font> were
describ'd coming out of Chambers in the <font>Temple</font> on a <font>Monday</font>   
Morning, when
Lord knows ever since <font>Saturday</font> Afternoon you were at Alderman    
<font>Rounceful's</font>
Country-House with his Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Informer was a Villain and a Lyar; but what   
can I expect from
one that must have his Whisk-playing Meetings, his Joaking Clubs,    
and Tribe
of Wits about him, Trip-writers, Ballad-Scribes, and City Poets.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A better Assembly than your dear Mrs. <font>Gulpington</font> 
the Midwife, Madam
<font>Franshimange</font> the <font>French</font> Mantua-maker, the <font>Indian</font> Woman,  
Mrs. <font>Decoy</font> , and
Col. <font>Quester's</font> Tricking Widdow, that is both Jacobite and        
<font>Dutch-woman</font> ,
Merchandizer, Wit and Bawd, <font>Jew</font> and <font>Gentile</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Foul Mouth, you measure others by your Heathenish  
self, and Paganly
Companions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee when thou Attack'st my Christianity, don't   
clap in the <font>Jew</font> too,
thou hast too much Skill in Circumcision.
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brute -- you had been low enough but for some of   
them; is not Wealth
your Aim?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay <font>Jenny</font> , and if Pleasure is thine, prithee     
take a better Mark; by <font>Bacchus</font> ,
it's the Devil indeed to have an Envoy Extraordinary from him in a
Composition of cheating an <font>Amsterdammer</font> , a Pagode <font>Mulatto     
Portuguese</font> : Why I'd
as live be Rivall'd by the <font>Man-Teger</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font> (Laughs) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, well, you express your  
self Whimsically, I'll pass by
your Scurrilous Malice, and give you your Saying and your Way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay <font>Jenny</font> , and my Reward too when time serves    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (aside) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> either the Jade has
hit my blind-side, or I have really conquer'd her by my Wit. Gad, I  
think too,
thou Ape, that thou hast Wit, tho' thou wert plaguy silent before I  
had thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You took me for my <font>Beauty</font> , and swore I        
excelled all the Colours that
ever glorious Wine reflected on Mortals, and my Kisses more          
delicious than any
Nectar the Sun ever began, or Artist finish'd from the Grape, and if 
you find
some Wit and Sense besides, it's more than expected, and above the   
bargain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay <font>Jenny</font> , 'tis more, as the <font>Witch</font> covenants 
with the <font>Devil</font> for Wealth,
and has Damnation into the bargain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well express'd, but come <font>Rafee`</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (stroaks 
him) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> no more Satyr.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well <font>Jenny</font> , no more Swaggering nor Uneasiness,  
and to satisfie thee, things
are better than thou think'st; for the 2 Country Vintners, and the   
Widow of the
Inn that I fear'd would have sunk me float aloft bravely, are able   
to pay me,
and let me get twice as much by 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee how?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why <font>Bob Cyder-Twist</font> has an Uncle, Teacher to a   
private Congregation,
that's dead, and left him 3000 <font>l.</font> I wish he don't leave off our  
Trade and
succeed him in his.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never fear it, he's too much a Rake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lard! fie! When a Man is Wealthy, he is always     
Reform'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And <font>Nick Shatter</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Elder <font>Brother's</font> dead, and has left him 300   
<font>l. per An.</font> He's to marry,
and has already converted his Cousin the Crooked One-ey'd Quaker,    
and I have
a Letter for thee to buy them all Necessaries for the Wedding; but   
the sharp
Western Widow <font>Scramble</font> , is a Jewel.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? <font>Rafee</font> !
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She and her Quarter-master Capt. <font>Slice</font> did the   
business, <font>Slice</font> gets old
Aforesaid the Attorney's Daughter <font>Nell</font> with Bastard, the old     
Rogue sends her to
the <font>West Indies</font> , then marries <font>Scramble</font> , and she has clapt  
him into a <font>Mad house</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Get in that Debt immediately, take care of that    
same Quarter-master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No fear -- I have them both under <font>Black</font> and      
<font>White</font> , <font>Wax</font> and <font>Parchment</font> ,
<font>Lock</font> and <font>Key</font> ; I'm her Trustee, the Money is order'd, and as 
much more as takes
off all the Trash in my Cellar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now <font>Rafe</font> , to satisfie thee, things are better 
than thou think'st, for lift
up that Cloath, there's an <font>Indian</font> Cabinet worth 80 Pound sent me 
from 
<font>Rump-Enough</font> the <font>Dutchman</font> , in it <font>Indian</font> Silks,           
<font>Flanders</font> Lace, <font>Holland</font> and Muslin
enough to Rig me like a Queen this 7 Years, and as many              
<font>Bank-Bills</font> as will twice
pay <font>Goatherd</font> our Roguish Merchant.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O the Confounded <font>Low-Country</font> Miser! Who could    
have thought it of
him. But <font>Jenny</font> , What hast thou done for this? -- A bold         
Question! Ha -- Well,
no Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay Sir, What am I to do for it, for that's the    
Matter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>R.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, that's as thou pleasest to make out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rafee</font> , Don't look so surly; Why that I can    
Child; Look here!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>R.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Bless me! it's his own Hand too, the plainest Instructions 
that ever Satan's
Plenipotentiaries manag'd since <font>Amboyna</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, hearty ones, first to rob thee, get all the   
Money I cou'd, then to
follow him to <font>Holland</font> , and for fear of thy Loving or Violent    
Temper to leave
this Cordial Powder in thy Guts, which in a Week wou'd have sent     
thee to
another World, as surely as a brace of Balls thro' thy Head; he was  
his
Crafts-Master, and had learnt it of his Country Men, when at their   
<font>Indian Batavia</font> ,
thither we were to go, and from thence to some Delightful            
<font>Islands</font> , where he
was to Govern, and to be a Queen at least, till he was pleas'd to    
Spice my Porridge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>R.</nonSpeech><dialogue> O hellish Usurer, this Cabinet and the Contents thereof    
were put to
Interest for a Notable Return. But how didst get into his Confidence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Out-side, thro' his Eyes into his Heart, as  
he said, and by my
Wit into his Imagination. He Sacramented I should out-blaze all      
<font>India</font> , that
Monarchs would be proud to lie at my Feet: O my Conscience, now it   
comes
into my Head, the Dog wou'd have sold me to some sad-Colour'd        
<font>Mamamouchi</font> ;
He lov'd Money excessively, was above 50 Years old, and certainly    
had much
more Occasion for that, than such a Thing as I. This Tide, and this  
Wind will
in two days waft him to <font>Holland</font> , whither such a Scrole shall be 
sent, as may
make him wish himself in <font>India</font> before that time, and perhaps     
make a farther
Penny of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>R.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Content. Now <font>Jenny</font> , I'll tell thee what made our      
other Merchant, Sir
<font>Flat-face Puppy</font> , scatter Words and Threats about my Credit, to  
make thee
Uneasy, and endeavour to make me Ridiculous.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll be hang'd if 'twan't thy damned Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>R.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Even so. Thou knowest he is a Knave, a Coward, and a       
peevish Ass;
One that I guess'd since to be his Concubine, lik'd my Person and    
Chat at the
Wells, and was smart upon him. I knowing him, seconded it, compar'd  
him to
a Monks Flat Phyz, in an old Cathedral Window, his <font>Bum</font> to a      
<font>Base-Viol</font> and
his gate to a swimming Pig, and his whole Person, to the red and     
yellow
Pictures of <font>Some body, and no body</font> in a Country Alehouse; some   
Spy upon her
I suppose publish'd it. I don't owe the Dog 50 <font>l.</font> and defy him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou fool of a Wit; employ thy Sense in thy        
Profession to get Wealth
and Pleasure at other Peoples Expence, and joyn with me in carrying  
on our
Happiness, and in order to it, I will ever be Loving to thee and Easy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>R.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And silent! And for thy sake I will be Diligent and        
Industrious.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And blind! -- Hold, What Noise is that in the next 
Room!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>R.</nonSpeech><dialogue> O my Soul, these Dogs the Drawers have left it open, some  
body came
thither from to'ther Room. Ay by <font>Jove</font> ! A Gentleman in Red goes  
down
Laughing, and puts a Paper and Pencil into his Pocket.

</dialogue> <head><font>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN MR.</font> NEHEMIAH TRAP, <font>A REFORMER OF
MANNERS, AND CAPT.</font> FLOURISH, <font>AN OFFICER IN THE GUARDS</font> .</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Captain, I am glad of the Honour of your     
Company to
this Choice Glass of Wine. I wish I had as good Company to
Entertain you with, as you had when you Treated me at the
Tower.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt. F.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thank you Landlord; then send for your Wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O dear Captain, Would she were here, I'm sure     
she'd go all over the
Town to wait on you; but she is at my Neighbour <font>Smuggle's</font>        
Child's Christning,
he sent me this Wine; I'll assure you it never came near either      
Cooper's or
Vintner's Cellar.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, nor the Queen's Custom-house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pooh, no words -- Sincerely, my Friend is as      
pretty a Trader as --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ever sung <font>Psalms</font> , kept a <font>Sabbath</font> , or   
Cheated his <font>Prince</font> or <font>Neighbour</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, we have it. No matter how.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As you have your Estates and Credit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll say it sincerely, my Friend <font>Smuggle</font> is 
one of my <font>Brother
Reformers</font> , and understands Godliness notably.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the Plague of all that know him, that are  
not in the Secret of
his Gains.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. Trap.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Sir, Sincerely he was much mov'd, and really 
so was I, at the
two Swearing young Ensigns at the Guard, and the black young         
Gentlewoman their Coz. that began Bumpers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I plaid the young Rake and their Damsel at the   
Hypocritical Puppy;
but sincerely Landlord of mine, for all your Reformation, you wou'd  
have met
the <font>Bowsy Madamoiselle</font> privately; but the Jade was too Drunk to  
understand her
own Interest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sincerely you Scandalize me; it was only to give  
her good Counsel;
but however no words to my Wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, if she knows you not, she understands    
her self I hope;
but your brother Rogue, tho' he can stand a Chance Oath, or a Smutty 
word
slipt in Gentlemens Company; yet you both cou'd dispence with most   
beastly
Lewdness in his dirty Confederate Rogues of <font>Rumney Marsh</font> , and   
the two
<font>Brandy Kentish</font> Strumpets, when you brought me Sick up in the     
Pleasure-boat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O dear Sir, People that are Employed in business  
will have their
Frolicks sometimes, and must be humoured.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But if a poor Officer that can't say his Life's  
his own for 3 Months,
gets a Glass Extraordinary, Swears by Chance at some unmannerly      
Whelp, and
goes Singing to his Lodging; then it's, O the Debauchery of these    
Soldiers!
the <font>Protestant</font> Cause can never prosper with such Fighters for    
it; 'twas otherwise
in the Protector's time; when Landlord, thou art sensible, I know    
thou comest
home well loaden five days in the Week from the Tavern.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay with Moderation --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is just on this side of Reeling, with 3      
Bottles in your Guts, a
grave Look, and a Hickup, and perhaps a Knavish Bargain in your      
Pocket-book.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you would not have a Man serious and follow   
his Dealing with
Industry?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt, for you get by it. Faith Landlord, my   
Ensign would
change his Colours for your Gains in the Company you are free of,    
and I would
Swap my Commission for your Profits, in being a Top Parish Officer and
Reformer, besides Gut-Stuffing, and Guzzle into the bargain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fy, fie, I fack no such matter -- But who made    
you so wise Captain?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Even your own bragging sweet Self in your         
Moderation, and your
Spouse when you plague her with your Hypocrisy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish she had a greater Sense of the             
<font>Protestant</font> Party and Reformation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt. Fl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is a Gentlewoman born, well bred, and     
sensible, and abhors the
Canting and base Cruelty of your Reformers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, you owe her a good word, you always have    
hers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thank her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay seriously, since you have Lodg'd in my House, 
my Wife is twice as
good Conditioned to me as she was before, and says you are the       
Orderliest Lodger
in the World, and are always at Home when I am Sotting, as she calls 
it, at the Club.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly Mr. <font>Trap</font> , you are the greatest         
corrupter of Youth, and the most
dangerous Person I come near; for I never drink more nor in worse    
Company
than yours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you of the several Gentlewomen that    
us'd to come to you
3 or 4 times a Week, to be Treated with your Cordial Water.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pooh, my Soldiers Wives, Fool, that come about    
Business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! in Silks, Sattin and Silver, tho indeed   
sometimes a
Handsome one would come like a Servant <font>Maid</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Soldiers, like <font>Smuggle</font> and you, have more  
Trades than one, and
maintain them well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but since my Wife perswaded you, I thank     
you, you order them
to come to you upon the Guard about business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am willing to make any Family easie where I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Heavens reward you for it, that I have found. 
Come, here's
honest <font>Smuggle's</font> Health.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, his Wives with all my Heart. Why are not you  
Gossip?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He would have had me, but Mrs. <font>Smuggle</font> would  
have young Mr. <font>Smyrna</font>
the <font>Turkey</font> Merchant's Beau Prentice, and Monsieur <font>de la        
Fripponniere</font> the <font>French</font>
Merchant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, that Synagogue fac'd <font>Hugonot</font> , that     
from a Footman became a
Pocket Pedlar for Table-books and Tweezers at Noblemens Levys, then a
Peruke-Maker and Wine-brewer, next an Alamode Runner, and now dub'd a
Merchant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O dear Captain, you come too home to Folks        
Originals, you are a
notable Satyrical Wit. I fack, I love Sharpness; and my Wife says    
you are
like the <font>Plain Dealer</font> in the Play, and for that she values you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is so far in the right, that I am as great a  
Bubble and Fool as he, and
am as often teazed with damned Company; But why are not you at the   
Christning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For five Reasons, my dear Capt. First, my         
<font>Nelly</font> ordered me to Treat
you. Next, there is one I do not care to see till a Scurvy business  
is made up
between us. Thirdly, Mrs. <font>Smuggle</font> rails at me ever since our     
<font>Kentish</font> Voyage
<pagebreak id="7" />
with those merry Women, which she got an <font>Item</font> of; And next I     
expect three
Constables, five Informers, and my <font>Brother Reformer</font> Justice      
<font>Peerwell</font> ; and then
an old rich Merchant's only Son is to have some Dealings with me,    
and Coll.
<font>Plater</font> of <font>Spring-garden</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really all very good ones: I was Invited, but     
would not go; the Men
I don't like, and the Women I can wait on another time, and to Night 
must go
to <font>Windsor</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, <font>Captain</font> , here's to the Confederates.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay the Queen's Health with all my Soul, and       
Prosperity to her Arms.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh Captain, if your Success in War went on as     
briskly against the
French, as our Reformation of Manners does against Whores, Swearers, 
and
<font>Sunday</font> Taverns, it would be brave.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I wish we could lay the <font>French</font> and        
<font>Spanish</font> under as good Contribution,
as you do your sinful Tributaries, and it would save 12 <font>d.</font> in    
the Pound Tax at least.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Supposing it true; the Wicked should be punished  
all manner of ways.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not with greater Wickedness; for, Conniving at    
Sin for Gain, Selling
of Justice, ensnaring of Innocents, and often Oppressing those who   
have no
Money; putting some into such Places of admirable Improvement, that  
those
who went in only <font>Whores</font> , come out <font>Whores</font> and <font>Thieves</font> ,  
is as bad as the
Crimes they are Committed for.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Zeal for Reformation may be excused, if it carry   
a Man a little too far.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, to the fulfilling his Pride, Malice, and     
Ill-nature, as well as his
Covetousness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So -- Satyrical Captain; And have you nothing to  
say against strict
keeping the Sabbath?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Mr. <font>Jew</font> , you have my free Leave to go to  
the Devil as painfully
as an <font>Indian</font> Jogue, or a <font>Capuchin</font> Fryer. Only of all things  
a Generous
Temper abhors a Hypocrite.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would you have no Reformation?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, our Laws are good and ought to have better   
Executors of them,
than such as you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very sharp.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. Very true. You may seem another Man to your   
Brethren, who
won't know you; or your Bubbles, who don't know you; or your         
Subjects who
dare not know you. But my dear Landlord, Here's to thy own           
Reformation
and Health. I do know thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter, but I have so good a Cause as I dare    
Argue it out with you.
Come, dear Capt. put off your Journey to <font>Windsor</font> till to Morrow. 
I have a Neat
Supper; here is more of this Wine; my Wife is a coming, and she      
shall be Judge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Content, provided you Teaze me no more with your  
Seizing, Gaoling,
Fining, Whipping, and Reformation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Agreed. <font>Smuggle</font> and I will put off our going   
down the River till four
a Clock to morrow Morning. Shall I send for him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No -- As good Friends as we are, and as much as I 
love Diversion, I
won't trust my self with Two of you at a time together; and then we  
should
not be upon the Square neither, unless I could get <font>Titus O--</font> the 
late Lord <font>Sund--</font>
or the Devil to keep my back-hand.

   <nonSpeech> <font>C. F.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I am glad you are come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I am as glad I am come from such Odious        
Company, to so good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Nelly</font> , thou art to be Judge between the       
Captain and I about
Reformation of Manners. The Capt. has put off his Journey. I've got  
a good Supper,
and We'll enjoy our selves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you don't sour it with the Relation of your  
Noble Campaign to
<font>Trappanning, Jayls, Whippings</font> , and <font>Robbing</font> at the Head of   
your <font>Mirmidon
Informers</font> , and <font>Catch-Poles</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Madam, You are to see fair play, he is to      
maintain his Cause decently,
and has promis'd to Teize us no more with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my heart; nay I could bear with all    
his wicked Stuff for
your Conversation; upon my Life I have need of something Agreeable,  
I'm
almost burst with the Vapours, rais'd by abominable Doings at the     
Christning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Won't a Relation of the Impertinences      
continue them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: You Men will be apt to say I am so much a   
Woman, that
Reflections upon the <font>Ridicule</font> , will be a <font>Prescription</font> to    
contribute to the <font>Cure</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now we are going to have my <font>Brother Smuggle</font>    
pull'd to pieces, because
he is no Roistering Spark; but the Comfort is, he is a Man of        
Substance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A man of the Devil! -- Substantially wicked,    
I'm sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope your Relation will be a Lesson to Mr.      
<font>Trap</font> , to shew how Wealth
that's Got Knavishly, is Spent as Foolishly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You Two were expected, for the People there     
were a Select
Company, as he call'd it, at this private Christning. First The      
<font>Occasional Divine</font>
that can dispence with the Cross, and all Ceremonies and Order as    
well as
<pagebreak id="9" />
Honesty. Then Spruce Mr. <font>Smyrna</font> , Monsieur                       
<font>de la Fripponniere</font> , <font>Mongrell</font> the
Inn-keeper, and Owler of <font>Rumney Marsh</font> ; Mrs. <font>Goggle</font> the Mrs. 
of the <font>Phanatick
Boarding-School</font> , <font>Rachel</font> her Leering Daughter, and             
<font>Satanago</font> the <font>Jew</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a <font>Jew</font> at a <font>Christian's</font> Baptism, O    
monstrous!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I believe he would have had him been       
Godfather.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why not; we've lately seen <font>Jews</font> made          
Embassadors and Knights.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly then I interpos'd, and was forced to     
Swagger down right
with the Beast <font>Smuggle</font> , to have him kept out of the Room during 
the Service,
while in the mean time, as I guess'd by the bustle over head, he was 
Russling
one of the Maids.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We go to their Ceremonies; Why should not they       
come to ours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay thou countest them both alike.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I urg'd and repeated to him it was a      
Shame to Christianity,
he replied as fast, He was a good Man, and worth 30000 Pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you well Treated?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most profusely: Mrs. <font>Smuggle</font> and           
<font>Smyrna</font> had order'd it nicely,
only <font>Fripponniere</font> that was never brought up to any thing but     
<font>Barly-Bread</font> , <font>Garlick</font> ,
and <font>Wooden Shoes</font> , with his <font>French</font> Impudent Nonsense found   
fault with every
thing, till I was forced to take him up a little roundly about his   
own Original
and Education, and I think I work'd a Miracle, that is, Silenced     
him, and put a
mixture of <font>Brick</font> Colour into his Phillamot Countenance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What become of the <font>Levite</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He Eat and Drank devoutly, receiv'd his        
Present, squees'd and
whisper'd Mrs. <font>Rachel</font> most vehemently, made an Assignation with  
her, and
went his way first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art to Censorious.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were too Foolish, for she pull'd out a    
Table-Book and
Scribbled, and he call'd for a Pen and Ink below Stairs, before he   
went out, so
fearful were they both to forget the precious Moment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was thy Part?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you, <font>Mr, Inquisitive</font> ;           
<font>Beau Smyrna</font> made Love to me
with ends of Tag'd Lines, shewing his Teeth, and Diamond Ring, which
with a fine parcel of <font>China</font> , and a rare Pad, he said he would   
present me; I
very honestly and innocently went and told <font>Mrs. Smuggle</font> , to ask 
her Advice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good, and she fell into Fits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Exactly; So poor <font>Smyrna</font> fled the Pit, and  
was forced to go down
Stairs and Drink in his own defence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What became of <font>Fripponiere</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told you before, he had too much of my       
Conversation, as he
call'd it, but the Tawny Satyr finding <font>Mrs. Rachel</font> engag'd, flew 
at the old
Midwife and <font>Mrs. Goggle</font> , hugg'd them up most vigorously, and    
after an
admirable medly of Discourse of railing at the <font>English</font> making    
Love, and
Persecution, it ended in an appointment of a private Meeting with    
<font>Goggle</font> , which <font>Mrs.
Smuggle</font> over-hearing Scolded as vehemently at him, as before she   
Cry'd about
<font>Smyrna</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Grammecy, pious <font>Refugee</font> , he flies as briskly 
at Game of all Ages, as
he does at all sorts of Trade, Diamonds and old Shoes.
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did my Brother <font>Smuggle</font> behave himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why he talk'd impudently to Mrs. <font>Goggle</font> ,  
and she answer'd him
with as lewd Meanings in the Godly Phrase; he prais'd the            
Resemblance of his
Child, which was no more like him than I am to a Negro, 'twas the    
Picture of
<font>Smyrna</font> ; and then went down to drink with the <font>Jew</font> , the      
<font>Owler</font> , and his Pimp
the Livery Stables-Man by <font>Moor-fields</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What pity it was you could not hear their blessed 
Conversation!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, indeed I did, for I got into <font>Mrs.       
Smuggle's China</font> Closet in
the drawing Room, and heard all; but such a Confusionn of Villanous  
Stuff did
I never hear before; the <font>Kentish</font> Fellow Swore like a Tinker, and 
Sung Songs as
Nasty as himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not my Neighbour reprove him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, till he began to publish some of          
<font>Smuggle's</font> Female
Adventures, for which his Champion the Horsecourser and he had like  
to have gone
to Loggerheads but then they came to a Composition; for the          
<font>Owler</font> by the
help of a preparative Mornings Draught of Punch fell asleep, and     
Spew'd upon
the <font>Damask</font> Couch
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How far'd the <font>Beau</font> ? His Pippin Pate can't    
bear Drink.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Drunk he was, and fell foul upon <font>Satanago</font>  
for his buying two
<font>Phanatick</font> Fatherless pretty Sisters of <font>Mrs. Goggle</font> , they    
were her Half-boarders,
she prefered them to him to be his Hand-Maids, one at his City, the  
other at
his Country House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVhat said the Unbeliever?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He cry'd it was meer Scandal, That they were   
to be Richly
married to two of his Nation in <font>Holland</font> ; and meer spight in     
<font>Smyrna</font> , because he
had out-bid him, and got from him the Exchange VVoman's fair Hair'd
Prentice Girl.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very whimsical Controversy!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Beau</font> then swore he'd Cuckold the       
<font>Hebrew</font> with all three of
them; and the enraged <font>Jew</font> bid him if he durst, he'd get his      
Master and
Father acquainted with his way of Living; and what was worse, swore  
in <font>French</font> ,
which the others understood not, That he would let <font>Mrs. Smuggle</font>  
know of his
Intentions, which immediately silenced the <font>Beau</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Frenchman staid above?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, till he had made his Peace with a Gold    
Snuff-Box; but I
believe it will cost poor <font>Smirna</font> all he proffered me, before his 
angry Lady
Regent will receive him into Grace, she has a notable way of         
managing with
her; one would not think one with no more Education than she had by  
being
an Alderman's Ladies Chamber-Maid, should be such a Politician.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam, the Lady has, I presume, a double stock  
of Love about her,
she is doubly or trebly Mann'd to dispose of that Treasure, and must 
needs
have a double Portion, of what you call high Spirit, to govern her   
Subjects.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you call it, Captain?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We Men are uncomplaisant Creatures, and may give  
it the course Name
of Devilism.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right, Captain, sincerely a Woman might be         
contented with Letchery,
and not add Malice, Wrath, and Covetousness to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Foul Mouth, hold your scurvy Tongue. When the   
Monsieur came down,
<pagebreak id="11" />
<font>Smirna</font> was sent for up; but, I guess, the business was not       
ended, for he's to
have his Charge tomorrow, when <font>Smuggle</font> goes out of Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did <font>Fripponniere</font> make up the Chorus?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most admirably; for from Ribaldry above        
Stairs, Drink put
him into a Fit of Zeal below, he Drank, he Swore, and talk'd Bawdy,  
and <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT HAS and and AT LINE BREAK</comment> 
all for the <font>Protestant</font> Religion, Contradicted every body,        
Interrupted all that
spoke, till he and the <font>Jew</font> fell into a close Conference in       
French, about Pimping
for an old Peer, and bubling a Countess in a Diamond Necklace; and   
then I
left them Drunk, Mrs. <font>Smuggle</font> in Fits for her Lovers, Mrs.       
<font>Goggle</font> in Vapours
for too much Liquour, and <font>Rachel</font> stealing from her, and the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to our Argument?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, Sir, none of your Fustian till after     
Supper, it may chance

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You see, Madam, what reason I had, not to be      
there considering the Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very true, either the Fops Impertinence, the   
Frenchman's
Impudence, or the rest of the Knaves might have provok'd your        
Resentment, for they
have no more Manners than Honesty, or else you'd have sat silent,    
for your
Conversation with them would have made as unnatural a peice of       
Patchwork
as Velvet <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Vevet</comment> and Brocade upon a Hop-Sack.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But sincerely, <font>Satanago</font> is Master of           
Languages, and an ingenious Fellow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So is many a Fellon in <font>Newgate</font> , must he   
therefore be Convers'd with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is very Rich, who knows but he may be Knighted?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not in this Reign, I'm sure, <font>English</font>       
Honours will no more be
prostituted to Foreign Wretches and Infidels.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard that upon my Lord <font>Ready-Money

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fancy it will make a pretty Figure in        
History hereafter,
especially when a <font>Dutch</font> Tapster improv'd into a Gamster, should  
be farther improv'd
into a Baronet for being a private Spy, and a publick Adulterer;     
when Titles
and the Noblest Ensigns of Honour are given to such as have no       
Father, or --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sacred Robes to a Foreigner that has no Religion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right, Captain, it will look as Ridiculous as  
putting the Sinews of
War into the Hands of a Profligate Unaccountable, as well as         
Unaccounting
Bankrupt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a Fool, forsooth; What care People for Satyr 
when they have Money?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVell said, Mammon; And do these Money-mongers    
care for any but
themselves? VVhat good will the <font>Jew's</font> or <font>Smuggles</font> VVealth do 
you? I dare
say, neither will make you their Heir, nor because they are wealthy  
can you
hope to buy a better Bargain of them, indeed by joining in indirect  
Practices with
them, they may clap a <font>Leven</font> into that part of your Wealth that   
is honestly gotten.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, <font>Captain</font> , I will have Conversation,  
aye and Dealing too, left
off with them both, especially <font>Smuggle</font> , and rather than want of 
Profit should
be an Excuse, I, for my share of it, will go in Sack-Cloath, feed upon
Ship-Bisquet, and lie in a Thatcht Cottage rather than have the      
Reputation
of my Husband Linck'd with that of two such Villains.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fairly Offer'd, Madam. Faith, Mr. <font>Trap</font> ,      
you'll not find many such
VVives; I am sure <font>Smuggle</font> would not do so.
<pagebreak id="12" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> VVell, I agree to it, and must own, That with such 
Gain, there are
such Hazards that shall be nameless, which I'll run no longer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For Mrs. <font>Smuggle</font> , it was my Husbands       
importunity made me
acquainted with her; The violent Temper, base Principles, and foul   
Feeding of
that Lady, made me ever have an Aversion for her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some such Spouses, I suppose, gave occasion to    
that old Languag'd
<font>French</font> Sonnet Monsieur <font>Bruyere</font> praises so much, it is a good 
one, and I promised
you to get it translated, because, tho' a Satyr on your Sex, you     
lik'd it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O good Captain! I'm sure you did not go far to  
have it done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't Scandalize me with the Imputation of Rhime.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember I have heard you quote a <font>Spanish</font> 
Saying, That <font>a
Gentleman was an Ass that could not make a Stanza, and a Coxcomb if  
he made a Hundred</font> .
As well as I love it, I think <font>Poetry</font> is an agreeable

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You're a notable Judge. I believe Supper's      
ready; but pray Mr. <font>Trap</font> ,
don't let us be interrupted by any of the Brutes that us'd to come   
to you at this

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have left word below I'm abroad; tho' the whole

Villain? I must have him
and all his doings put into the Stipulation with his Yoake-Mate      
<font>Smuggle</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right, Madam. And, Sir, if I should chance to see 
you with that
Scandal of Mankind, you will give me leave to disown you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Neh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay, I don't appear publickly with such Folks   
-- But here is our Supper.
<pagebreak id="13" />
</dialogue> <head> <font>CAPT.</font> FLOURISH, <font>MR.</font> TRAP, <font>AND MRS.</font> TRAP.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now, <font>Captain</font> , will you not own that the     
Land needs Reforming from
Swearing, Whoring, Drinking and Sabbath-breaking, of the Soldiery
and Gentry?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, as well as from <font>Lying, Cheating,           
Forswearing, Hypocrisy,
Envy, Heresy</font> , and <font>Constant Moderate Bibbing</font> of the Trading    
Sober part of the Nation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We put our helping Hand to Reformation, if you    
did your
Endeavour so --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Every one speak in his own Station. My Soldiers   
dare no more Swear
in my Presence, than your Prentice in yours; and when my Subalterns, 
or
Staff Officers give me the Character of an Incorrigible foul Mouth'd 
Swearer, he is Stript and Cashier'd for a Profligate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But <font>Whoring</font> , Captain, <font>Whoring</font> , How is   
that Punished?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By the <font>Pox</font> , <font>Trap</font> , the <font>Pox</font> ; That is 
a Feat is seldom done in
Publick, but if a Rake does discover his Sin by the Punishment, then 
(as it is said
in <font>Sir Fopling</font> ) I assure you he Rots for an Example.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But the <font>Sabbath</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they are upon Duty, they don't break it, and 
when
off, the Churchwardens and Constables look after them like other     
People,
and I believe there are as many Prentices and Journeymen taken and   
punished,
as Soldiers; As for Drinking, much more, for they have more Money to 
spend
out of Two Shillings or Half a Crown a day, than a Soldier his Two   
Pence out of Six
for <font>Geneve</font> , or now and then a Cup of good Liquor out of 2       
<font>s.</font> from a Horseman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>N. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And the Officers who looks after them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can answer but for one positively, but can give 
a pretty good Guess
at those I think worth my Friendship and Acquaintance. Come Mr.      
<font>Trap</font> , <font> <foreign>ad 
Hominem</foreign> </font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Laughs) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> let your Lady be judge who is      
wickedest of us two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thank you <font>Captain</font> for your Complement, a    
fine Office to make me
sit Umpire and Chief Justice upon Sin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Madam, I make your Breast the Court of Equity  
for Innocence,
and stand so much on my Justification, that I appeal as far as       
Appearances, (and
that's what he most covets to save) even to the Spouse of his Bosom, 
one who
is a Gentlewoman and no Reformer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Name makes me sick and choaks me with the   
Spleen. I think
the <font>Capt.</font> may as well go to his General's Levee, air himself on  
Horse-back, or in
a Coach, and make innocent Visits, as you retire to be serious, that 
is
overhawl and cast up the Books and Accounts of the whole Week, write 
Letters, or
consult with the other two of <font>Belzebubs</font> Triumvirate,             
<font>Smuggle</font> , and <font>Satanago</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I go to Church, and give a good Example.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes <font>Mr. Occasional</font> , and as often to a        
Schismatical Meeting, where,
for ought you know, the Wretched un-ordain'd <font>Canter</font> may be a     
<font>Jesuite</font> , and you
write Sermons too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prais'd be Heaven I can, and repeat them to my   
Family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Remember who was overlook'd when the Text in your 
Sermon-Book
was the good Ship <font>Rebecca</font> , whom God preserve, bound to           
<font>Pensilvania</font> with the
Invoices and Bills of Lading. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Scandal --
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truth, for I'm a Witness to it as well as the  
Captain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose you'd fain have Musick a <font>Sundays</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so fain as you'd have it out of the         
Cathedrals; but pray is not
an Innocent Air on the Violin, as harmless as two Dozen Pipes of     
Tobacco
extraordinary on a <font>Sunday</font> , when your <font>Reformation</font> don't let  
you go a Pinting
as you do all the Week.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is Uncharitable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay <font>Trap</font> , I'll commend thy Zeal, rather than 
Charity, that will sooner
give five Shillings to have a poor Devil Whip'd or Stock'd, than six 
pence to
Relieve a poor Starving Family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And the Play-Houses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's much to be said against them, and         
something for them, only, I
have observ'd the Closest Bargains have been made between            
<font>Damsels</font> and grave
<font>Camblet Cloaks</font> in the <font>Middle Gallery</font> , and Un-Sworded        
<font>Esquires</font> and Mask'd <font>Lady
Errants</font> in the <font>Pit</font> , and the Passages to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And all the Ladies of <font>Drury-Lane</font> ,          
<font>Covent-Garden</font> -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wou'd
quickly go to Service, hard Labour, or the Plantations, if the       
wealthy
Contributions from Sly, grave, Transgressors, did not uphold them; A 
Rake can't pay,
and his very Acquaintance blows up the little gawdy Sinner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, What wou'd you Reform in Us People of     
Business?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> First, the imprudent Education of your Children,  
you either breed 'em
<font>Fops</font> , or private <font>Rakes</font> and open <font>Hypocrites</font> , make the   
young Fellows Prove
without <font>Brains</font> and <font>Sense</font> , and the worst <font>Husbands</font> in the 
World. And the young
Women Half-bred, Vain and Proud, and the worst Wives in the Universe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What for our Wives!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They Marry for Covetousness and Vanity, and are   
justly punish'd for
it in you. I'll leave you and <font>Mrs. Trap</font> to read <font>Lectures</font> on  
all the <font>Mrs.
Smuggles</font> of your Acquaintance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let your <font>Sons</font> and <font>Prentices</font> leave off     
their Galloping <font>Horses</font> and <font>Hunters</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Their Expensive Journeys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, till they learn to Cheat as well as Trade by 
Whole-Sale, that is,
break. Their <font>Epsom</font> Expeditions, and all the little               
<font>Bawdy Inns</font> , and
<font>Warren-Houses</font> about <font>Epping-Forrest</font> and <font>Enfield-Chace</font> .   
Not forgetting some Naval
Expeditions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay Sir --? Then I am resolv'd you shall Sell   
your Share in that
cursed Yatch.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you Neighbour <font>Trap</font> , if you Cheated her  
Majesty in her Customs no
more than I in my Musters, you need not be in Subjection to several  
dirty Rascals.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Leave off that odious Practice, or by my Life,  
I'll peach thee my
self tho' I starve.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then for the <font>Jews</font> . <font>Mr. Trap</font> , they are   
no Reformers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Tr.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare Swear -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let their      
Brother Knaves take them to Task
with their Servants, Wenches, and Concubines, they're not content to 
make them
forfeit their Virtue and Modesty, but they must farther <font>Debauch</font>  
them, to
clench their <font>Damnation</font> , and renounce their <font>Christianity</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O horrible! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You'll hear more of 
that hereafter; a Generous
Convert from them has promis'd to lay open the Iniquities of Satan's 
Factors,
that Trade by Commission from the Devil. There are as many Laws in   
force
against <font>Judaism</font> as <font>Whoring</font> .
<pagebreak id="15" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was thy Chief End in making thy self a     
Publick Nuisance,
that is such a kind of Reformer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll spare him the Labour of Speaking and         
Blushing too, it was to be
before-hand with the World, that it might not observe him: to gain   
the
Confidence of a Party he thought most to his Interest to be talk'd   
of for such things,
rather than for Closer, I do not say worse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, his Breeding, first under a <font>Phanatick    
Master</font> , and afterwards
his <font>Education</font> in that Virtuous Place, <font>Amsterdam</font> , had rarely 
fitted him for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He found it was easier to be a Censurer of other  
People, and a
Pharasaical <font>Sabbath Keeper</font> , than a Man of Justice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I read good Books, and enquire into Religion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have a care of your enlarg'd Thoughts, your       
<font>Dutch</font> and <font>Scotch</font>
Linsie-Woolsey <font>Divinity</font> . There are many of you that             
Coxcomically aim at
Learning, and Read without Guides, till you have blunder'd thro' all 
Reveal'd
Religion. A <font>Deist</font> is a Jewel to many of you; but it's not fit to 
publish what I
know on that Subject.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Life, <font>Mr. Trap</font> , you're worsted.      
Come, take our Advice,
Live like an <font>Englishman</font> , a good Natur'd Man, and a Gentleman,   
reform your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Capt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And if a Preacher in Red that desires to be thy   
Friend, may be believ'd,
thou wilt find an easy Temper, a clear Conscience, a sound got       
Estate, much
more comfortable than the Applauses of Villains, indirect Dealings,  
and the <font>Cries</font>
and <font>Curses</font> of the Oppress'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Captain, we have conquer'd, he's gone           
confounded; I'll pursue the
Blow, and I hope he'll be convinc'd, and Honest, and Easy, and I     
Happy hereafter.

<pagebreak id="16" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, your humble Servant, I'm glad of your    
good Company;
a Fellow Travellor of your Fashion will make me Amends for my
five Miles Pennance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I believe your Pennance will continue, for 
Women generally
help to make your Sex Uneasy, at least if we may believe you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why Madam, that's as they are; but my Deaf and  
Dumb Neighbour
wou'd make a much better Wife than a Companion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you think they can't be found in one. God  
help our Sex since
the Generality of Mankind have such an Opinion of us; it's in vain   
for us to
hope for one that's a Husband and Friend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Education fits Mankind for Friendship,   
your soft Sex is
design'd for Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O wretched! If both Love and Friendship are not 
so united both in
Man and Woman, as never to be parted. But, Sir, I never experienc'd  
either,
Love has not yet reach'd me, I frankly own; Nor have I ever found    
such a
Treasure as a Friend, but in my Relations; Yet I should be glad to   
be inform'd
what sort of Education that is which fits your Sex for so Noble a    
Thing as
<font>Friendship</font> is describ'd to be in the few Books I've read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why Madam, Do you ever read?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, it's suppos'd I don't always say my         
<font>Prayers</font> without Book.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I mean, Madam, for Improvement of the Mind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I can't tell; What if only for Amusement   
and Diversion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam! That indeed best becomes your Lovely   
Sex, and most
Lovely self, the rest should be left to us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O barbarous! This is like <font>Julian</font> the        
Apostate; you'd use the
Women as bad as he did the <font>Christians</font> , and deprive them of the  
Advantages of
Learning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord Madam, you are vers'd in Antiquity! Don't    
you understand <font>Latin</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really no Sir, I have not that Happiness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a Happiness indeed which I often pity you 
Women have not for
your Improvement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Does it make one Wittier or Wiser?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O yes, by knowing the Antient Poets, Orators,   
and Philosophers.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, That's their Wit and Wisdom you read, and  
not yours; but we
have it in their Translated Books. Must their Sense always go along  
with their
Language?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ever Madam, the Spring head, the Fountain is    
only to be valued,
and those who imbibe from thence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then there never was a Wity or Wise Man, or one 
to be valued, but
who understood <font>Latin</font> or <font>Greek</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very true, the others are but a sort of         
Superficial Fellows, that only
take things upon Trust.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, with Submission, to pass away half an Hour 
of this ill Weather,
I'll Discourse this Matter a little; but I've one Favour to ask.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Any Madam, you may command me entirely. But what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is, that you'll keep your Temper; for I    
have heard a Noble
Friend of my Father's say, That he never met with Learned <font>Latin</font>  
and <font>Greek</font> 
Scholars, that ever cou'd have Patience when their Venerable         
Antiquity, <font>Latin</font> 
and <font>Greek</font> Languages were attack'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he was an illiterate Wretch, and           
understood them not; How
else durst he attempt such Impudent Nonsence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you Sir, how true a Prophet am I? You see  
you are not Proof
against it. Your Darlings and Favourites are no more to be touch'd,  
than a
Substantial Merchant's Credit, or a Soldier's Point of Honour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha! Madam, you've Caught me I own; but  
it's what
hitherto I'm a stranger to. I humbly beg your Pardon, you have free  
Liberty to
Scoundrel the most Venerable <font>Homer, Aristotle, Virgil</font> and         
<font>Horace</font> , and Scout the
Sacred Languages down to the degree of the Clucking of the <font>Cape</font>  
of <font>Good Hope</font> ,
<font>Hottentots</font> or <font>Gipsies</font> Cant; and use the Teachers and Readers 
of the Antient
Sages as Scurvily and unmercifully as --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Witty Woman does a mere Scholar. But Sir,     
this Gentleman
I mention'd, was both the Ornament, and a Happy Instrument of the    
State, a brave Soldier, a Wise Senator, Speaking and Writing three   
or four
Languages of <font>Europe</font> , a Traveller, and most useful Mathematician.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ch. Cl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! and not understand <font>Euclid</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Again Sir? May he not understand the Nature of  
a Circle, or a
Triangle, and Employ them to the Benefit of Mankind without the very 
Words
and Language of <font>Euclid</font> ; he was in Years when I saw him, and I   
not ten Years
of Age, and yet so Universal, Pleasant, and Agreeable a Man, that we
Children as much admir'd him as our Parents.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is a single Instance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's enough to make it possible; but had you  
convers'd with the
World half so much as your Authors, you'd find Numbers in the Glory  
and Prop of
our Nation, Navigation, and in the Revenues, Privy Council, Army,
Engineers, <font>&amp;c.</font> The <font>French</font> King did not fetch <font>Turene</font> or   
<font>Luxemburg</font> from the
College; Nor are his Forts, his Havens, and mighty Works built by    
School-masters,
<font>Horace-Mongers</font> , or <font>Homerians</font> , and our Noble and Wonderful  
Sir <font>Walter
Rawleigh</font> went young into the World, and owed most of the Great     
Knowledge he
had of <font>Greek</font> and <font>Latin</font> , to his barbarous Usage and Prison;  
his Gallant Actions
he performed without it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a Historian too, and give Admirable Instances.  
Surely
Madam, you must have read much.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No truly Sir, and never one line of <font>Latin</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> But Madam, How came the Gentleman you mention'd, (who   
by your
Ingenious Description must be a Great Man) to be destitute of the    
Learned
Languages?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As my Father told me, 'twas because he was bred 
under an
Impudent ill natur'd Rascal of a School-Master, one so much a Clown  
himself, he
either cou'd not find out, or hated the Gentlemen in another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, Scholars are not bred without Manners.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where shou'd they learn them? Among Lying,      
Orchard Robbing
Boys, or by Smoaking and Ale-Bibbing, or Capping in a Quadrangle:    
but this
<font>Latin</font> Thrasher, so Scourg'd and Buffetted Learning into him,     
that the Sound
of <font>Latin</font> was as Terrible to him, as <font>Turkish</font> and <font>Arabique</font> 
is to a <font>Spanish</font>
Sea-Coast Village at Midnight, when a small Fleet of <font>Moors</font> ,     
with their Musquets,
Cymetars, and Shackles surprize it. He hated a <font>Roman</font> as much as  
ever a <font>Russ</font>
or <font>Polander</font> did a <font>Tartar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Smartly express'd, but Madam, the <font>Romans</font> were the   
Worthiest and
Noblest People in the Universe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, witness their Gladiators, and beastly      
Dealing with their best
Prisoners of War. Not all the united Crimes of those Nations they    
call'd
barbarous, ever came up to it. But Sir, I shan't disparage your      
Friends, whose
Vertues you find in their own Poets; and the Christian Apologists,   
<font>Minntius</font> ,
<font>Foelix</font> , <font>Tertullian</font> , <font>Arnobius</font> , &amp;c. for they are in     
<font>French</font> . This Gentleman us'd to
say, The Cry of Fire in a Ship, of Surprize and Slaughter in a       
Beat-up Quarter,
which he afterwards experienc'd, made not that dismal Impression on  
him, as
the Grammar Rules when rattled over him by this evil Genius of        
<font>Syntaxis</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, 'tis impossible to learn a Language without      
Rules and
Grammar, and <comment type="compiler">ONLY &quot;d&quot; OF &quot;and&quot; VISIBLE IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> our Method 
of Teaching them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The general <comment type="compiler">ONLY &quot;neral&quot; OF &quot;The general&quot;

his wretched

SOURCE TEXT</comment> kept him seven Years, to learn to make Files, Axes,    
Hatchets,
Saws, Plains, and Hammars to do a Work but of two Years, when he     
might
have all his Tools made to his Hands. I guess'd at his Meaning, and  
imagine a
Language was made before Grammar, that does but Polish the Work, and
often spoil it. Pray Sir, how long were you at School?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Nine Years, Madam!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And were not you Scourg'd and Beaten?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Immoderately! Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you learn in that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Latin</font> and <font>Greek</font> , and to write a pretty   
Scurvy Scholar's Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose you speak them Accurately well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam, that's not usual, we don't speak them;   
that's a Custom but
of some Foreigners; Perhaps by practice with them, I cou'd be        
brought to
Speak them; tho' not so Readily, yet in a more Accurate Phrase. But  
we pretend
to Write and Understand an Author.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then for Speaking, you are to go to School      
again, I perceive. But
had you Arithmatick and Geography?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Madam, I learn'd since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I beg you'd pardon me the Impertinence of  
some Questions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Ingenuity and Goodness commands me, Madam.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you Speak, Read, and tolerably Write         
<font>French</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I have eight Months since, by the Help of  
a <font>Grammar,
Dictionary</font> , and a <font>French Refugee</font> , began to learn it, and can 
pick out the Meaning of an
Easy Author; but I can't pretend in a Year or two to hope to speak   
or write it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you Design, or Paint, and Japan, or Distill?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One requires a Genius for it, and Practice, and a 
good Master; and
the other I may know when I go through a Course of Chimistry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you Sew, Knit, Spin, Embroider, make Lace   
and Fringe; Silk
and Wax-Work; Dance, Sing, Play on the Harpsicord, Raise Paste,      
Preserve!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heavens! Madam, these are Womens Work.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet all these, I may without Vanity say, in     
less than four Years, I
learn'd, and never was once Scourged; and that you may not suspect   
any
Extraordinary Genius; a Dozen more Girles learned almost the same,   
and as well.
With almost any two of these, well apply'd to, I could gain an honest
Livelihood in most parts of <font>England</font> , <font>Scotland</font> ,             
<font>Ireland</font> , or the <font>Plantations</font> , where it's
probable the Lot of a Native of <font>England</font> may fall; with           
<font>French</font> , I am a stranger
in almost no Part of <font>Europe</font> . Sir, pray, should you be taken a   
Slave by an
<font>Algerine</font> , or a <font>Sally Man</font> , who have not the Fear and        
Reverence of <font>Latin, Greek</font> ,
and their Authors before their Eyes, What could you do, to save your 
self from
Drubbing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Work and Dig if I had my Limbs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That a <font>Negro</font> could do as well, who had      
never been Nine years at
School, to learn <font>Homer</font> , <font>Virgil</font> , <font>Horace</font> , and           
<font>Terence</font> . Suppose such a thing should
happen (for to as easy bred, and as well born as you it has) Would   
you not
willingly part with some of your <font>Metaphysicks</font> , <font>Logick</font> , old 
<font>Philosophy</font> , or <font>Latin</font> Poetry,
to be able to make a <font>Horse-Shoe</font> , a <font>Saddle</font> , or a <font>Pair of  
Boots</font> , to help to gain
your Liberty or Ease? And yet these are Learnt to Perfection in half 
the Time,
and with half the Expence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, you have almost confounded me; but our Learning  
is for
Ornament, and to Improve our Souls in Thought and Contemplation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We live in <font>England</font> , and speak              
<font>English</font> ; and I think <font>Milton</font> , <font>Dryden</font> ,
and <font>Cowley</font> , are as good Garniture for a Discourse as your       
<font>Latin</font> Poets, if
Ornament be your end; and our Souls by a few <font>Divinity</font> and        
<font>Moral</font> Books, may be
better fitted for Reflections on a future State, and our present     
Being, than by
either <font>Tully</font> or <font>Seneca</font> , they Spoke and Thought well; and we 
(Improved by
<font>Divine Revelation</font> ) Speak and Think much better. But Sir, should 
you chance
not to get a <font>Parsonage</font> , or not take to <font>Physick</font> , or the     
<font>Civil Law</font> , What would
you do with your Learning, even in <font>England</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Get a <font>Curacy</font> , or Teach <font>School</font> , or be a        
<font>Tutor</font> to some Gentleman's Son.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What might that gain you a Year?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps Forty, Fifty, or Sixty Pounds a Year.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What might your Father bestow on you a Year in    
order to your <font>Learning</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, at School for the Nine Years, from 12 to         
20 <font>l.</font> a Year; and at
the University, from 20 to 40 <font>l.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A hard Return for such Time and Expence! A good 
Workman of
a <font>Smith</font> in our Neighbourhood, is not yet 30 Years of Age, has    
got 80 <font>l. per
Ann.</font> Land, a <font>Sadler</font> 50, a <font>Tanner</font> 200. Two Masters of       
Ships, one a <font>West
Indian</font> , the other a <font>Baltick</font> Trader, are Worth each 1500       
<font>l.</font> All these, I've been
<pagebreak id="20" />
told, set out at the same time with my Brother, bred like you; but   
their
Parents had the Grace to take them from Uncharitable Learning, and   
he with his
Authors is not like to Improve his Moderate Estate a Penny, unless   
the
Government will be pleased to give him a sort of a Gentleman's       
<font>Sine Cure</font> , called
a Place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Air and Face, Madam, made at first an Extraordinary
Impression upon my poor Heart; but now your Wit and good Sense, your 
bright
Soul has quite Enchanted me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There it is, we can't displease in Discourse,   
but all our Sex are
Satyriz'd for our sakes; and if we chance to please, then Love is    
thrown about
at our Heads, as some do <font>Greek</font> and <font>Latin</font> for want of real    
Knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith Madam, it's a sign I have a real Value for  
you, to Esteem you
for making me an Ass, and showing I've been Bred, and spent my Time  
like
a Fool.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir, it's granted, I accept what you call  
your Esteem and Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Millions of Blessings and Ten Thousand Joys! --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold -- No Raptures, for I have no Fortune.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your self alone is Heav'n and All --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which will not buy me a Twelve-penny Stuff      
Mantua, you a Pair
of Shooes, or our Children Bread and Milk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To gain such a Felicity, What wou'd I not Attempt! What 
must I be
to gain you!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Ship-Carpenter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Heav'ns! That's so foreign to my Education, that I must 
begin the
World anew.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So you must to be any thing to purpose, but     
that will always be of
use in <font>England</font> ; There if you Excel, you'll gain an Estate,      
Reputation, and
the Comfort of being Useful; and a Satisfaction arising from all     
these, will go
beyond the Empty, Ridiculous Pride of the most Towring Pedant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> You might inspire me! --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold -- Have a Care -- I am afraid you're       
Infected.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> On my Soul, Madam, I'm Sound and Wholesome, and --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With Poetry, I mean, that word seems to be a    
Symptom. Have
you not lost time enough with <font>Latin</font> Fustian?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you not sensible of the Power of Numbers, Noble     
Expression,
and well imag'd Truth. I heard you praise <font>Milton</font> , <font>Cowley</font> ,  
and <font>Dryden</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I love it, and have been told our Language 
is as proper for it
of all kinds as the most boasted of Old: So I love Musick extreamly, 
but I
would not marry a Fidler.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> To obtain you, Madam, that you might be the Reward of   
my Labour,
I wou'd Study --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Till you made your self very Dull. Take care of 
that, Observe and
Read Mankind and your self; he that Encumbers himself up with other  
Folk's
Stuff, has hardly room for his own. But what Insolence I am upon to  
instruct
a Man of Education?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I wish some body with their well turn'd Thoughts had    
Instructed my
Parents, who were Ambitious to make me a Scholar, and knew not what  
it
was, or what good for. But Madam, since you are gone so far as to    
lay things
<pagebreak id="21" />
before me in a light, I am infinitely pleas'd with, and what I knew  
not before;
For Heavens sake continue, pray tell me what you'd advise me to?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You see I've had a fair Field of Ridicule, had  
you been full of your
self; but since you are so good Natur'd as to accept of a             
<font>Missionaire</font> in
Petticoats of 21 (for Sir, I'll as frankly own my Standing, as you   
your Degree.)
I'll advise you the best I can, with what I can recollect from       
excellent Men and
Women; for I have, thank God, Convers'd with much better and Wiser   
than
my self. First, Sir, as I am a Christian, I must enforce the Virtues 
that belong
to Christianity, among the rest Humility; You have had a Hint how    
little able
you are to depend upon and Advance your self. Despise no man for     
want of 
Quickness of Parts, Reparty, or any thing of the Fashionable         
Waggery of the
Place you are bred in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What if my Genius soar above another's, Must the  
dull Animal have
the Preference?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say that's no Consequence; but have a Care    
while you are making
Verses and quaint Epigrams, he does not grow up to be a Man of Note, 
and
use, while you make Epigrams and Verses still.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Next have a care of <font>Envy</font> joyn'd with        
<font>Haughtiness</font> , Confine not
Perfection to one Sett of Men, or their Particular way of Education; 
it's as
absurd and ill-natur'd as the <font>Papists</font> with the Pale of their     
Church. You see how
useless the best of your boasted Gawdy Toppings are.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How must I live in the World?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By living in the World, and like one of it; and 
as it's presum'd you
are soberly bred. Be so, let not the Nauseous Porterly Trick of      
Smoaking
overrun you; your Noble Places are Accus'd of having it learnt there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think it for my Health, I cannot leave it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ridiculous, Consult an Ingenious and unbyass'd  
Phys. He'll convince
you to the Contrary; and if for <font>Physick</font> take it as a Vomit       
should be taken in its
proper time <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: tiime</comment> and place. Endeavour to Converse  
and be acquainted with Men of
Business, among them you'll find Conversation may be maintained,     
without the
<font>Bottle</font> and <font>Glass</font> being the Essential part of the Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> A chearful Glass with Moderation --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Is an Excuse for frequent and nauseous       
<font>Bibbing</font> . Must an Man of
Letters and Ingenuity be like a dry Pump, nothing to be got out of   
him till you
pour Liquor into him. Were I one of you, I'd Scorn the briskness of  
my Wit
and Mirth should be owing to any thing, but the Liveliness of my own
Imagination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt, some Dull, Unconversable Fellows introduced   
the Custom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, may be our Neighbours, who have left it,   
and we have kept and
improved it. Why should a Man of Quality and Business, think going   
to a
Tavern a Scandal; and you that think your self as Virtuous and more  
Learned,
practise it? They seem to leave it to the Mobb of a higher Rank, I   
would
Scorn to be reckoned one of the Number.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Open-hearted Friendship, and Hospitable Entertainment,  
were the first
Occasion of this Good Fellowship; and I'm ashamed when I reflect how 
it's
kept up by Clowns, or better Born People as Boorish. Madam, you are  
in the
right, and even the beginnings of it should be carefully avoided.
<pagebreak id="22" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To parallel in our own Sex, that Gayety and     
Liberty of
Conversation, the <font>French</font> call Coquettry, has nothing really      
Criminal in it at first, tho'
it Intrenches upon Maiden Decency, (at least so it seems to us) but  
when
continued, it often leads to Crimes, but certainly to Scandal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, may I beg to know who I am Oblig'd to for  
this Instructing
and Delightful Conversation?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I am as willing to let you and all the     
World know who I am, as
you can be to know. My Father Coll. <font>Topping</font> , had a Handsome     
Gentleman's
Estate, which he Ruined with his Loyalty in the Civil Wars, in which 
he was a
Considerable Officer; the Remains of which maintains my Brother in   
an Idle
Scholar's Life. My Mother died, and left my Sister and I very young. A
Noble Lady bestowed good Education on us, and took us home to her;   
whence
my Sister married to an Honest, Industrious Citizen; They live       
Lovingly,
and God has bless'd them with a Competent Estate, still Encreasing.  
She it was
brought me to the Coach, from a pretty little Seat they have         
Purchas'd. I am
in the same Noble Family stil, Respected as I'd wish; and am, thank  
God,
Secur'd hereafter from the Injuries of the World, and Want in a      
Moderate,
Humble, Single Life, by a bountiful settled Annuity. If ever I       
change my
Condition, it must be to a Man of some Wealth, and I hope good       
Humour,
else my small Maintenance will not Support us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, May I hope for the Continuance of your           
Friendship (I dare
name no more, till I am Worthy of more) and the Favour of an Answer, 
if I
should beg your Advice in order to Improvement, when Opportunity     
offers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my Heart, and the Assistance of any of 
my Acquaintance,
to Serve you. But Sir, the same Question I must ask?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>C. C.</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Father was younger Brother to Sir <font>Humphrey         
Classick</font> , and by my
Mother, who liv'd but Six Years, had my Elder Brother and my self.   
He spent
his Days in Drinking and Hunting; but however he rather Encreas'd    
than
Diminished his Estate of 250 <font>l.</font> a Year. He died six Years since, 
and left my
Brother and me an Annuity out of it of 40 <font>l.</font> and a good Study of 
Books of
my Grandfather's. My Brother has taken to Grazing, and is very       
Successful;
and they that know his Concerns better than I, say he'll raise a     
Great Estate;
he is Unmarried, Moross and Close-fisted to all the World but my     
self. Indeed
I never disobliged him, and we always Lov'd. He generally encreases  
my
Annuity to 60 <font>l.</font> His Quarrel to me is like your Reflections,     
<font>for Book-Idleness</font> , as
he calls it. I am of no Foundation, and therefore must the sooner    
get out into
the World, and my Brother says he will Assist me; but Patrons I know 
none,
should I take Orders.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By no means, Enter not into that Sacred         
Function without a Call
in all Sences.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. C.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Madam, your Soul (that has kindled me) can     
enliven me to be
