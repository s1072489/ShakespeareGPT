</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you acquainted with   
her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Mrs. <font>St. John</font> came to me to know whether 
I took Boarders? I said, I had taken some, but 
would take no more, unless it were the same Ladies again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J. H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was it came to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nightingale,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Mrs. <font>St. John</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Nightingale</font> speak out that my Lord   
may hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mrs. <font>Busby</font> lodge with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nightingale,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, we were very intimate before, 
and since it pleased God to take away
her Husband, I was pleased with her, and very willing to take her    
into my House. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Acquaint his Lordship how Mrs. <font>St. John</font>   
came to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nightingale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, as near as I can. She came   
to me and ask'd me, If I took Boarders? 
I told her No, I would take none except it were those Ladies I had   
before, She told me she had an 
Acquaintance that was a Widow Lady that came out of <font>Wiltshire</font> ,  
about a Suit of Law, and 
would be in a very sober Family near a Church; but however I deny'd  
her Lodgings, and did expect to 
hear no more of her; but about three Weeks or a Month after she came 
to me again, and asked me 
whether I had altered my Resolution?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nightingale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mrs. <font>St. John</font> said, that the  
Lady was come to Town on the <font>Saturday</font> 
Night before, very much Indisposed in her Journey. I asked her       
whether she knew this <font>Baynton</font> or 
no. Mrs. <font>St. John</font> said Yes, she was very Intimate in the Family, 
and she said a great deal more of 
her, which I cannot remember. She said also, that she would have     
Boarded her her self, and would 
have been glad of her Company if she had had Conveniences for her.   
Then she asked me, whether 
she should come her self and give her own Character? We thought no   
harm, she being a Woman, 
and not a Man. She further said, that Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> had been a    
Maid whom I knew, and she 
believed she would take her. I enquired of another who lived in the  
<font>Mews</font> , if he knew Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> ,
he said Yes, and that she came of a good Family. At length she came  
and made a very modest 
Appearance in her Behaviour and Garb. She said to me, that I was     
very curious in taking Boarders, 
and for that she liked me the better. I consented she should come.   
She asked me what I would have 
a Week? I told her twelve Shillings for her self and ten Shillings   
for her Maid. She concluded to 
come on the <font>Wednesday</font> following, which she did with her Maid, a  
modest Girl and a Neighbour,  
which gave me the more Encouragement. She carried her self very well 
till <font>Michaelmas-day</font> <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS IN SOURCE TEXT FOR day</comment> at 
Night, when we heard of her New Brother; she seem'd Elevated at the  
News, and fell into 
Convulsion Fits, which I believed were real Fits. She said she had a 
dear Brother, a good Christian, and he would 
come on the Morrow; when he came he brought two Gentlewomen with     
him, very Modest, which I 
never saw before, nor since. Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> made a Pot of Coffee,  
and sent for a Bottle of Wine, and 
she told her Brother before me, what good Lodgings she had, and said 
she wished he would come and 
<pagebreak id="4" />
Lodge near them, for she knew he had but a puney Stomach, and        
believed he would like her Victuals; 
he said it was not convenient for him because his Business called    
him every Day to the Change; she 
said also there was a Bowling Green near them, where he might divert 
himself, but all would not 
do. She asked me what I would have a Meal if her Brother should come 
at any time. I said, when 
I had other Ladies, if any of their Friends came I had twelve Pence  
a Meal of them. On <font>Friday</font> he 
came. I went to Church, and left them together at Cribbage, as I     
found them at my return.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Day of the Week was this?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Friday</font> before the Sacrament: Mrs. <font>Baynton</font>
said to Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> , before Mrs. <font>Busby</font> , you have an       
extraordinary hand at making Punch, so they 
agreed to make a Bowl the <font>Mundy</font> following; but Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font>  
hardly drank any, she not liking 
any strong Liquors. After this, she told me, her Brother was very    
ill of his Journey, being lately 
come out of the Country, tho' I don't understand he was in't. The    
<font>Munday</font> before <font>Michaelmas</font> Day 
we were at Dinner with two more than our Family, when Mrs.           
<font>Baynton</font> said, she had an Interest in a 
<font>Norway</font> Ship, and invited us all Aboard; but he, <font> <foreign>viz.</foreign> </font>   
Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> , did not come to our House till 
four Days after; but on <font>Friday</font> we concluded to go on             
<font>Saturday</font> ; there were Eight of us in Company in all, 
Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> , Mrs. <font>Busby</font> , I and my Daughter. and Mr.       
<font>Ball</font> another Lodger, belonging to the Exchequer; 
we went, and had much Discourse; after having drank a Glass of Wine  
the Cloth was laid, and the 
Master offered a Bowl of Punch; says Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> , <font>Ladies, I  
would please you all, and leave you all to 
your Liberties to drink what you please</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J. H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this Person Mrs. <font>Bayntons</font> Brother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is he that went for her Brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J. H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereabouts is your House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nightingale,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Near <font>Tuttle-fields</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> came to you under    
the Character of a Country Lady on a Law
Suit; do you understand that she was so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Nightingale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, she said she came from the    
<font>Bath</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You misapprehend the Question, Do you         
understand that her pretence was true or not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I enquired of several Persons who acquainted me  
that the <font>Bayntons</font> lived in <font>Wiltshire</font> ; but it 
was not long before we began to suspect her, for there seemed to be  
an extraordinary Love between 
her and <font>Swendsen</font> , more than is usual between Brother and        
Sister. I said, Madam, I wonder you don't 
marry your Brother. She said, she thought that 'twas not lawful. I   
said there was such a thing done 
in <font>Westminster</font> , of a Mans marrying two Sisters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray call to mind what time it was that you   
first gave notice to her that she should not 
continue in your Lodgings. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I first mistrusted  
her, I gave notice of it in my Family; but we 
being all Women, and fearful of her, thought not fit to give her     
warning till her Month was up; but 
before that, she came to me, and told me, and said, Mrs.             
<font>Nightingale</font> , I have received a Letter from 
my Sister <font>Baynton</font> in the Country, which informs me, that the     
Trustees will agree, and so I design to 
return when my Month is up, for this Town is very chargeable. Very   
well said I, for I expect some 
Ladies very shortly. I went down to my Family and exprest my Joy to  
them, and said, I was very 
glad Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> had prevented me, for if she had not given me  
warning, I would have given her 
Warning, for I resolved she should not stay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Nightingale</font> , it seems you had       
notice of Mrs. <font>Bayntons</font> ill Carriages; Did you take any 
notice of it to her self? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not, but I gave 
the Maid notice as soon as I suspected any 
thing. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know whether the Maid had told any 
thing to her or not? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The 
Maid said to her, Madam, Don't you see a strangeness in the Family?  
Yes, said she, I can see and 
bear a great deal, but when I am rouzed I'll be like a Lion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was this before Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> was 
taken away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't prefix the time, but it was before she   
gave me warning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J. H.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she gone from your House before this    
thing happen'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, she told me on <font>Wednesday</font> that   
her time was out; but said, there is a Fellow 
in Town that I fear will cheat me, and I am taking out a Statute of  
Bankrupcy against him, which I 
think will cause me to stay in Town a Week longer; she also told me, 
she had taken a place in the 
Coach to go on <font>Thursday</font> , but must lose her Earnest, for this    
Business would detain her a 
Week longer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Raymond.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever observe they were together in  
private?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Night.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, we never had any suspition of Mr.   
<font>Swendsen</font> , but of the Woman; for she could 
put on all manner of Disguises.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs.</font> Busby <font>being called she is Sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Busby</font> , pray do you know Mrs.        
<font>Rawlins</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you first acquainted with her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Brother <font>Busby</font> was one of her Guardians,   
and put her under the Care of my Husband, 
while he was living, which was four Years ago this <font>Christmas</font> .   
She came to us by the consent of her 
Guardian.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At what place did you Lodg?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We lived in <font>Stretton-Grounds</font> , but since 
my Husband died, which is three Years last <font>July</font> ,
I left House-keeping, and then we went and lodg'd at Mrs.            
<font>Nightingale's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you continued at Mrs.           
<font>Nightingales</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have continued there ever since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do, she lodg'd at Mrs. <font>Nightingales</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any body who used to come to her    
there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None except a <font>Change</font> Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, The first of his coming to Mrs.             
<font>Nightingales</font> was the Day after <font>Michaelmas</font> Day. Mrs. 
<font>Baynton</font> said, that she had a Brother that was to come to Town,   
which he did the Day after, with two 
Gentlewomen, which I never saw, either before or since; but Mr.      
<font>Swendsen</font> after this came several times 
to her as her Brother, her Sisters Husband, and she desired that he  
might Dine with her sometimes; 
for which she agreed with Mrs. <font>Nightingale</font> at 12 <font>d.</font> <font>per</font>  
Meal.
<pagebreak id="5" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this Mrs <font>Rawlins</font> at any time in private 
with <font>Swendsen</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never that I know of in all my Life, we were     
always in Company together when 
he Dined there, and the times that he Dined there, we computed to be 
9 or 10, he was there 
sometimes when we were not at home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How did Mrs <font>Baynton</font> behave her self when she 
was at Mrs <font>Nightingales</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We thought very well of her, till at last we     
discerned too much freedom between Mr. 
<font>Swendsen</font> and her self, we suspected her Vertue, and thought she  
would Drink, and were informed 
she would Swear, she said she must stay in Town about a month or 6   
weeks about a Suit of Law,
her Maid told her of the strangeness of the Family, she said they    
had best be Civil, or else she 
would stay and plague them. She told <font>Mrs Nightingale</font> at length   
the Town was chargeable, and 
her Business done, and that she would return into the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. G.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know concerning <font>Mrs Rawlins</font>      
being taken away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs <font>Baynton</font> knowing it was our custom to 
go to <font>Oxenden Chappel</font> , every <font>Friday</font> 
morning, she came and told us she had occasion to go to <font>Golden     
Square</font> , and that being in the 
way, she invited us to go with her in the Coach, and she would set   
us down at or near the 
Chappel. When we came to <font>Dartmouth street</font> , somebody bid the     
Coach man stop, I expected she 
should set us down as she promised, on that side where I sat there   
were old Buildings and as I was 
looking out, I heard Mrs <font>Baynton</font> cry out to the Coach man drive  
on, and all of a sudden I saw a 
man in the Coach, which was <font>Hartwel</font> the Bayliff, Mrs <font>Rawlins</font> 
and I were in a very great fright 
knowing nothing: I said for God's sake let's come out, we are not    
concerned, <font>Hartwel</font> said we 
were the persons that he came for, I begg'd of him to let us come    
out, <font>Hartwel</font> had his Arms
about Mrs <font>Rawlins's</font> side, and said, 'tis this Lady and you that  
I am concerned about. I ask'd him 
what it was, said he, let you and I have two or three words          
together, and all will be well 
enough. I said, you don't think I will say any thing to you, unless  
I have my Friends by me, Mrs
<font>Baynton</font> in the Coach, said no Madam be sure                      
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: besure</comment> you don't. I could    
not tell what he would do with 
us, at length he carried us all to the Star and Garter Tavern in     
<font>Drury Lane</font> , I press'd him to let 
us go to <font>Fleetstreet</font> , for I had Friends there. <font>Hartwel</font> was  
very angry, and would hear nothing of 
it, when we came to <font>Drury Lane</font> , Mrs <font>Baynton</font> wou'd have had  
us put on our Masks. I said I had 
done nothing amiss, and I wou'd not; when we were in the Room at the 
Tavern, Mrs <font>Baynton</font> 
hastn'd out of the Room as fast as she cou'd pretending to go for my 
Friends, Mrs <font>Rawlins</font> and I 
were in a great consternation, wondring what they would do with us,  
I took hold of her Arm 
and told her I would live and dye with her. The Bayliffs came in and 
said she was their Prisoner,
and took her by violence from me, they told me she must go with      
them, for they said she was 
Arrested by a Writ out of one Court, and I by one out of another,    
when she was going I put my 
Head out of the Window, and cry'd Murder, Murder several times, when 
I pull'd in my Head
again, <font>Spurr</font> said what have you got by your Bawling, and said    
they were better known there then 
I, they brought a Man to me who said he had Orders to keep me, and   
that he had only a Crown 
for his pains, but he would not suffer me to send for any body. The  
Gentlewoman of the House 
came up, and said I had done a diskindness to her House by crying    
out Murder, she said to me 
look and see whether your Name be spelt right, for it may be a false 
Arrest, <font>&amp;c.</font> <font>Wakeman</font> that 
went away with Mrs <font>Rawlins</font> came back again, and said the young   
Woman was well, and that he 
left her eating Fowl and Bacon, I said I wish she was well. The      
Gentlewoman of the House 
bid the Bayliff shew me the Writ, he said he cou'd not read well,    
but there was the name of 
<font>Sabina Busby</font> at the Suit of one <font>Jones</font> , but when he heard my 
complaints a considerable while, he 
said he would go to my Friends, and would go as cheap as a Porter    
and as soon. I sent him to 
Mr <font>Thornton</font> and Mr <font>Nash</font> , he pretended to go but return'd no 
more till night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You said you cry'd out Murther, how did Mrs   
<font>Rawlins</font> behave her self then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was her great fright and crying that made  
me endeavour her rescue, when we 
said we wou'd dye together, then it was when they forc'd her from    
me, the surprize was so great 
that made me cry out after that manner that I did, upon which some   
Neighbours came in, but 
they told them it was an Arrest, and therefore they wou'd not meddle 
in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs <font>Busby</font> , they kept you till night you  
say, did they take or require Bail for you 
before you was discharged.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs <font>Busby.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you Sir, if you please, I did not   
know what I was Arrested for, it might be 
Murder or Treason for ought I knew, there was a little Boy by, said  
Madam I know Mr <font>Unkle</font> ,
your Friend in <font>Newmarket</font> , and I'll go for him, he went, but     
when he return'd again, he said he 
was not at home, which I thought was a lye, there was a poor man a   
Labourer working in the 
Chimney, he gave me a whink, and said Madam I'll go for him; but I   
said to him pray don't leave 
me, I began to be affraid, for I did not know how my life might be   
concern'd. Said the little, 
Boy I'll go any where for you, I sent him for two Gentlemen who      
came, the Bayliffs said they had 
an Action of 200 <font>l</font> against me, the Gentlemen told the Bayliffs   
they were come to bail me. The

familiar carriage to her Brother,

the VVine, and after that

then I came up to the Coach, and <font>Mr Hartwel</font> I suppose gave the   
word of Arrest, and into the 
Coach he went, but I did not go in because there was no room, but    
rid behind it; the Coach 
was order'd to go to the Star and Garter Tavern in <font>Drury-Lane</font> ,  
when we came there we went 
into a back room, and the Gentlewoman that had a Band-box said to

a Coach I cry'd out Murder, then he threatn'd to put me into         
<font>Newgate</font> , he carry'd me to his House, 
and no body came to help me a great while, but <font>Mrs Baynton</font> said  
that as she was going by the 
Door she heard my Name, and came in, in a mighty Fright; she said to 
me Madam I pity you, 
will no body Bail you? she told me I will send to my Brother who     
shall be Bail for you, she sent 
for him, he came into the Room, and he said what is the matter with  
you, I said enough is the 
matter when I am Arrested for 200 <font>l.</font> and owe no man a penny.     
Said he in a Jacose way what 
makes you affrighted at that, I have a good mind to Arrest you my    
self. Then they took me 
thence to the Vine Tavern in <font>Holborn</font> , where I was an hour or    
two before I heard any thing of 
Marrying or any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they do with you all that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs Rawlins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They got a Dinner ready, and after we had  
Dined, she begged of me to have 
her Brother, and said that if I did not marry him, I should be       
ruined, I told her I would do 
nothing without the advice of my Friends. I desired my Friends to be 
sent for, but they would not 
admit it. She looked on my Ring on my Finger, and said let me see    
your Ring from your Finger. 
I said no, you shall not. She said I will force it off. I said I'll  
try that, but she forced it from me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swendsen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Remember you are upon your Oath.              
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs Rawlins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know I am. When she 
took my Ring away, I askt her what she would do with it, she said    
she should go and get a 
Wedding Ring made by it. I told her I would not marry without the    
advice of my Friends. 
Away she went and bought a Ring, and came up again and said to her   
Brother, she had a Ring; 
well said I give me my Ring and do what you will with the other; she 
said if I did not marry her
Brother I should be ruined for ever.
   There was a Minister in the House, whom they said had been there  
about a quarter of an hour but 
I supposed longer, they brought him with the Clerk up Stairs; the    
Parson saying I hear there is 
a couple to be married, he asked no Questions, but told me if I did  
not marry this Gentleman, I 
should be sent to <font>Newgate</font> and ruined for ever.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give an account of what was after buying the Ring.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When they brought the Ring, they said to me will  
you be marryed or no? I answered I 
will not, there are none of my Friends here, and I will not marry    
without the consent of my Friends
they said if I did not I should be ruined for ever, so with many     
Threats and Perswasions, they at 
last prevail'd with me to marry. I was forced to marry him out of    
Fear, not of going to <font>Newgate</font> ,
but of being murdered.

think it was Candle-light.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawlins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They thrust me up Stairs, and order'd to have  
a Bed sheeted. Mrs <font>Baynton</font> said to me 
undress and go to Bed. I said I wou'd not. She said she wou'd pluck  
my Cloaths off my back. I 
said she shou'd not. She told me she wou'd pluck off my Cloaths and  
make me go to Bed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did she do with you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She put  
me to Bed. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she use any violence 
with you? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ans.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such violence that made me go to Bed.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Raw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr <font>Swendson</font> will you ask her any Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swendson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She must be my chiefest Evidence my Lord,     
when the Witnesses come she must be the 
chiefest of them. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will not ask her any        
Questions now, but when the Witnesses are call'd

Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swendsen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord I am very much unprepar'd             
<comment type="compiler">APOSTROPHE VERY FAINT IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> for a Tryal at present.     
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I had but little time for preparation,   
and I am not prepar'd, I desire that I may 
be allow'd Council.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, it cannot be allow'd you, and as for   
the time of your Tryal you were told, 
if you would shew good cause to have it put off yet, the Court would 
have done it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swendson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I hope if I speak any thing that may be  
prejudicial to my Cause, that the Court 
will not take advantage from it.
   The first time I was at Mrs <font>Nightingales</font> , I was desired by   
Mrs <font>Busby</font> and Mrs <font>Baynton</font> to make a 
Bowl of Punch, which I did, and we were very Merry over it, then I   
invited them to go on Board 
a Ship, which they all did, and we in a short time came very well    
acquainted. My Lord, I desire 
my Wife might stand by her self, and none of them near her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is none near her that will hurt her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord I beg she may stand by her self, that I   
may have a fair Tryal, I pray your Lordship 
to grant me this favour. My Lord will you please to grant it?        
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must I grant it only for 
your humour? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis not a humour, my Lord, but of a    
great consequence to me, will your 
Lordship grant me it? I beg it, my Lord, for 'tis the most material  
thing I have to ask, I beg all 
those people may be removed from her, 'tis the greatest and most     
material thing I have to say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm sorry for it? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is so,    
good my Lord grant me that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's no body near her, that concerns you at 
all. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There are those by her that 
will do me no kindness. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then she is ordered to be removed.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord her standing there is enough to       
disorder her. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord she is very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Remove her a little further. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>   
My Lord he does on purpose to fright her.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We went (as I was telling your Lordship)      
aboard a Ship, and they invited me to come 
the Week following to partake of a Treat, accordingly I went, and    
there was one Mr. <font>Pugh</font> , and he 
and I made a Bowl of Punch. Mr. <font>Pugh</font> at that time Courted Mrs.   
<font>Rawlins</font> , and that little time I 
was acquainted with her I discerned she had a Kindness for me, as I  
had for her; I told her I could not 
be easie while she suffred Mr. <font>Pugh</font> to Kiss her; she desired me  
to be easie and it should be 
remedied.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> . Do you remember any such    
thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I do not remember any such thing, or     
that any such Words ever came out of my 
Mouth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you say this Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> , Mrs.  
<font>Swendsen</font> I should say, did not you say, If I would 
not sit by you you would not eat a bit or a crumb; when I sat by you 
and proffered my place to 
another, can you say you were not offended?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I was not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are not you upon your Oath, did not you give  
me some Encouragement?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know how I could shew it you, I know not 
of any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You ought to speak the truth because his Life  
depends upon it. Did you in the first 
place ever admit of his Courtship in order to Marry you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I don't remember any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever shew any kindness to him upon any 
such account?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I don't know I shew'd him any more kindness    
than all the rest of the Family shewed 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you ever in his Company alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To give me more Ease and Satisfaction after   
Dinner we had our Bowl and Walnuts, Mrs. 
<font>Swendsen</font> pilled the Kernels and gave them to me; she gave them   
faster than I could eat; she heaped 
my Plate with them, every one at the Table took notice of it, and    
she jogged me with her Knee, that I 
should take them, and gave some to Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> , and bid her    
take them and give to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Busby</font> , Were you there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any thing of this kind?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Busby,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will your Lordship <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Lordshiy</comment>  
please to ask her your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> , did you e'er give pilled    
Walnuts to him, or send them to him in particuler?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I do not know that I was more kind   
to him than the rest of the 
Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Every Body took notice of it, and Mr <font>Pugh</font> 
in particular.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you say Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Swendsen,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr <font>Pugh</font> if he were here would    
say the same as I do. He was afraid I should 
get away his Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where is he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Court,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is in the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may have him for a Witness if you will
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> More than this, before he went away she told  
him she did not care for him; this she spoke 
to make me more easie still: This I believe Mr. <font>Pugh</font> can         
Witness, in as much as Madam <font>Busby</font> 
complain'd to her about it, at Mr. <font>Scoreman's</font> the Picture        
Drawers, who is one of my Evidences, I desire 
he may be called.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, let him be called. 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>So he was call'd and came.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hear ye, he calls you to be a Witness, you are 
not to be upon your Oath, but are under 
the highest Obligation to tell the Truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> While I was drawing a Gentlewomans Picture,   
Mrs. <font>Baynton's</font> , there was a Fire, it 
began to be Cold, they fell into Discourse about Mr. <font>Swendsen</font>    
and Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> ; Mrs. <font>Busby</font> was there 
at the same time, they fell into Discourse about Mr. <font>Swendsen</font>    
and the young Lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was she there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At my Lodgings, there were Mrs. <font>Busby</font> ,   
the young Lady, and Mrs. 
<font>Baynton</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose Picture were you drawing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Baynton's</font> , They fell into Discourse 
relating to a matter of Love, 
between Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> and the young Lady. She said the young Lady 
had a Love for Mr. 
<font>Swendsen</font> , more than the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You heard her say so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, but I can say Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> said so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tell us what you heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She should have said so, I did not hear her   
my self, but afterwards upon a 
Discourse she said afterwards, what she had said she would stand to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did she say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know that she said so or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, may I speak it as well as I can, he  
cannot speak <font>English</font> right, 
I'll speak it to him, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no. Did you hear Mrs. <font>Busby</font> say any    
thing? What did she say?
<pagebreak id="10" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In way of Discourse she said so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, in way of Discourse, did she say nothing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard the Lady only say that Word, that     
all she had said she would 
stand to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you hear them talk about?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were playing at Cards, and she took up   
the Tricks of Mr. <font>Swendsen</font> ,
which discovered Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Question is, whether you did hear them     
speak any thing of Love, or 
not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, he would speak better with an        
Interpreter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let an Interpreter be called for.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Country-man are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, he is a <font>Dane</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Interpreter, a Jury-man, was sworn, and beginning to talk   
with <font>Scoreman</font> , and 
he then said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he's none of my Country, he is a <font>Dutch-man</font>       
<comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS IN SOURCE TEXT FOR man</comment> , I don't understand 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He speaks <font>English</font> well enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, but he knows not where he begins,  
he would say what Mrs 
<font>Busby</font> and Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> were speaking, but knows not how to   
utter himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He cannot say any thing for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scoreman,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard but a few Words, and cannot say much  
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must have a better Witness, or you are in  
a dangerous 
Condition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr <font>Pugh</font> complained to Madam      
<font>Busby</font> , that she slighted him 
very much.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, for Love of you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, I could tell you of divers      
things that pass between Lovers, that 
would be impertinent for me to relate to wise Men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us hear some of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When we were by our selves, she kissed me,    
and squeezed me by the Hand, 
when we walked privately in the Garden.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did she kiss you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, My Lord and squeez'd me often.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not think her very coming?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did, and when we talk'd of Marriage,   
she seemed to be very well 
pleased.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> , you hear what he says. Did  
you Squeeze him by the Hand, and 
Kiss him? Is it true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I did no such trick, not I, and as   
for walking in the Garden, I did 
not walk in the Garden alone with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could mention a great many of these little  
things, but if she denies them I 
cannot help it. 
   My Lord, the last time I was at the House we had a Barrel of      
Oysters. I stood 
with my Hands behind me, and as she passed by at any time, she gave  
me Squeezes <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Squezees</comment> by 
the Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to this Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawlings,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I did not do so upon my Oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She says she did not do it upon her Oath.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now for the Matter of Fact; as for the Arrest 
I never knew any thing of it 
directly or indirectly, till I saw her at the Bayliffs House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If she did know any thing of, or was           
consenting to the Arrest, why did 
you force her to the Tavern, and Marry her with a Parson you had     
provided for 
that purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She Married me with as much Freedom as could  
be in a Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to that Mrs.?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will your Lordship please to ask her whether  
I offered any Violence to her 
either by Word or Deed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Rawlins</font> , give an Account how you     
were carried from the Bayliffs

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rawlins,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, when I was at <font>Hartwell's</font> the      
Bayliffs House, Mrs. <font>Baynton</font> 
pretended to come accidentally by, and that she heard my Voice, and  
came in, and said, <font>How 
do you do Mrs.</font> Rawlins? You know how I do, said I. She pretended   
to help me, and 
proposed to go to her Brother to Bail me, and he came, and I was

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, It was at the <font>Vine-Tavern</font> where I  
saw them in <font>Holborn</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it the <font>Mitre</font> , or the <font>Vine</font> ?       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>Vine</font> , I believe, my Lord,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was a Gentleman fetch'd Me and the Clerk  
from the <font>Fleet</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What to do? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said there    
was a Gentleman there to speak with us; When
we came there, the Clerk and I went up one Pair of Stairs and Drank  
a Pint of Wine. Then we were 
led into another Room, I asked him what I was to do. He told me for  
to Marry him to that Young 
Gentlewoman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there a License? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes;    
When I saw the License I read it, and saw it a 
true License; Then I asked the Gentlewoman her Name, to know whether 
it was the same that was in 
the License; and found it was the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it Written in the License that the         
Marriage was to be performed at the <font>Vine-Tavern</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, But a Blank was left.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you take the Queen's Duty?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, But returned their Names 
to the Supervisor; My Lord, when I asked her Name, I also asked her  
whether she was willing to be 
Married. She said she was willing. And another Gentlewoman was with  
her, that said she was her 
Sister: I said to her; Madam if you consent, and your Sister is      
willing, here is a License, for I believe 
there is no danger to Marry you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ask her any other way than in your     
Form, <font>Will you have this Man to your Wedded 
Husband</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask'd her whether she was willing to 
Marry, she said yes, she was willing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did you ask her before you did the Office?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, I did, and she consented to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Counsel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray who was the Person that came to the       
<font>Fleet</font> to you, to carry you to the <font>Tavern</font> , was it the 
Gentleman at the Bar? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No 'twas not him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr <font>Mount.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long was it before you went to him, after  
you went into the Tavern?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Clerk and I went in, and sat the Drinking a  
Pint of Wine, about a quarter of an Hour, 
then we went to the Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think that they should grant Licenses   
to Marry in a Tavern, and out of Canonical Hours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never did it in all my life before, and never 
will do it again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was the Reason, why you were conducted   
into another Room, and not where they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not the Reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sol. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long were you in the Room where they      
were? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Parson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot well tell.
