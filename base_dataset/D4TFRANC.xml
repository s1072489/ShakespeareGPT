   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, We will call our Witnesses. Set  
up Mr. <font>Smith</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then</font> Joseph Smith <font>was sworn</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You was sent, I think, as a Messenger to  
<font>Francia's</font> House: Pray
give an Account of every Thing that passed there. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have the Honour to serve His       
Majesty as one of His
Messengers: I was appointed to attend the Secretaries Office that    
Day, being
my Day of waiting, which was <font>September</font> 19. 1715. I had a Warrant 
delivered to
me against Mr. <font>Francia</font> , but it being late I did not go to       
execute it that Night. The
next Day I went to his House, in <font>Plow-Yard</font> , in                                 
<font>Fetter-Lane</font> ; Mr. <font>Wilcox</font> , another
Messenger, went with me, and went into the House first; he went up   
one Pair
of Stairs and I staid below, and after he had been up a little Time, 
he called me up,
and told me there was the Prisoner: He was then in Bed, and there    
was a Woman
with him he called Wife: We told him, we had a Warrant against him   
for High
Treason, and bad him get up. I asked him if he had any Closet?        
And looking
about, I saw one by the Fire-Place: I opened it, and the first Thing 
I observed
over against the Closet-Door, upon a Shelf, was a Parcel of Letters  
lying open
in <font>Folio</font> ; I saw they were in <font>French</font> , and directed to the   
Prisoner, and upon the
Desk there lay a Paper-Book.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look upon this Book; Is this the Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is the Book; it lay upon the Desk, and I 
looked into it,
and observed this Writing at the one End of it: He said it was his   
Son's Writing,
and then I shut it again. I opened the Desk, and looked over the     
Papers; I
<pagebreak id="12" />
found there several other Papers and Letters folded up: I took them  
out, and laid
them upon the Desk by the others. Then I searcht the other Parts of  
the
Closet, and laid all the Papers by the other Letters. I desired then 
to go up Stairs, and I
did so: And a Person I saw just now in Court, his Son, went with me; 
and I
searched the Rooms and Boxes, and found several other Papers, and    
brought
them down into the Chamber where the Prisoner was, with Mr.          
<font>Wilcox</font> ; I put
up all the Papers together, and said I had taken all Things that I   
thought
necessary, and desired to be going. The Prisoner desired to stay and 
drink some
Coffee; we did so, and then brought him down to a House at           
<font>Westminster</font> . We
carried the Papers to the Office, and delivered them to Mr.          
<font>Horatio Walpole</font> . When
I was in the Chamber with him, he seemed to be under a Concern when  
I put
up the Book; and I asked him what that Book was? He said it was the  
Book of
his Correspondence abroad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this the Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you saw several Letters there, did 
you look into
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw they were directed to <font>Francia</font> :     
There was a Parcel that lay
open in <font>Folio</font> ; and others that lay folded up in the Desk.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What became of the Book and Papers after   
you had them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We went with them and the Prisoner, and       
delivered the Prisoner
into a House at <font>Westminster</font> ; and then went to the Office, and   
staid till Mr.
<font>Walpole</font> came, and then delivered the Book and Papers to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you deliver any Papers to him but what 
were seized there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is become of Mr. <font>Wilcox</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is Dead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was it that the Prisoner said about the 
Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, That is my Copy-Book of my           
Correspondence abroad,
it signifies nothing. I afterwards observed some more Concern than   
ordinary in
him; and he said to me again, the Copy-Book of my Letters signifies  
nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long had you the Book and Letters in your  
Custody?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I received them about Six or Seven a-Clock,   
and I delivered them
the same Day to Mr. <font>Horatio Walpole</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How can you be sure this is the Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I never parted with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not out of your Possession when   
you delivered it into
the Office?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes then it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you set any Mark upon the Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say that which was wrote in it,   
was wrote in it by him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, this is my Copy-Book of my Letters   
to my
Correspondents abroad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But how can you be sure this is the same 
Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I made a Remark of this Writing as he sat     
dressing himself. <comment type="compiler">FOOTNOTE IN SOURCE TEXT EXPLAINS &quot;this Writing&quot; 
TO BE &quot;George Francia's Name in large Church Text, at the End of the
Book&quot;.</comment> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was it that carried the Book and Papers   
to the Office, you or
<font>Wilcox</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know that to be false. How soon did you go  
out of Town after
you had lodged me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a Day or Two.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not go that Moment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No: Not that Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom did you deliver them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To Mr. <font>Horatio Walpole</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you take no more Books?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There were several Books in your House, but I 
don't remember
that I carried any of them away but this. 
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Prisoner own to you, that the    
Letters wrote in that
Book were wrote by him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Smith.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said, that is the Copy-Book of my Letter   
to my
Correspondents abroad.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Horatio Walpole</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, will you give the Court and    
the Jury an Account of this
Book and those Letters; and how, and when they were brought to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember the Warrant for Seising the      
Prisoner was dated the 19th 
of <font>Sept.</font> and that the Day after Mr. <font>Smith</font> and Mr.            
<font>Wilcocks</font> came into my Room,
and deliver'd to me a Copy-book and a Parcel of Letters, which they  
said they
took at <font>Francia's</font> House. I took them and kept them by            
themselves, to be
produc'd when my Lord <font>Townshend</font> should call for them. I          
remember that Night Mr.
<font>Buckley</font> came into my Room, and I desir'd him to sit down and     
look them over with
me, and accordingly, he and I look'd into them. The next Day my Lord
<font>Townshend</font> sent for the Prisoner, and I carry'd in the same Book  
and Letters, and laid
them upon the Table, and particularly the Letters, they were laid    
open, and my
Lord examin'd the Prisoner about them. They were wrote in            
<font>French</font> , and directed
to the Prisoner. My Lord ask'd him whether he knew the Hand of those 
Letters,
and turn'd them all over, and shew'd him the Directions, saying, Are 
these directed
to you? He own'd it. He own'd that he receiv'd them. My Lord ask'd him  
again, Is this your Book? He answer'd, It is; some of the Letters    
are enter'd by
me, and some by my Son.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they all the same Letters that were 
brought to you by
Mr. <font>Smith.</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray look upon this Book; Is this the    
same Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure this is the Book: This is the     
same Book that <font>Smith</font>
deliver'd to me, and said he took it at <font>Francia's</font> House.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then several Letters were shewn to Mr. <font>Walpole</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember all these Letters to be the same 
that I receiv'd from <font>Smith</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After the Prisoner had been examin'd, what 
became of the Letters?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I took them back again. I kept them under   
Lock and Key, till my
Lord <font>Townshend</font> had occasion to use them, which was the same      
Night that my Lord
examin'd the Prisoner; then I took them back, and I constantly kept  
them till I
went to <font>Holland</font> for the <font>Dutch</font> Troops, and then I deliver'd   
them to Mr. <font>Buckley</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you can swear these are the same Letters  
that were deliver'd to you.
By what Mark? You swear very home. What mark did you put upon those
Letters, that you can swear to them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, when they were in your Custody, Are  
you sure they were
never deliver'd out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember one <font>Jones</font> the Gun-maker on 
the other side the
Water, when he was under Examination? Are you sure they were not     
deliver'd
out by Mistake to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know that they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you put any Mark on those Letters?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I put no Mark on them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then how can you know them to be the same?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perus'd them several times. I remember    
the Hand, and Dates,
and Directions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then probably you remember the Number too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I don't remember the Number.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure these are all the Letters that    
were brought to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, there are not all the Letters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will now call Mr. <font>Buckley</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Buckley</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mr. <font>Buckley</font> look upon this Book   
and these Letters, and
acquaint the Court what you know of them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, the Day the Prisoner was seiz'd, I 
came into Mr. <font>Walpole's</font>
Room. He told me he had receiv'd that Book and those Letters that    
were seis'd at
the Prisoner's House, and desir'd me to sit down and read them with  
him. I did so.
Afterwards, when Mr. <font>Walpole</font> went to fetch the <font>Dutch</font> Troops, 
he deliver'd this
Book and these Letters into my Hand. Afterwards my Lord              
<font>Townshend</font> directed me
<pagebreak id="14" />
to look into them, and see which contain'd Passages most Criminal,   
and to extract
such Passages, which I did accordingly out of several of them. I     
will look over
them again, and then I can tell you whether they are the same.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By what Mark?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can tell you by that which is stronger    
than any Mark, I copy'd
Passages out of several of them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he look'd over the Letters one by one.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   I had every one of these Letters from Mr. <font>Walpole</font> , and I     
know it certainly; for
that from every one of these, I extracted some Passages.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you present at any time when the         
Prisoner was examin'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were this Book and these Letters produced to 
him at the time of
his Examination?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was examin'd by my Lord <font>Townshend</font>    
and Mr. Secretary <font>Stanhope</font> ,
and I was call'd in to take his Examination in Writing, accordingly  
I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were the Book and Letters at the time of his 
Examination 
produc'd to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't say that, for I was intent on my    
Paper, writing the
Examination, and looking upon the Prisoner, and hearing what he      
said. When I had
written down what is in my Hand, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (holding out the Original     
Examination.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I read
it over to him distinctly and audibly; and he being ask'd whether he 
was willing
to swear to it, and answering, Yes, I offer'd him his Oath: And I    
offer'd him a
<font>New Testament</font> to swear on. He said he could not swear on that    
Book. But he took
another Book out of his Pocket, and I swore him on that. I ask'd him 
whether this
was true: He said it was. Then he sign'd it; and afterwards my Lord  
<font>Townshend</font>
sign'd it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is the Subscription of his Hand-Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say I took an Oath? On what Book was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed I don't know, I believe it was an   
<font>Hebrew</font> Book; Mr.
<font>Secretary Stanhope</font> look'd upon it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he examin'd at any time after?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Denton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you present then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long were they in your Custody?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From the time that Mr. <font>Walpole</font> went    
abroad, till he came back
again, and then I deliver'd them back to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they in your Custody when Mr. <font>Jones</font>  
was under Examination?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can't tell; but I never did show them to 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they not deliver'd out on that Occasion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they were not deliver'd out by me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you read the Examination to him. Did  
not he desire to
read it himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he not refused to read it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, upon my Soul.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you with the <font>Prisoner</font> in <font>Newgate</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was with him at his own Desire;          
otherwise I had not gone to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember the Days?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How often was you with him there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Twice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were there any Offers made by you to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire you would explain yourself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you make him any Offers, that upon  
his signing any
Paper, he should have his Liberty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not mention to him his giving   
Evidence against any
other Person?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, upon my Soul.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These Questions ought not to be ask'd. It 
is an Iniquity to
tamper with any Man; and therefore such Questions ought not to be    
put. If you
have any Witnesses, you may examine them.
<pagebreak id="15" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then we will examine to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that the Book I swore upon? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (shewing 
a Book he had in his Hand.) </font> </nonSpeech>
    <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know indeed; it was such a sort   
of Book.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't take that to be material, if it   
were the <font>Alchoran</font> . He had
it in his Pocket. But it is not his Oath, but his Confession that is 
material.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech>Taking the Book into his Hands.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I    
understand a little <font>Hebrew</font> .
This is a Book to pray by, not swear by. It is a Collection of some  
<font>Jewish</font>
Prayers and Rituals; I believe, taken out of <font>Maimonides</font> . You    
had best send it the
Learned <font>Monfalcon</font> in <font>Paris</font> , he is compiling some critical   
Observation upon the
<font>Eastern</font> Languages.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you put any Mark on any of those Letters?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did on some of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where are the Extracts you made out of   
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have some of them here, </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (holding    
out some Papers.) </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you do with the Letters, after  
you had made those
Extracts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He tells you that he kept them till Mr. 
<font>Walpole</font> came back again,
and then deliver'd them to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is my Name on some of them. The two    
initial Letters of my
Name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that Mark made upon them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't justly remember.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That might be done yesterday, or since they   
were deliver'd out of his
Custody.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did it while they were in my Possession,  
and before I deliver'd them
back again to Mr. <font>Walpole</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lord <font>Townshend</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must desire your Lordship to inform   
the Court, what your
Lordship knows in relation to the Prisoner at the Bar, as to the      
issuing out the
Warrant against him, and what happen'd afterwards.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, having receiv'd Information     
that there was a
Treasonable Correspondence carry'd on between the late Duke of       
<font>Ormond</font> , Duke 
<font>D'Aumont</font> , <font>Coulange</font> and Mr. <font>Harvey</font> , in which the        
Prisoner was concern'd, and was the
Channel in which the Correspondence was convey'd; and that the       
Pretence of it
was a Law-Suit, but that the Design of it was in Favour of the       
Pretender; and
that when they talk'd of the Party, the Pretender was meant; and     
that they
expected him to be soon here. Having reason to rely on this          
Information, I drew a
Warrant to seise the Prisoner and his Papers. I had indeed before    
sent an Order to stop
all Letters that came from <font>France</font> , directed to <font>Francia</font> , by 
which I receiv'd a
Confirmation of the Intelligence which had been before given me.     
Upon the issuing
out the Warrant, the Prisoner was seis'd, and his Letters were       
brought to <font>Mr. Walpole</font> .
   The next Day I sent for the Prisoner to be examin'd, and order'd  
<font>Mr. Walpole</font> to
bring me the Papers, and sent for the Prisoner in. The Letters that  
<font>Mr. Walpole</font>
brought in, were laid open upon the Table, and the Book lay by them. 
I ask'd
him whether he knew the Hand, and whether those Letters were not for 
him? He
own'd the Letters, but said he could not help what was in those      
Letters, and that
what others wrote to him, could not make him guilty. As for what I   
have wrote
(said he) I appeal to my Book. That is my Book, I appeal to that for 
my
Innocency. He did not appear obstinate, and I remanded him; and at   
night I sent for
him again, and Mr. Secretary <font>Stanhope</font> was with me; I had in that 
time look'd
into more of the Letters, I saw several initial Letters of Peoples   
Names, I ask'd
him the Meaning of them; and he gave me the Account contain'd in this 
Examination. <comment type="compiler">A NOTE IN THE MARGIN: Referring to the Original       
Examination.</comment> He seem'd in a Disposition to tell me all he knew; he 
gave me an Account 
how this Correspondence began, and was carry'd on; and then he came  
to explain
the initial Letters that were in those Letters that were taken upon  
him, and in
several other Letters that I had intercepted. I remanded him again   
that Night,
having taken this Examination in my Hand.
   A second Examination was taken upon Mr. <font>Harvey's</font> Letter:      
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (which 
Examination and the Letter thereto annex'd was shewn to his          
Lordship.) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
   This is the very Letter on which I examin'd him; he own'd to me   
how he
came to stop the Letter, and not to forward it, and explain'd all    
those Figures
to me very distinctly. He protested that he knew no more, and made   
solemn
Protestations that he had said all he knew, and I was almost         
convinc'd he had; but in
<pagebreak id="16" />
the Consequence, I had reason to think he had not. But these two     
Examinations
were taken before me, one I sign'd alone, and the other Mr.          
Secretary <font>Stanhope</font>
sign'd with me. As to the First, I believe Mr. Secretary             
<font>Stanhope</font> was gone out of
the Room before it was sign'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to ask your Lordship whether    
all the Letters that were
brought by Mr. <font>Walpole</font> , were laid upon the Table at the time of 
the Prisoner's
Examination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All that Mr. <font>Walpole</font> brought me were  
laid there, and I saw him
take them back again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to ask your Lordship whether you      
heard that Declaration
read over to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare say I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he not endeavour to excuse himself from    
signing it, till he had
read it himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember that, I don't know that  
he made any Difficulty
of signing it; but I am sure it could not be because he was refus'd  
to read it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not there any Reluctancy in me to sign it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you mean? Have not I answer'd     
that already?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you offer me some Money to sign it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope you can't say a thing of so much   
Infamy. After he had
been examin'd, he complain'd to me of the Misery he was reduc'd to,  
that his Wife
and Family must starve, and represented himself as if he were at     
loss for a Supper:
I told him he had nothing to hope for, or any room to expect any     
Favour, but by
making a clear Confession. He went on begging, and said that his     
Wife was starving;
I do not certainly know whether it was the very Night that he sign'd 
his Confession
or not; but I am sure it was not for that, but in pure Alms, and     
because he begg'd
so hard, I put my Hand in my Pocket, and gave him three, four, or    
five Guineas,
I know not which, in Charity; and it was what I never could refuse   
any Man that
apply'd to me in that manner, and begg'd so hard. He said his        
Brother would not
look upon him, because he was taken up for High Treason, and he      
desir'd me to
give him something in Charity, which I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to ask you whether you ever bestow'd 
on any body else the like
Charity? Pray my Lord, name the Man under your Examination, you ever 
gave
five Guineas to before? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (At which there being a Laugh round    
the Court.) </font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must not be laugh'd out of my Life, you did 
not answer me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Ch. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Propose your Question to the Court?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know who he ever gave five        
Guineas to besides me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord says it was out of Charity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And that he never refus'd any body under his  
Examination the Sum of
five Guineas?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He don't say so; he says, he never could  
refuse his Charity to
People that begg'd as you did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had less Need to beg than some others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have but one Question more to trouble your   
Lordship with, which
my Instructions lead me to; and that is, whether at the time when    
this
Examination was sign'd by the Prisoner, he was not told of its being 
for some
particular Purpose, but that it should not be binding to him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did desire that it might not be made   
use of against him; I
told him that depended on his Behaviour, if he was Ingenuous, if he  
dealt
frankly and fairly, and declar'd all the Truth, I would do all in my 
Power that he should
have Mercy; I don't know whether it is proper to give my Reasons why 
I am
convinc'd he did not deal candidly; but on the perusal of the        
Letters, I found he was
not a bare Conveyer of them, or came by Chance to the Knowledge of   
what he
explain'd in them, but that he was wrote to, as one of the Managers: 
On that I
sent to him again, and told him plainly, he must know more of it. He 
stood it
out that he did not, and then I sent him to <font>Newgate</font> : Soon after 
he was
committed, his Wife came, as Mr. <font>Buckley</font> inform'd me, and        
acquainted him that she was
perswaded, if she could see her Husband, that she could prevail with 
him to
discover the whole: On that I gave Directions to put him into the    
Messenger's Hands
again, which was done; about a Morning or two after, one             
<font>Curtis</font> , who was in the
same Messenger's House, brought a Letter to the Office, which he had 
found drop'd
by his Man's Bed-side. It was directed to his Wife, and the Subject  
was to bid
her not afflict herself, for he found better Company in <font>Newgate</font>  
than he expected,
that the better Half of them were in upon the Government Account;    
that he had
<pagebreak id="17" />
said nothing of Mr. <font>Harvey</font> that could hurt him, nor could he;    
that the
Government had nothing against Mr. <font>Harvey</font> , but a general        
Suspicion that he was against
the Government, which three Parts in four of the Nation were; and    
that he
himself laugh'd at any thing the Government could do against him the 
Prisoner:
When I found a Man write in his Stile, I could not but think he had  
not dealt 
ingenuously.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would propose to the Judgment of the   
Court, whether it is
proper to give Evidence of the Substance of a Letter without         
offering the Letter
it self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This comes in Answer to Mr. <font>Ward's</font>  
Question. He ask'd my
Ld. <font>Townshend</font> , whether there was not some Promise that this     
Confession should not
be made use of against the Prisoner? His Lordship gives this         
Account, and 
justifies himself, how he came to make use of it, and gives this as  
the Reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But to give an Account of the Substance  
of a Letter without
producing it, I apprehend, is not according to the Rules of Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Councel for the Prisoner desire    
the Letter to be read, it shall be read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you insist upon the Reading of it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will read it in the proper time you may.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If in the Course of the Evidence the     
Letter is not read. I don't press it.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Horat. Walpole</font> was call'd again, and the Letter was   
shewed to him.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, will you give an Account what    
you know of this Letter,
and how it came to your Hands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Walpole.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Letter <font>Curtis</font> brought to me, and I 
made this Mark on it: <comment type="compiler">A NOTE IN THE MARGIN: Showing a Mark upon    
the Letter.</comment> He
told me it was found in <font>Francia's</font> Chamber near his Bed-side, and 
this is the Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is nothing prov'd yet of its being the   
Prisoner's Hand, its
being found by his Bed-side will not affect him.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Buckley</font> was call'd again, and the Letter was shew'd   
to him.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray look upon this Paper, and tell us    
whose Hand-writing you
take it to be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never did see the Prisoner write but      
once, and that was upon my
being sent to him to take a Confession he seem'd willing to make,    
and then I sat
by him while he was Writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did he write then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About an Hour, and I read it over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you believe this to be his             
Hand-writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I not only saw him write then, but I have   
read a great deal in this
Book, which Mr. <font>Walpole</font> told me, was taken at the Prisoner's     
House; therefore
being used to the Writing in this Book, and to what I saw him write, 
for those
Reasons, and no other, I believe this Paper to be his Writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Denton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are not the Letters of your Name on this     
Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. When Mr. <font>Walpole</font> put into my       
Hands all the Letters, my
Lord bid me single out those that were fit to be extracted, and I    
did mark them
that were extracted, and I always kept them in my Hands, till Mr.    
<font>Walpole</font> return'd,
and then I deliver'd them to him: Those Letters that I extracted, I  
mark'd; some
other Letters that were intercepted by my Lord <font>Townshend</font> , I did 
not mark, because
they came to me at other times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Denton.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you mark that Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you be positive that it is the Prisoner's  
Hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you rely on the Writing in the Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By that, and by what I did see him write,   
from thence it is that
I conclude this to be his Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He attempts to prove his Hand by two     
Inducements, one that
he saw him write, and the other is the Book; therefore let him fix   
on those Parts
of the Book, that he takes to be the Prisoner's Hand, and to be      
like this Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Book is not material; it is enough    
for a Man to say, that he
saw another write for an Hour together, and then that he believes    
this to be his Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If that was the single Foundation, it    
was something; but he
makes another Foundation also.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Just. <font>Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are going out of the way, the        
Question is, Whether this
shall be read? In order to that, the Method is to prove, that the    
Witness is
acquainted with the Prisoner's Hand-writing, and believes this to be 
his Writing. He
tells you he saw him write for an Hour. He gives you a further       
Reason, that it is
<pagebreak id="18" />
like some Letters in the Book. If that were laid out of the Case,    
the other would
be sufficient without it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Man makes two Things the Foundation    
of his Judgment
his Seeing him write, and the Similitude of Hands in the Book; the   
most conclusive
Evidence would be, the Similitude of the Hand in the Book, which     
others may
judge of as well as himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is no Evidence at all; Similitude of 
Hands in no Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am far from thinking it is, or that    
there is as yet any Evidence
at all. Do you believe this to be his Hand, only from your having    
seen him write,
or from what you have observ'd in the Book also?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say that from my having seen him write,   
and my having seen the
Entries in the Book, I believe this to be his Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Just. <font>Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you had never seen the Book, but had 
seen him write for an
Hour; Could you collect from thence that this was his Hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I would not affirm it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then it is with us, and makes it         
necessary to look into the Book.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How come you to apprehend any one Part of  
the Book to be
<font>Francia's</font> Writing more than the other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Eye-sight, and comparing it with this 
Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it from your Knowledge of seeing him    
write?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and this Writing being like this Book.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire this Matter may be consider'd   
how it stands, my Ld.
<font>Townshend</font> is examin'd touching the Confession of the Prisoner,   
and was ask'd whether
there was not hopes of Mercy given him, my Lord said there were,     
upon his
making a frank Discovery; but he tells you the Prisoner was not      
entituled to Mercy,
because he had not made such a Discovery, and then gives an Account  
of this
Letter: I thought the Councel for the Prisoner appeal'd to that      
Letter, and would have
had it produc'd, to check the Evidence given by my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. J. <font>Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since it is gone thus far, I think it      
would be proper to clear this Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know where Mr. <font>Buckley</font> saw me 
write for an Hour together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in the Messenger's House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Just. <font>Tracy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Ld. <font>Townshend</font> was giving an      
Account in Answer to a 
Question propos'd by the Prisoner's Councel, and gave his Reason     
why he did not think
the Prisoner was frank. I did not think so (says he) because of a    
Letter which
was found by his Bed-side. Says Mr. <font>Hungerford</font> , then that       
Letter ought to be produc'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Account is no more than that my   
Lord observ'd so upon
that Letter, there is no great Harm in reading it: But I am still in 
your Judgment,
Whether, when the Contents of a Letter is insisted upon, and         
repeated, and that
upon Memory only, the Letter it self ought not to be produc'd?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then -- <font>Curtis</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look upon that Letter, Whose              
Hand-writing is it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it is Mr. <font>Francia's</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seen him write?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And do you believe it to be his Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you been acquainted with the     
Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> While he was in the Messenger's Hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How often did you see him write?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Several times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in Custody at the same time when he was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Soll. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did you find this Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In his Chamber by his Bed-side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't hear that he gives an Account,    
whether he is so well
acquainted with his Writing, that he can distinguish it from any     
others?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Curtis.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He told me it was a Letter that he had wrote to 
his Wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Letter is in <font>French</font> ; we have a    
Translation of it; we must
desire that the Interpreters who translated it, may be sworn.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Boyer</font> , and Mr. <font>Ozell</font> , were both sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you translate the Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Boyer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did, and afterwards I compar'd it with Mr.  
<font>Ozell</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is that a true Translation of the original   
Letter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Boyer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did make a true Genuine Translation of it,  
allowing for the
difference of Language and Stile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it the best and most exact Translation   
you was able to make?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Boyer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Ozell</font> , Have you compar'd this       
Translation with the Original?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ozell</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and I believe it to be a true Translation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Note.</font> That the Original Letter was deliver'd into the      
Prisoner's Hand, during
the time that the Translation was Reading; and Mr. <font>Flint</font> , who   
was permitted to
stand in the Bar near the Prisoner, assisted him in Comparing the    
Original with the
Translation. The like Method was observ'd, when the Translations of  
the Letters
receiv'd by the Prisoner, were read; and when the Letters wrote by   
him were read
out of the Copy-Book, the Copy-Book was shown to him.</nonSpeech>

<font>Townshend</font> at any other
time, and therefore would take this Opportunity: I think your        
Lordship said, that
the Letters that were stop'd at the <font>Post-Office</font> , were laid on   
the Table with the
other Letters, when the Prisoner was examin'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not say that. The Letters that were 
intercepted, I did first lay
them before the King, and then put them into the same Hands with the 
other Letters.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. Secretary <font>Stanhope</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Secretary <font>Stanhope</font> , we must       
desire you to inform the Jury what
you know about the Examinations of the Prisoner, and the Confession  
he made?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Secret. Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have here two Examinations; one  
sign'd by my Ld.
<font>Townshend</font> , the <font>21st.</font> of <font>Sept.</font> and the other dated the   
<font>22d.</font> of <font>Sept.</font> sign'd by my Ld.
<font>Townshend</font> and myself. <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR 21 OR 22 IN SOURCE        
TEXT.</comment> I was present at both the Examinations: There has been an
Account given of the First, which is perfectly Agreeable to what     
pass'd there, and my
Name is to the Second.
   There is annex'd to this Second a Letter, which we take to be Mr. 
<font>Harvey's</font> : I
remember the Letter; the Hand is particular, and there are Figures   
by way of Cyphers.
I remember very well this Letter. It has been before the Cabinet     
Council. It was
shown to Mr. <font>Harvey</font> at the Council-Table; he did not deny it,    
but shew'd the
utmost Consternation when it was shown to him; and desir'd that he   
might withdraw,
and have the Liberty to speak to one particular Lord. The manner of  
his
Behaviour was such, as to induce the Lords of the Council to be of   
Opinion, that he was
inclin'd to confess what he knew; therefore they thought fit to let  
him withdraw,
and go to the Messenger's House; but his Agonies were such, that he  
stabb'd
himself that Night, or the next Morning.
   I believe at twice we spent about two Hours in the Examination of 
the Prisoner,
and these Examinations were taken from his own Mouth; and I can be   
positive
there is not a Passage in them, that he did not repeat more than     
once or twice. The
reason why my Name is to one, and not to the other, may be, because  
the Room
where he was examin'd was next to the Room where the Council used to 
meet; and
I believe I might be going in and out between the two Rooms, and     
might not be there
when he sign'd it; and therefore I might not think it proper to set  
my Name to what
I did not see sign'd: But I saw him sign that to which my Hand is    
set; and I don't
remember that he had any Reluctancy to sign it. I read the first     
Examination more
than once or twice to him, and did my self examine him to all the    
Particulars of it.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   After the first Night's Examination, it is certain he behav'd     
himself like a Man
not worth a Groat, intimating as if he did not know how to get a     
Supper: He
represented himself in a pitiful Condition, and it was at his going  
out of the Room,
that my Lord put his Hand in his Pocket, and gave him something,     
what it was, I
don't know, but it was after he had sign'd his Examination; for      
after it, there was
a good deal of Conversation pass'd between him and me. I ask'd him   
several
Questions, as to his being in <font>France</font> , and about the Countries   
he came from; and ask'd
him as to several <font>Spanish</font> Letters that were in the Book, and     
other things of that Nature.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he not desire to read over the             
Examinations before he sign'd them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Sec. <font>Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember that he did; but     
they were read over to him,
and he was ask'd to every Particular by myself, some one Particular  
might slip; but
I did examine him, I think, to every Particular, in order to have it 
alter'd, if he
objected to it, and he did not express the least Reluctancy. I saw   
him set his Hand
to one of them; as to the other, I can't say, because the Room was   
next to the
Room where the Council was sitting, and I don't know but that I      
might be there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you remember any thing particular that was  
said to him, that those
Examinations should only be laid before his Majesty, and no other    
use made of 'em?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Secretary <font>Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember any such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If he had desir'd to have read these      
Examinations, would you
have refused it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Secret. Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It never was deny'd to any Man to  
read his Examination
before he sign'd it, where I was present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor you would not have refus'd him, if he 
had desir'd it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Secretary Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, God forbid.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am inform'd that the Prisoner wrote    
some Letters to my Ld.
<font>Townshend</font> , complaining of some other use being made of his      
Examinations, than was design'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sec. Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I receiv'd some Letters from the      
Prisoner, but none that I
thought were of any sort of avail.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he complain of his not being         
suffer'd to read them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Sec. Stanhope.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember it; but I am sure it 
was not so. If he did
complain, it was without any ground.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire a Sight of the Original Letter,      
which <font>Curtis</font>
said I own'd. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Which was shewn him accordingly.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never     
wrote one Word of it; it is forg'd since:
Any body will say it; it is not like my Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before the Examinations are read, I desire   
the Gentlemen of the
Jury would take an Account in Writing of the Initial Letters and     
Figures they will
hear read, and then will observe who are the Persons meant and       
intended by them,
according to the Prisoner's Explanation, when he was examin'd.       
Gentlemen, it is
necessary you should understand, who are the Persons that are        
intended by the Letters
and Numbers. If you take them down, all the Letters will read to the 
Purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Ch. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Gentlemen</font> , They desire you will take 
Notice of the Letters and
Numbers, that are explain'd in this Examination, because you will    
the better
understand the Letters that will be read to you: That is what they   
desire, and it will
be for your Satisfaction.

the Nature of the Correspondence.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am inform'd there are different Hands in     
that Book: Now
whether your Lordship will admit them to read it under a general     
Proof of his
owning it to be his Copy-Book, or whether you will not expect that   
that which is
his Writing should be prov'd, and what is wrote by any other, to be  
wrote by
his direction, or privity; for a small Variance in the Expression,   
may turn a
Man out of his Life.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All that the Witnesses said was. That    
the Prisoner said it was
his Copy-Book. Now whether he is to be affected by every Word in that
Volume, is what we must submit to your Lordship; and whether they    
ought not
to single out which were wrote by him, and which not; for his        
saying that is
his Book, that is, the Volume is his, the Cover is his, and the      
Paper is his, but
it will not imply that he is the Author of all those Letters.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, when they objected to our        
reading the Copy-Book,
they ought to have made all their Objections together; but this      
being in the
Case of Life, I won't stand upon that. 
   It is plain, it ought to be read; for you observe the Letters, of 
which these
are Copies, are suppos'd to be sent to <font>France</font> ; and it is        
impossible to have
them; then what Certainties have we touching these Letters? We have  
the
taking the Book in the Custody of the Prisoner, and if there had     
been no more
then it's being found in his Custody, I apprehend we might have      
been let in to
read 'em. But it goes a great way farther; for several of the        
Witnesses Swear
that he own'd it was his Copy-Book of his Letters.
   Let's consider how this Evidence would have been, if it had been  
given to
every Letter in particular. If we had produc'd one single Copy of a  
Letter,
and he own'd that was a Copy of a Letter wrote by him, will any one  
doubt
but that it might be read? No, the Evidence say that he own'd this   
to be the
Copy-Book of his Letters.

<pagebreak id="45" />
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall leave it here, and submit it to   
your Lordship and the
Jury, upon the Evidence we have offer'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen 
of the Jury, I
am Council for the Prisoner, and what I shall humbly offer to your   
Lordship before
we go into our Evidence, is a single Point, we shall lay before you  
and insist upon;
a particular Circumstance in the Indictment, which is such, that     
considering the
Circumstance of my Client, it is impossible as the Law stands, that  
he should be
guilty in such manner as is charged in the Indictment.
   The Prisoner happens to be an Alien born, he was born at          
<font>Bordeaux</font> in <font>France</font> ;
he came from thence into <font>England</font> , and never was Naturaliz'd. He 
owes therefore
no natural Allegiance, nor can be guilty of any Treason against the  
King as his
natural Leige Lord, as its laid in this Indictment.
   There is a Distinction of a double Allegiance, one that is due    
from a natural
born Subject, and the other that is due from an Alien. The latter    
owes only a
local Obedience with respect to his Protection, whereas the former   
owes it in respect
of his Birth. This is a Distinction well known in <font>Calvin's</font> Case. 
It appears, that
if an Indictment for Treason be against an Alien, it must be charged 
to be against
his Allegiance in general, but not against his natural Allegiance.   
This is taken
notice of in a great many Cases. In the Reports of my Lord           
<font>Hobart</font> , <font>Vaughan</font> , and 
<font>Keyling</font> , there are several Cases which show this Distinction.
   In my Lord Chief Justice <font>Holts</font> time, in the Trial of          
<font>Cranborn</font> , and <font>Lowick</font> ,
<font>April</font> 22. 1696. an Exception was taken to the Indictment; that   
it was not said
<font> <foreign>Contra Naturalem Ligeantiam</foreign> </font> ; and in that Case,            
<font>Calvin's</font> Case was agreed to be Law.
<pagebreak id="46" />
It was held, that in case of an Alien, he ow'd only a general        
Allegiance, and it was
agreed, that in case of an Alien, it must not be <font> <foreign>Contra         
naturalem ligeantiam</foreign> </font> ; and my
Lord Cheif Justice <font>Holt</font> says, if it were so, it would be ill.    
And it may be given
in Evidence, that he is an Alien, in order to acquit him of a Crime, 
charg'd to be
against his natural Allegiance; there is none such due.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, The Objection is founded on a   
Fact. If the Fact is
admitted, we will argue upon it; if not, we will call some Witnesses

to School
with him, and some that knew him there a Child.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Jury should be satisfied with this  
Evidence, it will not
acquit the Defendant, the Opinion in <font>Cranborn's</font> Case being, that 
the Word
<font>Naturalem</font> was not necessary to be in the Indictment; and adding  
an immaterial Word
will not therefore make the Indictment bad. If this does not satisfy 
the
Defendant's Council, I shall insist that this Point be found         
specially.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you insist that you have given a     
sufficient Evidence to satisfy
the Jury, and indeed it is a strong Evidence, Mr. <font>Attorney</font> says, 
if the Evidence
is to the Satisfaction of the Jury, he is willing to find it         
specially. Therefore are
you willing to leave it to the Jury on that single Issue?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is giving up all the rest. I would  
a little enforce and
apply this Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe, if Mr. <font>Attorney General</font>  
desires it to be found
specially, it was never known to be denied.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire it may be found specially.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will be bold to say, this Objection is 
in all the Authorities
which we have in the Law touching this Matter, held good: A Man who  
is not a
natural born Subject cannot owe a natural Allegiance: And it is very 
hard, that
without offering any Reason, to raise a Doubt, but upon bare asking  
to have a
Matter found specially, it must be so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you have a mind to it we will debate it 
with you now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my Heart, I am ready to speak   
to it now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If we were to expect the Judgment of the 
Court upon it now,
I would debate this Matter now, and I should not doubt but to be     
able to satisfy
the Court that the Indictment is well fram'd against the Prisoner,   
notwithstanding
he is an Alien born.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would be glad to hear one Authority to 
support Sir <font>Joseph's</font>
Opinion.

    </sample>
    <sample id="SAMPLE 4">

<pagebreak id="49" />
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I shall take up but a very      
little of your Time
till we have gone through our Evidence, and then shall apply my self 
to
make some Remarks upon it. But in general, the Accusation contained in
this Indictment is, That this Man has conspir'd to take away the     
Life of the
King; the Overt Acts laid are, That he conspired to levy War, and 
endeavoured to engage Assistance from abroad, and wrote Letters, and 
sent them
to divers Persons beyond Seas for that Purpose.
   Gentlemen of the Jury, I am sure you must observe, that as to a   
direct
Proof of his intending to take away the truly precious Life of the   
King, there
is none, but what is endeavour'd to be inferr'd from these Letters.  
If there
were, I am sure I should not, and, I believe, none of my Profession  
would
have spoke one Word for him. But all that is said arises from        
himself. There
is no Consultation appears, but that this Man consulted with himself 
and his
Compting-House to take away the Life of the King. As to any of those
Letters, there is nothing in them that looks that Way. And as to     
what is
contained in the Letters received from <font>France</font> , they cannot      
affect him. All
that can be inferr'd from them is, that he was privy to what was     
contained
in those Letters: And if that were High-Treason, yet it can only     
amount
to Misprision of Treason in the Prisoner. You who live in this great
Trading City, the most eminent for Trade and Commerce in the World,  
in
which, I believe, you are very much concerned, know that a great     
Part of
the Commerce is carried on by Letters, and all or most of them are   
entred
in Books; you must have a due Apprehension of the Consequences of    
such
a Transaction as this is. To have a Man living in his House in Peace,
under the Protection of the King's Laws, to have his Books and       
Papers taken
from him, and those Books and Papers turn'd against him, to the
Destruction of him and his Family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire you would forbear inveighing  
in this Manner.
This is not a proper Manner of proceeding.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have had an Account that an           
Information was given
to the Secretary of State, of a treasonable Correspondence carried   
on by this
Man, and here is an Harangue complaining that his Person and Papers  
are
seiz'd. You know if there had been an Information given to the meanest
Officer in the Kingdom, he could not have justified himself, without 
doing
the same Thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord. C. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are not to arraign those Proceedings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't doubt but that noble Lord had    
Grounds for what
he did, but what Grounds he had doth not appear: And surely I have a
Right to observe, that all the Evidence that appears against the     
Prisoner,
arises from those Letters and Books that were taken away from him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mr. <font>Hungerford</font> act within the 
Bounds of your
Profession.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. Attorney, I am to be corrected by    
the Court, and
not by you. I owe Duty to my Lords the Judges, and I shall always    
pay it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Tracy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You ought not to reflect on that        
Matter, of seizing the
Papers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not understood. I say all that is   
offer'd against
him is from the Papers found in his Custody.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Prat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If that was all that you had said you    
ought not to have been
interrupted, but I never knew in my Life, but what was done in this  
Case
was ordinarily done in the like Cases, and ought to be done, and you 
ought
not to go on with Invectives to the Jury, complaining that his       
Papers are
seiz'd, and then that those Papers are turn'd against him. When a
Correspondence is carried on by Letters, ought they not to be        
seized, and if they
appear to be treasonable, ought they not to be kept, and made Use of 
against
him. We must not sit here to hear Invectives against Magistrates of  
the
highest Quality, for doing that, which if they had not done, they    
had failed
in their Duty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have not said any Thing to impeach the 
Legality of
what was done. All I said, and do say, is, that the Evidence is from 
the
Papers found in his own Custody.
<pagebreak id="50" />
   You have heard the Letters read, and you observe, That great Part 
of
them is about Dogs and Horses, and a Summ of 130 <font>l.</font> 4 <font>s.</font> and 
about a Suit
that was carrying on in the Court of Chancery. As to the Book, I shall
touch no more upon it now, but I believe we shall be able to offer   
Proof
that there is not any Part of it wrote by himself. How that will     
agree with
the Evidence already given, we must submit. We shall likewise give   
some
Account of some Discourses that have been had with the Man himself.  
And,
I believe, I need not observe to Gentlemen of your Figure and
Circumstances, That the Mr. <font>Harvey</font> , who is represented by the   
King's Council, to
be the first Promoter of, and carried on this treasonable            
Correspondence, is
at Liberty, even without a Trial; and what the Law hath done for him
without a Trial, I hope shall, by your Justice, be done for the      
Prisoner, now
upon his Trial, that is, that he shall be acquitted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Though it is difficult for us to be put to     
explain any of those
Letters, yet we will call some Witnesses to explain one, which       
mentions
Persons of 50 or 60 Thousand Crowns a Year, and shew that it was meant
of one that was concerned in the Revenue in <font>France</font> , and         
suffered by it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Prat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you are going to explain that Letter, 
it will be
necessary to read it again to the Jury.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Which was done accordingly.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will shew it was meant of one <font>George      
Francia</font> , who had
been concern'd in the Revenues in <font>France</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Simon Francia</font> being sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you know <font>George Francia</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he concerned in the Revenue in       
<font>France</font> , and had he
any Loss there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he lost all he had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By what Occasion was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it by his own Management, or         
depending on others?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know, but I know he had an Estate   
and lost it all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We offer this only as a Sample for the rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was this Man worth?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I computed him to be worth Eight or Ten     
Thousand Pounds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doth he answer the Description in the  
Letter of a
Person of Fifty or Sixty Thousand Crowns a Year?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had he any Estate in Land?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, only in Money.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know of any Offers that have been 
made, or
Threats used to the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know of some.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By whom.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By Mr. <font>Buckley</font> . That if he would swear 
against Mr. <font>Harvey</font>
of <font>Comb</font> , he should have a good Reward.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know of any other?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord <font>Townshend</font> told me he had   
given my Brother
five Guineas, and he would give him more if he would swear against
Mr. <font>Harvey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where did he tell you so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Office at the Cockpit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any Thing of two Warrants    
that Mr.
<font>Buckley</font> brought, one for his Releasment, and the other for his
Confinement?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know any Thing of that.
<pagebreak id="51" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came this Discourse between my     
Lord <font>Townshend</font>
and you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was several Times with him at the Office  
about my Brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope it will be proper at this Time  
that my Lord
<font>Townshend</font> and Mr. <font>Buckley</font> , may be ask'd to this Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Prat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose you was present when this past 
between Mr.
<font>Buckley</font> and the Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was between my Lord <font>Townshend</font> and    
me, and Mr. <font>Buckley</font>
and me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Prat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who else was by, besides Mr. <font>Buckley</font>  
and you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Body else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Prat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who was by, when that which you          
mention'd, past
between my Lord <font>Townshend</font> and you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Body else. The first Time I applied to   
my Lord <font>Townshend</font> ,
I think there was another Secretary there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Prat.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But at that Time that you say this Offer 
was made,
was any Body present?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed I don't remember that there was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think you say, the first Time you was with 
my Lord
<font>Townshend</font> , there was the other Secretary there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, there was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was this, in what Room?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Cockpit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is your Relation to the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am his Brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say there was another Secretary by,  
Was it the
other Secretary of State?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not who it was, there was another    
Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said another Secretary of State.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did my Lord <font>Townshend</font> say to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he had given my Brother five        
Guineas, and he would
give him more, if he would swear against Mr. <font>Harvey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say at that Time there was        
another Secretary?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, not at the Time of that Discourse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor there was no Body with you and Mr.   
<font>Buckley</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Lucy White</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you by, or in hearing, when any      
Offers were
made to the Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>White.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Seventh of <font>September</font> I went to see  
the Prisoner in
<font>Newgate</font> . He told me Mr. <font>Buckley</font> was to be there with him,   
and desired me to
conceal my self in the Room, that I might hear what past, and I did  
so.
When Mr. <font>Buckley</font> came he spoke about one <font>Flint</font> ; and         
afterwards Mr.
<font>Buckley</font> ask'd him several Questions about Mr. <font>Harvey</font> . He    
said he knew nothing
but that he was innocent. Mr. <font>Buckley</font> told him he must swear     
right or
wrong for the Government; if he would not, he himself would swear    
High
Treason against the Prisoner; for he had taken Money of my Lord
<font>Townshend</font> , and done nothing for it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Thing of two Warrants    
Mr. <font>Buckley</font>
had at that Time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>White.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did Mr. <font>Buckley</font> see you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>White.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I conceal'd my self under the Feet of the Bed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say this was the Seventh of        
<font>September</font> . What Year?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>White.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the Year 1716.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was he then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>White.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Newgate</font> .
<pagebreak id="52" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Mary Meggison</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know of any Offers that were made 
to the 
Prisoner, and by whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Twenty Eighth of <font>September</font> last  
I was in Mr.
<font>Francia's</font> Room, and Mr. <font>Buckley</font> came in and told him he      
should be tryed
suddenly, and there were a great many Witnesses against him; and he
would swear against him, because, says he, you have cheated my Master
of Five Guineas, and won't swear against Mr. <font>Harvey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in the Room then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I sat upon a little Box at the Bed's Feet,    
and it was so dark
he could not see me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you to <font>Newgate</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been a great many times in <font>Newgate</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You dwell there sometimes, don't you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I never did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you a married Woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is your Husband?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Dealer, but he is not in <font>England</font> now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Room was I in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A little dark Room.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do they call it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lions Den.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Every Body knows that Room is a dark Room,    
that People
can't easily be seen in it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear Mr. <font>Buckley</font> say any     
thing more?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Meggison.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing, but that he would bring my Lord      
<font>Townshend</font> into
Court, on purpose to influence the Jury by his presence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As to these two Witnesses, we have       
several to speak to
their Reputations; but I believe you have no doubt as to that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I dare say no one Person in Court        
believes a Word they say.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Buckley</font> was called again.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know whether you was not with me  
in the Lions Den.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, the Prisoner sent to me by         
<font>Revell</font> the Turnkey,
and desired to speak with me; when I came to him, he spoke to me first
about <font>Flint</font> , and desired he might be released from his strait   
Confinement; 
and then about his own Affairs. He thank'd me for my Humanity in
coming to talk with him, so we parted immediately. I told my Lord    
<font>Townshend</font>
what had past; <font>Flint</font> had the Benefit of it. He had been confined 
close, but
<font>Francia</font> speaking on his behalf, he was released from that        
Confinement; and
that was the Business I went about. The Room is a little dark Room,  
but
if any Body had been at the foot of the Bed, I believe I might have  
seen
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you say those Words?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, it is impossible I should.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not impossible surely?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Buckley.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, impossible, I appeal to my Character:  
I entirely and
utterly deny it. I desire that <font>Revell</font> may be called.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are now in our Evidence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Prisoner calls a Witness that   
has been called
before, and he to make his Evidence entire, appeals to <font>Revell</font> ,  
we ought to call
him now, for it would have been improper before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it be nothing but that he was sent    
for Mr. <font>Buckley</font> ,
there is no great Harm in it. Otherwise we are in the Course of our
Evidence.
<pagebreak id="53" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Revel</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know the Occasion of Mr.        
<font>Buckley's</font> coming
to <font>Francia</font> in <font>Newgate</font> ; Give an Account of what you know of  
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Revell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr. <font>Francia</font> , called to me one     
Day, and I think it
was when I was in the Chappel, and told me, I believe I can do a Piece
of Service to the Government; I believe I can suppress the           
publishing of the
<font>Shift shifted</font> , I am sure I can: Pray let me speak with Mr.      
<font>Buckley</font> . Says I,
if you would have me, I will go to him, and desire him to come. When
would you speak with him? At any time, says he; then I believe the
Morning is the best to meet with him; and the next Morning I went    
to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir. <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you tell him the Occasion of         
<font>Francia's</font> desiring to speak
with him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Revell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was you in the Room with them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Revell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, but afterwards he said to me, I think I     
have done the
Government some Service, you don't hear it come out as it us'd to do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to know whether Mr. <font>Buckley</font> was  
not angry with you
that you did not stand at the Door.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Revell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He order'd me to be about the Door, but there   
came some
Workmen to survey the Chappel, I was obliged to go with them, and he 
came
out and was angry that I was not there; and after that I stood there 
till they
had done, but I did not hear what Discourse past.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lord <font>Townshend</font> stood up.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Lord <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr. <font>Buckley</font> came to me, and 
told me of the
Message he had receiv'd from the Prisoner about the <font>Shift          
Shifted</font> , a 
scandalous Paper that was sent about the Kingdom. He ask'd me if he  
should go:
I told him I thought it was right to go, but I told him he must be   
cautious,
for I did not doubt but that the Prisoner was capable of that        
Villany I now
find he is. He came back to me, and told me what he has now said;    
and I
believe it to be all that past between them, for I have always found 
him
faithful and honest. I thought it was a Service to put a stop to     
that Paper;
and I did give some ease to that Man that is named.
   I am amazed how there can be such Villany as in the Brother. He   
came
to the Office two or three Times with Petitions. I never said any    
thing
more, than that it was not in my Power to do any thing; that he must
deal ingenuously, tell all that he knew, and shew that he would      
speak all 
the Truth; that that was the Way to recommend him to the King's Mercy;
that I could not do any thing without it. And I believe the manner I
treated Mr. <font>Harvey</font> will justifie me, with all that know any      
thing of it,
from the Suspicion of such Intentions against him. All that I did    
was in
regard to the Prisoners wretched Circumstances, and before Mr.       
<font>Stanhope</font> ;
and I never desir'd any thing of him, but to tell the Truth, and the 
whole
Truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You told me I should be hang'd, drawn, and    
quartered; and
your Lordship told me many a time, Damn you, you Dog, now I have got
Mr. <font>Harvey</font> in my Clutches, and you will let him go from me. If   
there
was no particular Animosity against me, why should I be              
distinguish'd, for
none were put in Irons for Treasonable Practices, but me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would not take up your Lordship's      
time, but only to
say, that the Warrant for Irons, and to be kept without Pen, Ink, and
Paper, was after that Letter had been deliver'd to me, the Contents  
of which
will sufficiently justifie the Precautions used in that Warrant. I   
was sorry
to see the ill Use he made of the Liberty that I had before given    
him, and I
did issue that Warrant in that manner. Treasonable Practices were    
then no
more bailable than Treason; and it's no new thing to fetter          
State-Prisoners
under such an Accusation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg leave to ask your Lordship one Question, 
whether you
apprehend that <font>Curtis</font> deserv'd any Credit?
<pagebreak id="54" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can say no more, than that he made     
some Discoveries,
and there was no Prosecution against him. I knew nothing of the Man
before, and I know nothing more of him now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did those Informations appear to be true?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Townshend.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A great part did, by the Confession of   
one of the Persons
he accused.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As to the two Women that were examined   
just now, there
was a Remark made, that their Testimony was extraordinary; I have    
five or
six People to speak to their Reputation, if it sticks with Mr.       
<font>Attorney</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps such as themselves; but        
however call them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Everall</font> was called.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of <font>White</font> or         
<font>Meggison</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know nothing of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know where the Prisoner's Foreign       
Letters used to
be left?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Letter always came to my House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he usually watchful for the coming in of   
his Letters, as if
there was any Thing of Concern in them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they often used to lye some time before he 
call'd for them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long did they use to lye?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes three or four Days.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they kept up close till he called for them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they lay in a publick Room, so that any    
one might see them.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mrs. <font>Everall</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of any Letters directed 
for Mr.
<font>Francia</font> ; where were they left?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They used to be brought to our House, and  
they have lain
two or three Days together on a publick Table before they have been  
fetch'd
away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long ago was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About seven Years ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have any been directed to your House of late?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall now examine some Witnesses to the     
Copy-Book, to
prove that it is not of his Hand-Writing; and I don't doubt but that 
will have
its weight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Chief Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He own'd it to be his Copy-Book of    
his Letters to his
Correspondents.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Cowper.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We lay the stress upon this, that he said it 
was his Copy-Book
of his Letters to his Correspondents Abroad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you know Mr. <font>Buckley</font> laid a stress     
upon its being his
Hand-Writing.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then one <font>Rafter</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Show him the Copy-Book, look upon it,    
are you
acquainted with the Prisoner's Hand-Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rafter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is any part of that Book his             
Hand-Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rafter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I take it to be his Son's, <font>George         
Francia's</font> : The Prisoner writes
a smaller Hand. I take no part of it to be his Hand so far as I have 
gone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it may be of use for all the   
Witnesses to look it
over; we have four or five to this Point; and if I am rightly        
instructed, there
is not one Word in that Book wrote by the Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Justice <font>Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it is not his Writing, whose do    
you take it to be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rafter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't take it to be his.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Justice <font>Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose do you take it to be? Are you   
acquainted with
his Son's Hand?
<pagebreak id="55" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rafter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know whether it is his Son's or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. Justice <font>Pratt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are there any other Persons that      
write for him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rafter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He had sometimes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is a Letter of his own writing;   
pray let him look on
that, and see whether that is his Hand; do you believe that to be    
his writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rafter.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I don't think it is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Curtis</font> has prov'd that he own'd    
that Letter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Letter did I own?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Simon Francia</font> was called again.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you say to that Book?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is not one Syllable of his Writing in 
this Book; I have
known his Hand-Writing about twenty Years.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Barwell</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you acquainted with the Prisoner's   
Hand-Writing?
Is any of that Book of his writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Barwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None of it is his writing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know what Condition of Health he  
was in about
the latter end of the Year 1714, and 1715?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Barwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was sick.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For a Year before he was taken, what     
Condition was
he in? Was he able to write Letters?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Barwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was sick.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he use to write Letters in that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Barwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose Hand do you take it to be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Barwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do I know that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you acquainted with his Son's Hand?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Barwell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, not at all.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Simon Francia</font> was called again.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have look'd upon the Book; whose   
Hand-Writing do
you take it to be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know his Son's Hand-Writing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never had any Correspondence, or great    
Acquaintance with
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever see him write?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>S. Francia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember that I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will trouble you with but one piece of      
Evidence more; we
will call Dr. <font>Cade</font> , who attended him in his Sickness. We have     
offer'd
Evidence, that no part of that Book is his writing; we will now      
offer some
Proof that he was not capable of writing at that time.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Dr. <font>Cade</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Doctor, did you attend the Prisoner as    
his Physician at
any time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Cade.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was sent for to him on the second   
Day of 
<font>November</font> , 1714. I attended him till the 18th of the same Month, 
and within that
time I visited him nine Times, I found him in a great deal of Pain,  
and he
was lame in his Hand; sometime after my coming he grew better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he confin'd to his Bed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Cade.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometimes he kept his Bed, and sometimes he    
sate up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say he was in Pain, and lame in his Hand;  
which Hand
was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Cade.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember which; nor do I know any      
thing of him,
only at that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>J. Jekyll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Every one of the Letters were wrote after 
that time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Condition did you leave me in?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Cade.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a very bad Condition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not hear of the Condition I was in    
afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Dr. <font>Cade.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't remember that I heard any Thing of you 
after that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We will call a few Witnesses to prove what     
Circumstances
he was in, and that he was well affected to the Government.
<pagebreak id="56" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Instructions he appears to be a    
Foreigner, and so
disinterested in those unfortunate Divisions that are among us: And
accordingly there is nothing of Whig or Tory in his Letters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you remember when he came to     
<font>Newgate</font> he
wrote he liked his Company, for he found them all Tories.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We shall show you that he was zealous    
for the Good of
the Kingdom, and was against all that was disadvantageous to Trade   
in the
late Treaty of Peace. That he never went into any publick Places,    
except
to the <font>Grecian</font> Coffee-house, which is a Place sure not tainted   
with Sedition.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>Everall</font> was called again.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long have you known the Prisoner?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Several Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has he been peaceable, and easy in his         
Conversation, with
Respect to the Government?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Everall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember at the proclaiming the Peace he     
said, he thought
the Nation was ruin'd, for he thought it a scandalous Peace.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is much; for you make him a       
<font>Frenchman</font> , sure
he might have approved it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is not what I have in my Brief, but 
perhaps he
may recommend himself to your Esteem by it: He doth not to mine.
    My Lord, I will take up your Time only with this Remark: The great
Foundation of this Evidence is the Confession made by the Man himself.
Without the Key made by him, this had been applicable to no Body. I
remember Sir <font>Joseph Jekyll</font> was pleas'd to say, he would not      
excite the
Passions of the Jury, but rather appeal to their Judgments, so will  
I. Great
Part of this Correspondence <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Correspendence</comment> relates  
to Mr. <font>Harvey</font> , and one would have
thought they had something extraordinary to have charged on him, 
considering the Length of his Restraint; but I need not observe to   
the Jury
that he is at large. He was under Restraint, nothing could be        
imputed to
him, and he is discharged.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Francia</font> , Have you any Thing more to 
say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for my Nativity I have more Witnesses. I   
have more
Witnesses as to my Character. I have more Witnesses to prove that I  
was a
quiet Man, and never disaffected to the Government.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mr. <font>John Slater</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of the Prisoner's       
Behaviour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Slater.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have known him about four or five Years.   
There being a
Commission of Bankrupcy against him, I was recommended to assist him
in that Commission. I did give him the best Assistance I could, and I
several Times met him, sometimes at the <font>Grecian</font> Coffee-house,    
and sometimes
at my own House. I took him for a <font>Frenchman</font> , he used very much  
to espouse
the Interest of the King of <font>France</font> , which I used to chide him   
for. As for
Parties here, I had some Discourse with him, and he used to think we 
were
a strange People to fall out among our selves.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then <font>Thomas Richardson</font> was sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of the Prisoner and his 
Behaviour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richardson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have known him five or six Years, and I   
believe I have taken
five or six Pounds of his Money. When he was sick he took a Liking to
me, and would not be quiet unless I came often to see him, and I used
often to sit with him in the Evening and bear him Company, and it    
was a great
Surprize to me when I heard he was taken up, for he used often to    
drink a
Health to King <font>George</font> , and hoped he should get up to see him,   
and hoped
this would be a quiet Nation again. He was then so weak that he could
not stir Hand or Foot. But he used to call me <font>Vulcan</font> , and bid   
me drink
King <font>George's</font> Health.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hungerford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long is it since he was so weak that 
he could not
stir Hand or Foot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richardson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About a Year and five or six Months. And    
when he got
abroad, I then was forced to follow him for what he owed me, and I   
have
gone after him several Times to the <font>Grecian</font> Coffee-house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord C. Baron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any Thing more to offer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Prisoner.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
