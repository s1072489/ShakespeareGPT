or about the 2d day of <font>February</font> , which was in
the year of our Lord 1680. this Informant was taken with
great Pains in her Head and all her Limbs, which Pains
continued on her till neer or upon the first day of
<font>August</font> then following; and then this Informants Pains
began to abate, and this Informant was able to walk
abroad to take the Air: But in the Night-season she was
in much pain, and not able to take her rest.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Informant further saith, That upon or about
the 30th day of <font>September</font> now last past, this Informant
was going up the High Street of <font>Biddiford</font> , where this
<pagebreak id="8" />
Informant met with <font>Temperance Lloyd</font> of <font>Biddiford</font>
aforesaid Widow, and she the said <font>Temperance</font> did then
and there fall down on her Knees to this Informant, and
wept, (saying) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Grace</font> , I am glad to see you so strong
again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Upon which this Informant said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why dost thou weep
for me? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Unto which the said <font>Temperance</font> replied,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I
weep for Joy to see you so well again, </dialogue><nonSpeech>as the said
<font>Temperance</font> then pretended.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Informant further saith, That in that very night
she this Informant was taken very ill with sticking and
pricking Pains, as though Pins and Awls had been
thrust into her Body, from the Crown of her Head to
the Soles of her Feet; and this Informant lay as though
it had been upon a Rack.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And saith, That these pricking Pains have continued
upon her Body ever since; and that her Pains are much
worse by night than by day.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Informant further saith, That on Thursday the
first day of <font>June</font> last past in the night, she this
Informant was bound and seemingly chain'd up, with all her
sticking Pains gathered together in her Belly; so that
on a sudden her Belly was swoln as big as two Bellies,
which caused her to cry out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I shall die, I shall die</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and
in this sad condition this Informant lay as though she
had been dead for a long space (which those persons
that were in the Chamber with her this Informant did
compute to be about two hours).</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And this Informant further saith, That on 
Friday-night last, being the 30th day of <font>June</font> , this Informant
was again pinch'd and prick'd to the Heart, with such
cruel thrusting pains in her Head, Shoulders, Arms, Hands,
Thighs, and Legs, as though the Flesh would have been
<pagebreak id="9" />
then immediately torn from the Bones with a mans
Fingers and Thumbs.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further saith, That she was even pluck'd out
over her Bed, and lay in this condition for the space of
three hours (as she was informed by some of the said
persons then in this Informants Chamber).</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>This Informant further saith, That upon the first day
of this instant <font>July</font> , assoon as the aforesaid <font>Temperance
Lloyd</font> was apprehended and put in the Prison of
<font>Biddiford</font> , she this Informant immediately felt her pricking
and sticking pains to cease and abate.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And saith, That she hath continued so ever since
unto this time; but is still in great weakness of Body.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further saith, That she believeth that the said
<font>Temperance Lloyd</font> hath been an Instrument of doing much
hurt and harm unto her Body, by pricking and
tormenting of her in manner as before in this her Information
she hath set forth.</nonSpeech>
