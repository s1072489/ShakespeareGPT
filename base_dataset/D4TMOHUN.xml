   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray call your Witnesses together, and   
let me know who you begin with.
<pagebreak id="12" />   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M. At. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, We do not know what Place is      
designed for the Witnesses; but if they 
are to be on the other side, and this Croud do interpose between us  
and them, it will be
impossible for us, who are the King's Council, to hear what they     
say, or know how to proceed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There must be Room made there for    
the Witnesses; where are your
Witnesses Mr. <font>Attorney</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Clark of the Crown,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you please to name them Sir, we  
will call them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mr. <font>John Hudson</font> , and Mr. 
<font>George Powel</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not how this is ordered, but  
way must be made there by the Bar,
that the Prisoner may see the Witnesses, and they him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, by all means.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serjeant Tremaine.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If your Lordships please, the     
Witnesses will be most Conveniently heard,
if they come and stand here by us. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If your Lordships please, it will  
not be possible either for my Lord at 
the Bar, or for us to hear what the Witnesses say: Unless they be    
brought into this place to 
stand between us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Great Chamberlain, be        
pleased to give order for them to be 
brought in thither.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lord Great Chamberlain went down to the Bar.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord Great Chamberlain.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Witnesses must be brought   
to this place.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And accordingly, way was made for the Witnesses, as called to   
stand at the Bar between the
Prisoner and the Kings Councel.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Give me the Name of him that you     
begin with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We begin my Lords, with Mr.        
<font>John Hudson</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>who came to the Bar, and 
one of the Clerks held the Book to him, upon which he laid his Hand.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Clerk of the Crown.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hearken to your Oath Sir, the       
Evidence that you shall give on the behalf of 
our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queens Majesties, against   
<font>Charles</font> Lord <font>Mohun</font> the
Prisoner at the Bar, shall be Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing    
but the Truth: So help you
God.       
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then he kissed the Book.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Hudson</font> , Do you give my    
Lords an account what you know of any
Applications of Courtship made to Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> by Mr.        
<font>Hill</font> , and what became of it; and what 
you heard <font>Hill</font> say about her, or about any one else Relating to  
that matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I had the Honour to be invited to      
Supper with my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , at the
<font>Rose-Tavern</font> in <font>Covent-Garden</font> , where I found Captain         
<font>Hill</font> with his Lordship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was this Sir, tell the time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was three Nights before this unfortunate   
Accident hapned, there I found
Captain <font>Hill</font> , and we supped together; and after Supper,         
Captain <font>Hill</font> raised a Discourse of Mrs.
<font>Bracegirdle</font> and Mr. <font>Mountford</font> ; says He, I should not doubt  
the Success of my Amour with Mrs.
<font>Bracegirdle</font> , if I were not obstructed by <font>Mountford</font> , whom I 
design to be the Death of: This is
Truth upon my Oath. My Lord <font>Mohun</font> was in the Company; but I      
cannot say that my Lord
made any Reply to the thing, or took any notice of it: But this      
Captain <font>Hill</font> did say, not only
then, but several times before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say it at any other time in 
your Hearing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, several times before
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing more of this 
matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No more, than that my Lord <font>Mohun</font> that very  
Night that Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was killed,
and Captain <font>Hill</font> came into the Scene-Room of the Play-House, and 
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> had Captain, 
<font>Hills</font> Coat on, and Captain <font>Hill</font> had my Lord <font>Mohuns</font> Coat  
on, and they changed their Cloaths 
in the Play-House. I saw them change their Cloaths; but what their   
Design was, I cannot 
tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That very Night that the Gentleman that is      
Dead, Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , was killed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, that my Lord <font>Mohun</font>    
was present, when that Discourse of <font>Hill</font> 
was, about <font>Mounford</font> at the Tavern.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but I cannot say my Lord took any notice   
of it, for he made no Reply that I heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you done with this Witness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hudson.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is all that I know of the matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> , have you any     
thing to say to this Witness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then our next Witnesses Name is    
<font>George Powell</font> .  
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Who was Sworn in like manner.</nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Powell</font> , you have heard    
the Questions that have been asked, Mr. 
<font>Hudson</font> , Pray will you make Answers to them; and give my Lords   
an Account what you know 
of this matter.
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please Your Lordships, about 5 or 6 days 
before Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was 
Wounded, I was in Company with Captain <font>Hill</font> , and he began Mrs.  
<font>Bracegirdles</font> Health, I told him 
I would Pledge it. Says he, I am sure there is no Bar between me and 
Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , but 
<font>Mountford</font> ; and I am Resolved to be Revenged on him, one way or  
another. About 3 Days 
afterwards I was at Supper with my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Captain        
<font>Hill</font> , and another Gentleman, and 
the same Discourse arose again, and Captain <font>Hill</font> Whispered me in 
the Ear, says he, I am 
resolved to have the Blood of <font>Mountford</font> . I told him I did not   
think it fit for him to speak so 
behind a Gentleman's back, and to me who was his Friend. I said I    
would acquaint Mr. 
<font>Mountford</font> with what he said, and I did not doubt but he would    
give him the satisfaction of a
Gentleman for any Injury he did him. I heard no further Discourse at 
that time, nor do I 
know more of that matter, till the Night that Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was  
Wounded, when I saw him 
lying upon the Parlor Floor, and afterward saw him laid to Bed, and  
sate up all Night with 
him, and about four a Clock in the Morning I asked Mr. <font>Mountford</font> 
how the thing 
happened. He told me Captain <font>Hill</font> killed him basely; I asked him 
if his Sword was drawn; 
Yes, says he, but it was after I had received my Wound, for whilst   
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> talked to 
me <font>Hill</font> run me through.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At that time, when those Words were       
spoken at Supper, That he designed 
to be the Death of <font>Mountford</font> , was my Lord present?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord <font>Mohun</font> was present, but he was   
Talking to Colonel <font>Tredenham</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did my Lord <font>Mohun</font> say any thing to    
what <font>Hill</font> said?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not hear him make any Answer to it at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing else in Relation to 
this Fact?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing else but that Captain <font>Hill</font> did give 
a Letter to be delivered to Mrs.
<font>Bracegirdle</font> , but I know not whether it was delivered or not,    
and he often told me he would Marry
her with all his Heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say you had that Discourse with       
<font>Mountford</font> , when he lay a Dying.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was about four a Clock, and he died about One.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there any thing said about my Lord    
<font>Mohun</font> at that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing but that my Lord <font>Mohun</font> was Talking  
to him, whilst the other ran him 
through.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I understand you aright, you say      
nothing against my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , but 
his being by one time at Supper when <font>Hill</font> said some Words about  
<font>Mountford</font> ; and then the 
other thing you say is what <font>Mountford</font> told you after he was      
Wounded. That my Lord was 
Talking to him, when <font>Hill</font> gave him the Wound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Powell.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, My Lord, That is all that I heard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has your Lordship any thing to say to    
this Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, My Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The next Witness that we shall desire to  
call is Mrs. <font>Knight</font> . 

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Who was SWORN.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Knight.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have nothing to say to my Lord            
<font>Mohun</font> ; but what I have to say, is to 
Mr. <font>Hill</font> . About 4 days before Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was Killed, Mr. 
<font>Hill</font> came to me, and spoke 
to me about Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> : He told me he was satisfied she   
hated him, I told him I did 
not believe she hated any body, or loved any Body: Yes, he said, she 
did love some body, 
but he had thought of a way to be even with that Body. Upon the      
<font>Wednesday</font> Night before 
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was killed, he came to me as I was coming out of   
the Dressing Room; sayeth 
he, Mrs. <font>Knight</font> let me speak a Word with you, says he, you are   
very great with Mrs. 
<font>Bracegirdle</font> , and I desire you to be so kind, as to speak to her 
for me, and I would beg of you if 
you would give me leave to give her this Letter from me: No, said I, 
Mr. <font>Hill</font> , I beg your 
Pardon; you say she hateth you, and if she hateth you, she will not  
love any body that 
speaketh for you; and I am not fond of creating my self Enemies in   
the House, knowing I have 
some already. What Enemies, saith Mr. <font>Hill</font> , <font>Mountford</font> do    
you mean? And then repeating a 
great Oath, I shall find a way with him speedily.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A way, with what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Knight.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A way with him speedily, <font>Hill</font> said it   
of Mr. <font>Mountford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you call this Witness for, Mr.   
<font>Attorny</font> what use do you make of her
Evidence against my Lord <font>Mohun</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, the use that we would make of    
these Witnesses is to give an 
Account of the whole Fact from the Beginning to the End, <font>Hills</font>   
Malice, and what was the 
Occasion of it, his Design in coming there that Night, and what he   
did, and to leave it to 
your Lordships, to Judge what influence this will have, how far it   
will affect my Lord <font>Mohun</font> . 
The next Witness is Mrs. <font>Sandys</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is this Womans Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Elizabeth Sandys</font> .
<pagebreak id="14" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>She was SWORN.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Sandys</font> , give my Lords an        
Account, whether you were present with 
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> at the Tavern that day that Mr.    
<font>Mountford</font> was killed, and what 
passed there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sandys.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Dined with my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Captain      
<font>Hill</font> , at the <font>Three Tuns</font> in <font>Shandois-street</font> ,
and there arose a Discourse about Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> and           
<font>Hill</font> , and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> asked me, 
if I thought <font>Mountford</font> had lay with her or no. I said I could    
not tell; presently after says 
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , it will cost <font>Hill</font> 50 Guineas this Design.    
Saith Mr. <font>Hill</font> , if the Villain offers 
to resist I will Stab him; saith my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , I will stand by 
my Friend. When this was 
done, Mr. <font>Hill</font> desired Mr. <font>Brough</font> to borrow a Case of        
Pistols of Captain <font>Leister</font> , and he 
said he would not borrow them himself, for he doubted, if he knew of 
the Design he would 
not lend them. When that was done, Captain <font>Hill</font> told me he had a 
Coach and Six Horses 
in <font>Witch-Street</font> , to seize Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , and carry her  
away into the Country; and my 
Lord <font>Mohun</font> said, he would stand by his Friend: And when my Lord  
<font>Mohun</font> went away, 
<font>Hill</font> said to him; my Lord if you be not there by Six a Clock, I  
am Ruined. Saith my 
Lord <font>Mohun</font> , upon my Word and Honour I will be at the Play House 
by Six.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> , have you any thing   
to say to that Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, My Lord, I desire to have her asked,     
whether she is a Maid or a 
Married Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You hear the Question, but I do not know 
what use my Lord will make 
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You can easily answer, whether you are    
Married or Unmarried.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Question is very fair; are you a    
Married Woman, or a single 
Woman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sandys.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am a single Woman, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mrs. <font>Sandys</font> Repeat the Words     
that my Lord <font>Mohun</font> said, when <font>Hill</font> 
said if the Villain resisted, he would Stab him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sandys.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> said nothing in the World,    
but that he would stand by his 
Friend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any further Questions, <font>Mr.    
Attorny</font> to ask this Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have nothing more to ask her my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you my Lord <font>Mohun</font> ; would   
you ask her any thing else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then withdraw. 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Which she did.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The next Witness we call is <font>Mr.         
Rogers</font> .    

</dialogue><nonSpeech>Who was SWORN</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is this Witnesses Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rogers</font> , my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is his Christian Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>John.</font> If your Lordships please to     
remember, that the last Witness Mrs. 
<font>Sandys</font> said, That <font>Mr. Hill</font> desired my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , not   
to fail of being at the Play-House by Six a 
Clock, and that he was undone if he did not come; and my Lord        
promised upon his Word 
and Honour that he would come: Now we call this Witness to prove,    
that they met at the
Play-House according to the Appointment on the 9th of <font>December</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rogers.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, All that I know of this matter was,    
That my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Captain 
<font>Hill</font> were at the Play-House that Night, and that which made me   
take particular Notice of 
their being then at the Play-House, tho' they had been frequently    
there before together, was 
that Captain <font>Hill</font> had my Lord <font>Mohun's</font> Coat on, and my Lord   
<font>Mohun</font> had Captain <font>Hill's</font>
Coat on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe any thing else, when they 
were at the Play-House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rogers.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing but only some Words that passed between 
Captain <font>Hill</font> and my Lord 
<font>Mohun</font> , when I went to ask them for the overplus of the mony for 
coming in, because they 
came out of the Pit upon the Stage; he said he would not give it me, 
but if I brought any of 
our Masters, he would slit their Noses or something to that Effect.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr, Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak that over again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rogers.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I asked them for mony, that they ought to pay   
more than the rest that were in the
Pit, because they came upon the Stage, and they would not give it    
me, but he said if I 
brought any of our Masters, he would Slit their Noses, or cut their  
Faces, or to that 
Effect.
<pagebreak id="15" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, will your Lordship ask him  
any Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call another Witness then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, with your Lordships      
Favour, the next Witness that we 
shall call, is the Coach-Man, <font>William Dixon</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Who was Sworn.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Dixon</font> , do you remember    
the Day when Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was killed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray acquaint my Lords, what       
Persons you carryed in your Coach that 
Day, whether you carryed my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> , and to 
what place, and where you 
waited for them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it please your Lordships, Captain <font>Hill</font>    
and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> came in a Hackney
Coach to my Gate, where I live, and I was just a going to set my     
Coaches into the Street
for Hyre: They Bargained with me for six Horses, and I was to have   
thirty Shillings to set
them down at <font>Totteridge</font> on this side <font>Barnet</font> . I asked them   
whether they would have me bring
all the six Horses with the Coach, No they said, a pair would serve  
to the 
Play-House, and the other four should stand at the Pounds end. So I  
went accordingly 
to the place appointed, over against the <font>Horshooe-Tavern</font> in      
<font>Drury-Lane</font> , and a 
Foot-Man came, and Mr. <font>Hill</font> and he bid me drive down lower. So I 
drove to my 
Lord of <font>Clares</font> Door, or thereabouts; and there was some          
Souldiers that would have had me 
go in, and Smoak and Drink with them: I told them, I did never       
Smoak, and I did 
not care for Drinking any thing at that time. With that, my Lord     
<font>Mohun</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> 
came into the Coach, and as they bid me, I carryed them into         
<font>Norfolk Street</font> , below 
the Watch-House that stood there; they bid me turn about, and stand  
there; and then 
they went for a little time to the <font>White-Horse Tavern</font> , so I did 
turn about, and staid as they 
bid me, and they tarryed a pretty while before they came again, and  
then they bid me drive 
back to the place from whence I came, so I Drove into                
<font>Drury-Lane</font> , and they bid me stop next to 
my Lord <font>Craven's</font> House, this was about Ten a Clock, and it being 
so late, I went Home, and 
sent a Postillion down, to take care of the Coach, so that what      
passed afterwards, I cannot tell.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly my Lord, I cannot tell what Day it was, it 
was in <font>December</font> , as I take it, the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear of the Death of Mr.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it the same Day that you heard   
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was killed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not hear it till the next Morning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say, you went with my Lord     
<font>Mohun</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> into <font>Norfolk Street</font> ,
and there you stayed for them, whilst they went elsewhere.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know to what Houses they    
went?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They went to the <font>White-Horse Tavern</font> , to the 
hithermost House on this side the <font>Strand</font> ,
and they went below to a Door on this side of a House that is not    
finished yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you hear them use any          
Expressions there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard <font>Hill</font> say to my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , I    
think there is a Man and a Maid talking, it was
at the Corner House; saith <font>Hill</font> , we are Betrayed, Damme saith   
he, my Lord, let us go 
and Thresh him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they do then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did see them do nothing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whither did you carry them from    
thence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To the place from whence they came, in <font>Drury   
Lane</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will your Lordship say any thing to  
this man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Lord <font>Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire he may be asked, whether he had     
not Orders to go out of Town with 
us, as soon as Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> was put into the Coach.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dixon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it please you Sir, I had Order thus, that     
when we were to go out of Town, I
must Drive down into the <font>Strand</font> , and then round about any way   
that was readiest and clearest to
get to the Pound, that Order I had, and no other Order I had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who is your next Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorney General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, the next Witness we

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then she was Sworn.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , Pray give my Lords

<pagebreak id="16" />   
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was in <font>Prince's-Street</font>  
at Supper at Mr. <font>Page's</font> , and at ten a 
Clock at Night, <font>Mr. Page</font> went Home with me; and coming down      
<font>Drury Lane</font> , there stood a 
Coach by my Lord <font>Craven's</font> Door, and the Boot of the Coach was    
down, and a great many 
men stood by it; and just as I came to the Place where the Coach     
stood, two Soldiers came 
and pulled me from <font>Mr. Page</font> , and four or five more came up to   
them, and they knocked my 
Mother down almost, for my Mother and my Brother were with me. My    
Mother recovered, 
and came and hung about my Neck, so that they could not get me into  
the Coach, and <font>Mr. Page</font> 
went to call Company to rescue me. Then <font>Mr. Hill</font> came with his   
Sword drawn, and struck at 
<font>Mr. Page</font> and my Mother; and when they could not get me into the  
Coach, because Company 
came in, he said he would see me Home, and he led me by one Hand,    
and my Mother by the 
other. And when we came Home, he pulled <font>Mr. Page</font> by the Sleeve,  
and said, Sir, I would 
speak with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle</font> , did you see   
any Body in the Coach when they pulled 
you to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord <font>Mohun</font> was in the     
Coach; when they pulled me to the 
Coach, I saw my Lord <font>Mohun</font> in the Coach. And when we came Home,  
<font>Hill</font> pulled <font>Mr. Page</font> 
by the Sleeve, and said he would speak with him. As they led me      
along <font>Drury Lane</font> , my Lord 
<font>Mohun</font> came out of the Coach, and followed us, and all the        
Soldiers followed them, but they 
were dismissed, and, as I said, when we came to our Lodging, then    
<font>Hill</font> pulled <font>Mr. Page</font> by the 
Sleeve, and said, he would speak with him. Saith <font>Mr. Page</font> ,      
<font>Mr. Hill</font> , another time will do, 
to Morrow will serve; with that, when I was within Doors,            
<font>Mr. Page</font> was pulled into the 
House, and <font>Mr. Hill</font> walked up and down in the Street with his    
Sword drawn. He had his 
Sword drawn when he came along with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe him to say any thing      
whilst he was with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I was going down the Hill, he      
said, as he led me, he would be 
revenged.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he name of whom he would be revenged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did not name of whom then, but     
when I was in the House, several
Persons went to the Door, and afterwards <font>Mrs. Brown</font> went to the  
Door, and spoke to them, and 
asked them what they staid and walked there for; at last, they said, 
they staid to be 
revenged of <font>Mr. Mountford</font> , and then <font>Mrs. Brown</font> came in to   
me, and told me of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who said that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Hill</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. General.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and            
<font>Mr. Hill</font> both together when that was said, that 
they staid to be revenged of <font>Mr. Mountford</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes they were. And when               
<font>Mrs. Brown</font> came in and told me, I sent my
Brother and the Maid, and all the People we could, out of the House  
to <font>Mrs. Mountford</font> , to desire 
her to send, if she knew where her Husband was, to tell him of it,   
and she did. And when 
they came in a Doors again, I went to the Door, and the Doors were   
shut, and I listened to 
hear if they were there still, and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and             
<font>Mr. Hill</font> were walking up and down the 
Street; and by and by, the Watch came up to them, and when the       
Watch came, they said, 
Gentlemen, Why do you walk with your Swords drawn? Says my Lord      
<font>Mohun</font> , I am a Peer 
of <font>England</font> , touch me if you dare.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Repeat that again, for I could not   
well hear you: Do you speak of what 
you heard from <font>Mrs. Brown</font> , or what you observed your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was within Doors, but I    
was listening at the Door, and heard 
this my self; they came up to them, and said, Gentlemen, Why do you  
walk with your Swords 
drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who asked that Question?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Watch; and, says my Lord          
<font>Mohun</font> , I am a Peer of <font>England</font> , touch 
me if you dare. Then the Watch left them, and they went away, and a  
little after, there was 
a Cry of Murder, and that is all that I know, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire this Witness may be       
asked, how long after this Passage 
that she speaketh of, was it that she heard Murder cryed in the      
Street.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You hear the Question,               
<font>Mrs. Bracegirdle</font> , What say you to it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I believe it was about a     
quarter of an Hour after, to the best of
my Memory.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you mean, a quarter of an    
Hour after the Watch asked the 
Question?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Then the Earl of</font> Mulgrave <font>stood up</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lord High Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mulgrave</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. of Mulgrave.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire to ask this Witness a 
question. If I heard her aright, I think 
she said, they threaten'd to be Revenged of Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , I    
desire to know of her, whether my 
Lord <font>Mohun</font> did threaten him.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not know indeed; but when Mrs.    
<font>Browne</font> asked them what they 
staid there for? They said to be Revenged of Mr. <font>Mountford</font> . I   
did not hear them my 
self, but Mrs. <font>Browne</font> came in and told me so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , I think, if I did   
not mistake, you said, when the Watch 
came up, they asked them, why their Swords were drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> made        
answer, he was a Peer of <font>England</font> ,
and bid them touch him if they durst, and they went away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, the next Witness that we call,    
shall be Mr. <font>Gawen Page</font> , at

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Page</font> , I suppose you remember the

Supped at your House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray give an account of your whole       
Knowledge about this Matter, 
What happen'd that Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About Ten a Clock at Night, on <font>Friday</font> the  
Ninth of <font>December</font> last, going 
down <font>Drury-Lane</font> with Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , whom I Led just      
against my Lord <font>Craven's</font> House. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Sir, speak out, and tell us what    
time it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About Ten a Clock at Night, on <font>Friday</font> the  
Ninth of <font>December</font> last, going 
down <font>Drury-Lane</font> , and leading Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , right       
against my Lord <font>Craven's</font> Door, stood 
a Coach, where two Soldiers pressed in between me and Mrs.           
<font>Bracegirdle</font> , and parted us: 
I asked what that was for? But they took hold of Mrs.                
<font>Bracegirdle</font> , and immediately they 
would have forced her into the Coach; Capt. <font>Hill</font> , whom I saw    
there with his Sword 
drawn, made several Blows at me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who would have forced her into the Coach?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Soldiers would.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray go on Sir, what follow'd after that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say, Capt. <font>Hill</font> made several Blows at    
me, and Cry'd you Villain, Stand. 
I received several of them upon my Cane, but there was none that     
hurt me; then I got 
Help, and they were prevented of carrying Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> away. 
My Lord <font>Mohun</font> 
was in the Coach; I saw him in the Coach.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see any Arms in the Coach?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw no Arms, but I saw a Bundle in the       
Coach, tho I could not tell 
what it was; and there was one in the Coach, that I saw was my Lord  
<font>Mohun</font> . So when 
we had got Help, we went down the Lane to Convey her home, and Capt. 
<font>Hill</font> was 
with us, and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> followed at a distance. Capt.         
<font>Hill</font> said to the Soldiers, 
<font>Be gone, I have nothing more to do with you now</font> . When we came   
to the House and Mrs. 
<font>Bracegirdle</font> was entring in, Captain <font>Hill</font> pull'd me by the    
Sleeve, and said he would speak
with me. Said I, to Night is not a fit time, to Morrow is better,    
therefore pray stay 
till to Morrow Morning. But said he, <font>God Damme, you will not go    
Home to Night</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You speak so low, that I cannot tell     
what you say; I did not hear 
that last that you said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I say, when Captain Hill pull'd me by 
the Sleeve, and said he 
would speak with me, I told him, that Night was not a fit time, to   
Morrow would do 
better: Well, saith he, <font>To Morrow then; but, God Damn me, you will 
not go out to Night</font> 
I went in a Doors, and there my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and he staid for an   
Hour and a half, as I 
was told; I saw them not my self: But Mrs. <font>Browne</font> came in and    
said, that they said, 
they waited to be Revenged.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whom did they mean, your self that they    
would be Revenged of?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Browne</font> said, they waited for          
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you continue in that House till after

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes Sir, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long after you came into the House   
was the Fact done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About an Hour and an half.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you your self hear or observe any    
thing to be said or done, from 
the time you came into the House, to the time the Fact was committed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I was in the Back Room of the     
House,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Mr. <font>Page</font> , did you see Mr.       
<font>Mountford</font> after he was Wounded?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then give my Lords an account what passed  
at that Visit.
<pagebreak id="18" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the outcry of Murder, I came out into the 
Street, where I found 
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> just Surrendring himself to the Constable; and     
immediately I went 
to Mr. <font>Mountford's</font> House, and I found him lying all along in his 
Blood upon the Floor; 
he seeing me, desired me to lift him up, which I did, and thinking   
he had been Dying, I 
asked him whether he knew me. He said Yes. Said I to him, Had you    
time to draw your 
Sword in your Defence? He said, <font>He was barbarously run Through     
before he could Draw 
it</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this all you have to say, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will your Lordship ask this Witness any  
Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire he may be asked whether my  
Sword was Drawn when 
I Surrendred my self to the Constable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, your Sword was in the Scabbard     
when you Surrendred your
self, but I cannot say that your Sword was Drawn before, or not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The next Witness that we desire to call,   
is Mrs. <font>Page</font> .

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (She was Sworn.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is the Name of this Witness?

do you remember the Night when 
Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> Supped at your House, and Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was 
Killed? Acquaint my

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> Supped at my Lodging,    
and my Husband went home with 
her, and staying something longer than ordinary, I sent my Servant   
to know what was 
the reason of it: He brought me word back, that my Husband had like  
to have been 
Murdered, and Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> carried away. With that I went    
down my self towards 
Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle's</font> Lodgings, and there I found my Lord <font>Mohun</font> 
and Mr. <font>Hill</font> walking, 
Mr. <font>Hill</font> with his Sword Drawn before Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle's</font>      
Door; my Lord <font>Mohun's</font> not. 
So I went in, into the House; and after I had staid a while there,   
Mrs. <font>Browne</font> came out 
to them, and asked them why they Staid there? They made answer, they 
staid for Mr.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were their Swords Drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Hill's</font> then was, my Lord <font>Mohun's</font>

desired me to go over to Mrs. 
<font>Mountford's</font> House, and speak to her to send to her Husband, and  
desire him to keep 
where he was, or come home with a good Guard, whilst I was telling   
Mrs. <font>Mountford</font> 
what I was desired to tell her -- But I should have told your        
Lordships, that when 
I came out to go to Mrs. <font>Mountford</font> , my Lord <font>Mohun</font> had then  
his Sword Drawn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they there when you went out of Mrs.

Lodgings?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And are you sure, that at that time when  
you went out of Mrs. 
<font>Bracegirdle's</font> House, my Lord <font>Mohun</font> had his Sword Drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure of it, that when I went out, my     
Lord <font>Mohun</font> had then his Sword 
Drawn; that was the Second time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out of whose House was that you went?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out of Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle's</font> Lodgings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where were they when you saw his Sword   
Drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were walking before Mrs.                 
<font>Bracegirdle's</font> Door, from one end of the 
Street <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Srreet</comment> to the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Street is that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Howard-Street.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray describe to my Lords that Street.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They that stand in that Street, can see who   
goeth down to Mr. <font>Mountford's</font>
House, and who goeth up <font>Surry-Street</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well now go on.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whilst I was desiring Mrs. <font>Mountford</font> to   
send away to her Husband, I heard
Murder cry'd out; immediately I open'd Mr. <font>Mountford's</font> Door, and 
he came in, and 
fell with his Arms round about my Neck to support himself, I         
suppose, and he said, 
<font>Hill</font> had Murder'd him. I helped him as far as the Parlor Door,   
and there down he 
fell. I went up the Street and called out <font>Murder</font> , and my Lord   
<font>Mohun</font> came to me,
and bid me take notice, he had no hand in the Murder, for his Sword  
was not Drawn. 
I told him, I could not tell that, for to my knowledge he had been   
in Mr. <font>Hill's</font>
Company with his naked Sword just before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mrs. <font>Browne</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have nothing so say to that Witness  
my Lord, have you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this all you have to say, Mrs. <font>Page</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> After this, my Lord <font>Mohun</font> resign'd        
himself up to the Constable, the 
Constable standing by me, I bid him Secure my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , which 
he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire to ask this Witness,        
whether I Surrendred my self, or 
made Opposition, or offered to run away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No my Lord, the Constable laid hold on you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Answer do you make to my Lord's     
Question?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say, my Lord, the Constable laid hold upon  
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to ask her, whether I did not        
Surrender my self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not till I had desired the Constable to       
Secure your Lordship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did I make any Opposition, or offer to run    
away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, for the Constable presently took hold of  
your Lordship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire she may be asked whether <font>Hill</font>    
Run away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I know not; I suppose he was gone away   
out of the Street before 
I came forth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Swear Mrs. <font>Browne</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which was done.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Browne</font> , you are upon your Oath,  
pray declare to my Lords 
what you know happen'd upon that Night that Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was    
Killed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If it please your Lordships, when Mrs.      
<font>Bracegirdle</font> came Home, I found 
her Crying? I asked her what was the matter? She said, my Lord       
<font>Mohun</font> , and Mr. 
<font>Hill</font> , had run her into a Coach, with six or seven Soldiers, and 
lifted her into the 
Coach, and she said they were at the Door. Upon which, I went to the 
Door, and 
saw my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> walking along. Said I, are    
you the Gentlemen 
that have used Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> in this manner? My Lord          
<font>Mohun</font> answered, Madam,
said he, <font>I Protected her; if it had not been for me, the Rabble    
would have torn her a 
pieces; for if we had had a mind to carry her away, we had six or    
seven Pistols Charged 
in the Coach, and could easily have suppressed the Tumult</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not hear what this Witness saith,   
she speaketh so low.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> said, they had Six or     
Seven Pistols in the Coach, and 
could easily have suppressed the Rabble, if they would have carried  
her away; but 
he had no Design upon her for his own part, but only to serve his    
Friend; and that 
Mr. <font>Hill's</font> design was to take her out of Town, and keep her a    
Week, and see if he 
could perswade her to Marry him; and saith Mr. <font>Hill</font> , <font>I shall  
light on this</font> Mountford. 
Why, said I to him, What hurt hath Mr. <font>Mountford</font> done you? Saith 
he, <font>I have been 
Abused, and I will be Revenged</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was <font>Hill</font> that said so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. So I went and told Mrs. <font>Mountford</font>  
of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray acquaint my Lords what my Lord        
<font>Mohun</font> said to you about 
this Matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> said, he protected her,   
for if it had not been for 
him, the <font>Mob</font> had torn her in pieces; but if they had had a mind  
to carry her off, 
they could easily have suppressed the <font>Mob</font> , for they had six or  
seven Pistols in the 
Coach: But saith my Lord, <font>I had no design upon her my self, but    
only to serve my 
Friend</font> . So saith Mr. <font>Hill</font> , <font>I shall light upon this         
Mountford</font> . Why, said I, what hurt 
hath Mr. <font>Mountford</font> done you? Saith he, <font>I have been Abused, and 
I will have my Revenge</font> . 
So I went and told Mrs. <font>Mountford</font> of it. About half an Hour      
after, or more, <font>Mr.
Mountford</font> came down, and when he came down, I saw him a little     
before he came 
to them, and went to him, and would fain have spoke to him, but he   
would not 
stay to let me speak what I had to say to him, but going on,         
presently he met my 
Lord <font>Mohun</font> . Saith he, <font>Your Humble Servant, my Lord</font> . Saith  
my Lord again, <font>Your Servant</font> 
Mr. Mountford. Saith my Lord, <font>I have a great Respect for you</font> ,   
Mr. Mountford, <font>and would
have no Difference between us; but there is a thing fallen out       
between Mr.</font> Hill <font>and Mrs.</font>  
<pagebreak id="20" />
Bracegirdle. Saith Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , <font>My Lord, has my Wife        
disobliged your Lordship? if she has, 
she shall ask your Pardon; but as for</font> Mrs. Bracegirdle, <font>she is   
no concern of mine; and I hope your 
Lordship will not vindicate such an ill Man as</font> Mr. Hill <font>in such  
a matter as this. Upon that I 
heard</font> Mr. Hill <font>bid</font> Mr. Mountford <font>draw</font> , Mr. Mountford      
<font>said, that I will; and drew his 
Sword; but whether he received his Wound before he drew his Sword,   
or after, I cannot tell</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak that last again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Mountford</font> and my Lord met; saith    
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , your Servant, my 
Lord; saith my Lord, Your Servant, Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , I have a      
great respect for you, 
and would have no difference be between us; but here has been a      
thing fallen out 
between Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> ; saith Mr.            
<font>Mountford</font> presently again, Has my 
Wife disobliged your Lordship? If she has, she shall ask your        
Pardon. But Mrs. 
<font>Bracegirdle</font> is no concern of mine: I know nothing of this        
matter, I come here by accident.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who said they came there by accident?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Mountford</font> said, I know nothing of   
this matter, I come here by 
accident. But, I hope, your Lordship will not vindicate <font>Hill</font> in  
such Actions as 
these are: Upon that, I heard Mr. <font>Hill</font> bid Mr. <font>Mountford</font>     
draw, Mr. <font>Mountford</font> said 
he would, and drew his Sword; but whether he receiv'd his Wound      
before or after, I
cannot tell; it was in the Night.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Lord <font>Godolphin</font> stood up.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Godolphin</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Godolphin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Steward</font> , I desire this       
Witness may be asked, whether my 
Lord <font>Mohun's</font> Sword was drawn when he talked with <font>Mountford</font> , 
because the Council 
opened it before, that the Watch came to them, and saw them with     
their Swords drawn 
when they were walking in the Street.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. you heard my Lord's Question: Was   
my Lord <font>Mohun's</font> Sword 
drawn whilst he talked with <font>Mountford</font> , or no?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not remember I did see my Lord         
<font>Mohun's</font> Sword drawn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they near together?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were near together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire she may be asked whether I went up   
the Street to meet Mr. 
<font>Mountford</font> , or he came down to me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You heard the Question, Mistress, what   
say you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Mountford</font> came down to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire she may be asked whether she did not 
go to hinder Mr. <font>Mountford</font> 
from coming that way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brown</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did go to speak to him, but he did not 
hear me speak, or did not 
hearken to me; I took him by the Hand, and told him I would speak    
with him, but 
he did not hear me, but went on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You did not tell him upon what account you 
would have spoke with 
him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I had not time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire she may be asked, whether Mr.        
<font>Mountford's</font> Sword was within his 
Arm, or by his Side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was by his Side.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire she may be asked one Question more,  
whether he could not have 
went home, without coming to Mr. <font>Hill</font> and me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did come out of his way, his way was not 
by my House; he did 
come down the Street towards them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire your Lordships to take notice, that  
he came out of his way to me. 
I desire to aske her: Did he come as if he was going to his own      
House or yours?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As if he was coming to mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire to ask her, whether I had any hand   
in killing Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , or 
went to hold him, or meddled with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Browne.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not that I did see.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any more to say to this Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor your Lordship?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then the next Witness we desire to call,   
is, <font>Richard Row</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Who was Sworn.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Richard Row</font> , where do you live?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Surry-street</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where doth he Live saith he?
<pagebreak id="21" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Surry-street</font> , my Lord. Pray how    
near is that to the Place where 
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was Killed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About ten or twelve Pole.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you observe my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Mr.  
<font>Hill</font> that Night, and where 
were they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All that I can say to the matter in that Case is,  
I was in my own House about 
a quarter after Ten a Clock, and I heard a noise in the Street, and  
I went out, and 
saw two Gentlemen and two Lads about the middle of the Channel; one  
of the Lads 
had one of the Gentlemen by the Arm, just by the Channel, and said,  
<font>Pray my Lord, Good 
my Lord, don't do it, alter your Resolution</font> . There was an Answer  
made, that they would 
be Revenged that Night, or to Morrow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know who the Boy was that used that 
Expression?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, it was very Dark.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you not know neither who returned the   
Answer?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you are sure you heard those words pass?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes indeed, and I went to the Door afterwards,     
whilst they went to the 
upper end of the Street and returned again; and I saw Captain        
<font>Hill's</font> Boy following him. 
My Lord, I knew Capt. <font>Hill</font> , tho he was not in the Cloaths he    
formerly used to come 
to my House in, and the Boy I knew to be his Boy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were those Persons together that you heard 
speaking so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, all four together, in a Confusion they seemed 
to be, for they were 
Pushing to and agen, and the Boy had hold of one of the Gentlemen's  
Arms when he bid 
him alter his Resolution.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Repeat those Words again that you heard    
him say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pray my Lord, good my Lord, do not do it, alter  
your Resolution.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Has your Lordship any thing to ask this  
Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I spoke of this same afterwards, and so they have  
brought me here to give 
Evidence: That is all that I can say. I cannot Swear to my Lord      
<font>Mohun</font> , that he was 
one, I do not know that ever I saw him to my knowledge in my Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>E. of Mulgrave.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord Steward, I desire he may be     
asked, whether he knoweth 
who that Boy was that made that Answer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was no answer made by any Boy, but begging   
and praying, <font>That my 
Lord would not do it</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>E. of <font>Mulgrave.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know who that Boy was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Row.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I do not know what Boy it was. But when I      
heard Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was 
Killed, and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> was concerned, I told what I had       
heard and seen, and so 
they bring me here to Evidence it. That is all I can say to the      
matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, we desire next to call some of    
the Watch, and shall begin 
with <font>Merry</font> .   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Who was Sworn.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is his Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>William Merry</font> . Mr. <font>Merry</font> , I      
think you are Beadle of the Parish.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Merry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray acquaint my Lords what you observed   
that Night Mr. <font>Mountford</font> 
was Killed, when you saw my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Mr. <font>Hill</font> , the    
first time and the second 
time, when my Lord <font>Mohun</font> was Taken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Merry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I first came down the Street, walking the   
Rounds between Eleven and 
Twelve a Clock, as I turned at the Corner out of <font>Surry-street</font>    
into <font>Howard-street</font> , I saw my 
Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Capt. <font>Hill</font> Walking, that is, upon the Paved   
Stones; my Lord was 
walking towards me, and I asked, Who comes there? Saith my Lord, a   
Friend. Said 
I, What is the meaning of your Swords being Drawn? Return your       
Swords, and 
stand off. With that, he returned his Sword immediately. Saith he,   
<font>I am a Peer of the 
Land; here, will you have my Sword</font> ? and he profered me his Sword; 
but the 
Constable was not there then, and I did not take his Sword; but,     
said I, God Bless your 
Honor my Lord, I know not what you are, but I hope you are doing no  
harm; No, 
saith he. With that, the Constable came immediately, and he profered 
the same to 
him; there were two Candles in some Maids, or Womans hands at a Door 
hard by, and 
I went to ask them if they knew the meaning of it; and there being a 
Neighbours Man 
leaning with a Bottle and a Glass against the Wall, whom I knew. I   
think they told 
me one of them had a Sweet-heart there; and my Lord said, he was     
drinking a Lady's 
Health, and as soon as his Bottle was out, he would be gone. That is 
all I heard of the 
matter.
<pagebreak id="22" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr. <font>Hill</font> there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Merry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was his Sword Drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Merry.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, his Sword was drawn, and I asked what made  
that Gentleman with 
his Sword Drawn? and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> said, he had lost his         
Scabbard; but seeing this 
Neighbour's Man stand there, I went to the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were both their Swords drawn at first?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Merry</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Both their Swords were Drawn when I came first    
into the Street; but my 
Lord put up his Sword, and the other continued Drawn, by reason as   
they said, he 
had lost his Scabbard. And so seeing, as I said, my Neighbour's Man  
standing there, 
we went to that House to enquire if they knew what their Business    
was; we were not 
got into the House, I am sure not a Stone's cast within the House,   
but Murder was
cry'd out, and we came back again, and my Master being nimbler of    
Foot than I, 
because he was a younger Man, came first into the Place, and Seized  
My Lord before 
I came; how the Seizing was I do not know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our next Witness is <font>Thomas Fennell</font> .

two parts; I went down <font>Surry-Street</font> with one Party; the          
Constable he went down 
<font>Strand-Lane</font> with the other Party. We were four or five that came 
down <font>Surry-Street</font> , and 
when we came down, my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Capt. <font>Hill's</font> Swords     
were both Drawn; 
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> put up his Sword just as we came down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak out Man, that my Lords may all     
hear you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fennel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say, the Constable and his Party went down    
<font>Strand-Lane</font> , and another 
Party down <font>Surry-street</font> , four or five of us, and my Lord        
<font>Mohun</font> and Capt. <font>Hill</font> had both 
their Swords Drawn: When we came down, my Lord put up his Sword just 
as we 
came down, but the Constable not being come, I went and called him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You say both their Swords were Drawn when  
you came down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fennel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but my Lord put up his Sword just as we    
came down.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What time of Night was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fennel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was between Eleven and Twelve.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long before the Murder was committed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fennel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A quarter of an Hour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you not say, they put up their Swords 
as soon as you came 
down?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fennel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> put up his Sword, but         
<font>Hill</font> said he had never a Scabbard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ask them why they had their Swords 
drawn at that time of 
Night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fennel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I went to call the Constable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any more to ask of this Witness?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have not my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nor you my Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray go on then; whom do you produce next?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our next Witness is <font>James Bassit</font> 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Who was Sworn.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you one of the Watch that Night Mr.   
<font>Mountford</font> was Killed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see my Lord <font>Mohun</font> and Capt.    
<font>Hill</font> that Night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Acquaint my Lords where it was, and in     
what manner you found 
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In <font>Howard-street</font> ; I came along with the     
Constable, and I walked before 
them that went down <font>Surry-Street</font> with my Lanthorn, and there was  
my Lord 
<font>Mohun</font> with his Sword Drawn, and Capt <font>Hill</font> with his the like: 
We asked them, what 
<pagebreak id="23" />
they did there? They said they were drinking of a Bottle of Wine:    
<font>Hill</font> said to me,
you may knock me down if you please: Nay, said I, we never use to    
knock any 
Gentlemen down, unless there be occasion; and then we went into      
<font>Norfolk-street</font> to the 
Tavern to examine what they were, and what they were doing; and in   
the mean time 
the Murder was done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you not ask them why their Swords were 
drawn?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hill</font> made answer that he had lost his       
Scabbard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What said my Lord <font>Mohun</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord <font>Mohun</font> had put up his Sword by that  
time we came up to him: That 
is all I can say to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you have nothing more to ask him,     
call another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire he may be asked whether he  
came with the Constable 
when I surrendred my self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and I took hold of your Sleeve, and you    
shook and quak'd and trembled,
as if you would tear it to pieces.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I desire he may be asked whether my Sword was 
in the Scabbard when I
surrendred my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was, he surrendred it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was after the Murder was done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With your Lordship's Favour, I desire he   
may answer my Lord 
<font>Mohun's</font> first Question again, so as to be heard by your          
Lordships; What was that you were 
saying when my Lord surrendred himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I took him by the Arm when he surrendred        
himself up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he quaked, and I had him away to the       
<font>Round-House</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hear my Question, you say you took him   
by the Sleeve, when he 
surrendred himself; what do you mean by that? is it that he had      
surrendred himself 
before you laid hold on him, or afterwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I took hold of his Arm, when he surrendred      
himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But was it before he surrendred himself  
to the Constable?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, it was afterwards, my Lord; to have him away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you did see him surrender himself   
to the Constable?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bassit.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then call Mr. <font>Charles Knowles</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>But  
he did not appear.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whom do you call next, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, we call'd Mr. <font>Charles          
Knowles</font> ; but they say, he is not 
come, therefore with your Lordships favour, we will call Mrs.        
<font>Brewer</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> (Who was sworn.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Brewer</font> , I think, you live at the 
next Door to Mrs. <font>Bracegirdles's</font> 
Lodging?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray give my Lords an account what you saw 
and heard that Night 
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> was kill'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was at Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle's</font> House, and  
I went to the Door with them; 
and just as I went to the Door, my Lord <font>Mohun</font> came up to me; and 
just as he came to 
the Door, Mr. <font>Mountford</font> came down the Street, and my Lord went   
to him, and 
imbraced him, and said, Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , Your humble Servant, I   
am glad to see you; 
Who is this said Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , my Lord <font>Mohun</font> ? Yes said my 
Lord. What 
makes your Lordship here at this time a night, saith Mr.             
<font>Mountford</font> ? Saith my Lord 
again, I suppose Mr. <font>Mountford</font> you was sent for; sent for, for   
what saith he? You have 
heard of the business of Mrs. <font>Bracegirdle</font> , I suppose, saith my  
Lord: No my Lord, saith 
he, I come by chance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who said that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, go on and speak aloud.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, Mr. <font>Mountford</font> . -- </dialogue><nonSpeech>And there 
she hesitated, and seemed 
to be in a Confusion.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is not used to such publick            
Examinations: If your Lordships will 
please to allow her to begin again, because she is in some           
Confusion, she will be the 
better able to give you what account she can of this matter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let her recollect her self, and begin    
again.
<pagebreak id="24" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When Mr. <font>Mountford</font> came down the        
Street, I stood at the Door, and 
my Lord <font>Mohun</font> was come to the Door, and my Lord <font>Mohun</font> went   
to him and said, 
Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , <font>your Humble Servant, I am glad to see you</font> ,  
and Embraced him. Saith Mr. 
<font>Mountford</font> , <font>Who is this, my Lord</font> Mohun? <font>Yes</font> , saith he,  
<font>it is. What maketh your Lordship 
here at this time of night</font> ? saith my Lord <font>Mohun</font> , <font>I suppose 
you are sent for</font> Mr. Mountford. 
<font>No indeed</font> , said he, I <font>came by chance</font> . Saith my Lord, <font>You 
have heard of the Business of Mrs.</font>
Bracegirdle. With that, after he had said this, Mr. <font>Hill</font> cometh  
up, and saith, <font>Pray, 
my Lord, hold your Tongue, this is not a convenient time to          
discourse this Business</font> , and would 
have drawn my Lord away. Saith Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , <font>I am very sorry 
my Lord, to see that 
your Lordship should assist Capt.</font> Hill <font>in so ill an Action as    
this; pray, let me desire your Lordship 
to forbear</font> . Upon this, as soon as he had said so, Mr. <font>Hill</font>    
came up and struck Mr.
<font>Mountford</font> a Box on the Ear. Saith Mr. <font>Mountford</font> , <font>Damme,   
what's that for</font> ? And with 
that, he whipped out his Sword and made a Pass at him, and I turned  
about and 
cry'd out <font>Murder, Murder</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you say, you saw <font>Hill</font> draw his     
Sword, and make a Pass at 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, his Sword was drawn before; but he      
immediately after the Box on
Ear, made a Pass at him, and I turned about and cry'd <font>Murder</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had  Mr. <font>Mountford</font> his Sword drawn at  
that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he had not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you sure he had not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I am sure he had not, for as soon as   
he struck the Blow, he made
a Pass at him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was my Lord present at that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He stood just by on the Right-hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How near to them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Brewer.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Mr. <font>Brewer.</font> </comment> They were 
all close together as well as I could discern.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, have you any mind to ask this   
Witness any Questions?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Mohun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. Steward.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you done with her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord. The next Witness we desire   
to call is Mr. <font>Davenport</font> , the
Constable.
