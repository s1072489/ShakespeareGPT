 <head>A DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
TWO YOUNG LADIES
LATELY MARRIED, <font>&amp;C.</font> </head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Amy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Welcome, my dear <font>Lucy</font> ! I
have long'd to see you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sweet <font>Amy</font> ! I have
had no less impatience for your dear
Company. Lord! how you're alter'd,
methinks you seem more beautiful than
ever: A very Angel!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, <font>Lucy</font> , do you begin to abuse
me thus already?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I vow; you appear such in
my eye, really.
<pagebreak id="4" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Perhaps my new Mantua adds to
my little Beauty: You like the Fashion
then? 'Tis the newest Stuff.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I live, I never saw any thing
more pretty; sure 'tis all Spanish Wool.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes, the Wool is Spanish, but
it was Dyed at <font>Venice</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is no Silk can wear neater --
And what a delicate Colour! -- For
Heaven's sake, from whence had you this
Noble Present?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From whence, <font>Lucy</font> ? From whom
should a Vertuous Wife receive it but from
her Husband?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh happy you, who have such a
Husband! wou'd I had Married a Cobler
when I met with my Bargain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now, Friend! do you repent
already?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How is it possible I shou'd do
otherwise? do you see these Rags, and how I
am dizen'd? Thus it goes with my
Husband's Wife. Let me dye, if I am not
ashamed to appear in Publick, when I
perceive how genteel other Women go, whose
Husbands are much inferior to mine both
for Quality and Estate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The true Ornament of Wifes does
not consist in Apparel, or Dress, as we are
taught by St. <font>Peter</font> , (for I heard this of
<pagebreak id="5" />
Mr. <font>Fleet---d</font> lately in a Sermon) but in
chast and modest Behaviour, and in the
imbellishments of the Mind. Let the
tawdry Misses of the Times seek, by their
gay Dress, to attract the admiration of
many Eyes; we, that are Marry'd, ought
to esteem our selves fine enough if we
please our Husbands only.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, in the mean time, my good
Man, tho' he be so very penurious to his
Wife, is other ways sufficiently profuse in
wasting that fair Estate which I brought
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In those Debauchees which are most
pleasing to his wicked nature, Wine, Dice,
and Whores.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! good words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis even so, <font>Amy</font> : And when,
at length, after a tedious expectation on
my part, he comes home between One
and Two in the Morning, Drunk as <font>David's</font>
Sow, he lyes by me the rest of the Night
snorting like a Bear. Sometimes he
Vomits in the Bed; not to say more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, hold, you have said too
much already; and I must tell you <font>Lucy</font> ,
you disparage your self in disparaging your
Husband.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I hope to breath, I had as good
have a Broom staff to my Bedfellow as
such a Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And do not you Scold when he
comes home thus?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, and reason good, I think; he
finds I want no Tongue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what does he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, at first, he answer'd me
again in the same manner, thinking, I
suppose, to Silence me with high Words and
Rhodomontades.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And did all this stir never end in
blows?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Once we were both so well heated,
that we were just ready to fall to't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do I hear!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He flourish'd his Cane, and huff'd
after a very tearing rate.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you fear?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all: I snatch'd up a 
Buffet-Stool for my defence, and had he touch'd
me with one finger, he shou'd have found
I wanted not hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A pretty kind of New-fashion
Shield, had you had but your Distaff
instead of a Launce --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He shou'd have found me a very
Amazon.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas, alas, my <font>Lucy</font> , this is not
the way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What way wou'd you have me
take with him? If he respects me not as a
Wife, neither will I respect him as a
Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But St. <font>Paul</font> Teaches, That Wives
ought to be subject to their Husbands with
all reverence: And St. <font>Peter</font> proposes to
our imitation the Example of <font>Sarah</font> , who
call'd her Husband Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know all this; and besides that,
the same <font>Paul</font> commands, That Husbands
love their Wives, as Christ loved his Church.
Let him remember his Duty, and I will
not forget mine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But where Affairs are in that
posture that both cannot Rule, 'tis fit that
the Wife yield to the Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But how can he be call'd a
Husband, who regards me only as a
Servant?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tell me, <font>Lucy</font> , did he then
forbear striking?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he forbore; and he did
wisely, otherwise he had been soundly beaten.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But you, I warrant, did not
forbear Scolding.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may swear it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he in the mean time?
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sometime he seem'd to sleep
Dogs-sleep, sometimes he wou'd laugh and
neglect me; then he wou'd take up an old
rotten Lute, on which there was hardly
left three whole strings, yet he wou'd Fum,
fum, on that damn'd Instrument, only to
drown my noise.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This enraged you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So far <font>Amy</font> , that I can hardly
express my Passion; much ado had I to hold
my hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My dear <font>Lucy</font> , will you permit me
to speak freely to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most willingly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall have the same liberty
with me. And thus much seems due to our
old friendship, which was first contracted,
as I may say, in our very Cradle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, <font>Amy</font> ; nor is there any of
my Acquaintance more dear to me than
your self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must know then, that
whatsoever your Husband proves, there is no
means of changing. Of Old, indeed,
there was a thing in use, for a Remedy
in this case, call'd a Divorce; but
Authority hath Abrogated that Custom. There
is now no Remedy, but that you must be
his, and he yours, during Life.
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Our Superiors did ill to remove
that good Law of Separation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, forbear such expressions, it
was Christ's Will and Pleasure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot think it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis so; there remains therefore
nothing now, but that both Parties
endeavour a mutual Peace and Concord, and
that they strive which shall conform most
to each others Humour and Inclination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But may not I endeavour to make
and mold him as I see fitting?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not what you call making
and molding; but of this I am confident,
that most Husbands, how bad so ever they
are, owe much of the occasion to their
Wives.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seems all goes well between you
and yours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The very heighth of Peace and
Quiet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But was it always in the same
calm from the beginning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We never had what I may call a
Storm! 'Tis true, some little Clouds (such
as are natural to all Mankind) might,
perhaps, sometimes gather, and seem to
threaten foul Weather, unless prevented
by discretion. Every Man hath his
peculiar humour and fancy: And in truth,
<pagebreak id="10" />
<font>Lucy</font> , every Woman hath her peculiar
Deserts; which things ought always,
especially in Matrimony, to be known and
observed, but not hated.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are in the right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It happens frequently, that
Affection decays between Husband and Wife
before they sufficiently know one another:
Have a care therefore in the beginning, for
Conjugal Love being once shatter'd, is
hardly ever well united again, especially
where there have been bitter Reproaches
between them; where things are but new
glued together they are easily disjointed,
but if you let them fix till the Glue be well
dried, they become as strong as if all of
a piece. Nothing therefore ought to be
omitted between the new Marry'd in the
beginning, that so their actual kindness
may the better fix and settle; and this
ought chiefly to be sought by obsequious
and complacent Endearments, for that
Affection which depends only on Beauty
is seldom lasting.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tell me, I beseech you, by
what unknown Arts have you wrought
over your Husband to so much
Complacency.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tell you, that you may use
the same method.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I am able.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is no difficulty, if you are
but willing, neither is it too late, you are
both young enough; and if I am rightly
inform'd, it is less than a Year since ye were
Marry'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis very true.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tell you therefore, but you
must mind me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most attentively.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My principal Care was to appear
to my Husband always in a good humour,
that so I might give him no occasion of
disquiet; I observ'd his Affections and
Inclinations; I observ'd proper times, and
methods, by which he was most apt to be
appeas'd, or offended; just as those do
who reclaim your Elephants, and Lions,
and such like Creatures, which are not to
be overcome with force.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Even such a Beast have I at home
to deal with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Men appear not before Elephants
in White, nor before Bulls in Red, in
regard these Colours have been observed to
exasperate those Creatures, just as the
sound of a Timbrel or Drum is said to
enrage the Tiger, so far as that he will tear
his own Flesh for madness. So those that
manage Horses, they speak them fair, they
<pagebreak id="12" />
smack their Mouths, they stroke them, and
clap their Necks; and by such means, they
become as gentle as a Lamb. How much
rather ought we to observe these Arts
towards our Husbands, to whose constant
Society, both at Bed and Board, we are
fatally obliged for our whole Life?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These things premised; I
conform'd my self to him, shunning all
occasions of offence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As how?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> First, in the Affairs of the Family,
(which is indeed the pecular Province of a 
Wife) I not only took care that nothing
should be wanting, but that all things
might be to his humour, even in the most
criminal Matters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name some.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For Example: Suppose he loves
this or that Dish more than other, or his
Diet thus or thus order'd, or his Bed
made or furnish'd after this or that
manner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But how could you behave your
self to such a Husband who is never at
home, unless Drunk?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Permit me and I'll tell you. If my
Husband appear out of humour, I observe
the time; I neither laugh nor jest, as is
<pagebreak id="13" />
the indiscreet Custom of some Wives, but
put on a Countenance suitable to his, very
serious and grave. A good Glass
represents her Face exactly who looks in it, so
shou'd a good Wife that of her Husband,
when affected either with Joy or Sorrow;
when he is sad, she ought not to appear
pleased, or laugh when he laments. When
he is angry, she ought either to sweeten
him with soft Language, or in Silence
submit to his Passion, till she find a more
proper opportunity either to vindicate her
self, or to admonish him. Thus did I, if at
any time my Husband came home in Drink;
I used no Language but what was pleasant,
and forced him to Bed with all the little
Tricks of Love and Fondness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Unhappy is the condition of us
Wives, if we must thus submit to all the
Extravagancies of Cholerick and Drunken
Husbands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As if the Sufferance were not
Mutual: Come, come, <font>Lucy</font> , Wives have
many faults which Husbands are compell'd to
bear with; yet there's a time, when, in a
serious manner, a Wife may Lawfully
advise her Husband, if the occasion be of
weight, but if it be about a Trifle, she
ought not to contest it.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, proceed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus, when she finds his Mind at
liberty, neither Troubled, nor Pensive, nor
Drunk, then is the time, in private, and
with obliging Language, to advise, or
rather intreat him, that in this or that
particular he wou'd more consider his Estate,
Health, or Reputation. Yet, as I said, this
Admonition must be deliver'd in a pleasant
and obliging manner, or else it will do
more harm than silence. I have used
sometimes to make a long Apology by way
of Preface, that he wou'd not be offended,
if I, Silly Woman as I am, think my self
concern'd for his Honour, Health, or good
Condition. At other times, when in few
words I had advis'd him of such things as
I thought convenient, I have immediately,
of my own accord, broke off the Discourse,
and found out a more pleasing Subject.
It is almost a general fault in our Sex, my
<font>Lucy</font> , that when we have once begun to
speak of any thing, we can never tell
when to give over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Men say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, above all things, I give you
this Caution, That you never contest with
your Husband before Company, and that
you never complain abroad of what's done
at home; the Breach that happens between
<pagebreak id="15" />
two without Witness, is not hard to be
composed, but in case any thing shou'd
happen of such nature, that the Wife can
neither endure with patience, nor prevent
by all her intreaties, Civility requires that
she complains to the Parents or Relations
of her Husband, rather than to her own,
and that in such a modest temper of
Language, that it may appear she is only
displeas'd at her Husbands Vice, and not his
Person. Nor wou'd I have her discover all
for by this means her very Husband will
candidly acknowledge, and love her
Civility.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Wife that can do this, <font>Amy</font> ,
must be a perfect Philosopher, a very
Stoick in her Passions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By such Behaviour, we win our
Husbands to the like Civility and
Complaisance for us.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But there are some Men whom no
good Offices can oblige.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not of your Opinion. But
suppose there be, consider thus: Your
Husband, be he what he will, yet he is
your Husband, and you are tyed to him
for Life; it is therefore much more
tolerable to endure his humour, such as it is,
or by fair means to render it something
more easie, than by ill Language to make
<pagebreak id="16" />
him worse. What say you, if I produce
Examples of some Husbands who have
used this method in reclaiming their Wives?
How much more convenient is it then, for
us to observe towards our Husbands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You will produce an Instance of a
quite different Nature from my Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is a Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, one of singular Learning, and
very accomplish'd Parts, who not many
years since marry'd a handsom young Girl
of about Sixteen years of Age: She had
been constantly Educated at home in the
Country, where you know the Gentry
delight most to abide for the conveniency of
Hunting or Hawking. He had always
desired a Wife of that condition,
Untaught and Innocent, that so he might with
less difficulty form her to his own humour.
They were no sooner Marry'd, but he
began to Instruct her in Grammar, Musick,
and such like Arts, that might be of future
advantage. These things were new to her,
who having been bred at Ease, and
unacquainted with all Conversation or
Divertisements, but what she had been used to
among her Fathers Servants, found her self
quickly tired with her Husband's
Documents. She began to be stubborn, and
when he urged her to her Duty, she wou'd
<pagebreak id="17" />
weep bitterly, and take on in such an
extravagant manner, that sometimes she
wou'd cast her self on the ground, as
impatient of Life. When her Husband saw
there was no end of this unreasonable
Behaviour, dissembling however his disgust, he
invites her to accompany him to her
Fathers in the Country, for the
Divertisements of a Summers Journey. This
motion was very grateful to her; being
arriv'd there, he Rides out one Morning to
Hunt with the Father, leaving his Wife at
Home with her Mother and Sisters.
Being in the Field, he draws the Father from
the other Company, and complaining,
tells him, That he hoped to have found in
his Daughter no small Comfort and Ease to
the remaining part of his Life, but that he
had found her, much against his
expectation, continually in Tears, always
Discontented and discontenting him, and Deaf
to his Advice; he desires him therefore, to
use his Authority toward the Reformation
of her untractable Humour. The Father
replies, That he had given up his Daughter
wholly to his Government, and that if he
found his Words ineffectual, he shou'd use
what other means he pleased, and reduce
her by force. I know my Power, and
what I may do, says the Son-in-Law, but
<pagebreak id="18" />
I am unwilling to use such extremity to one
that I love so tenderly as I do your
Daughter; I desire rather that she should
understand her Duty from your Perswasions, and
the Authority of a Parent. Within two or
three days after this, the Father finds his
Daughter alone, and, with many frowns,
begins with reminding her how, that she
having so little Beauty of either Mind or
Body to recommend her, that he often
had dispair'd of ever getting her a
Husband; that having now procured her such
an Invidious Match, and made her happy
with much Industry, yet she, not
considering what he had done for her, nor the
value of such a Husband, who, had he not
been of a wonderful good Nature, would
hardly have received her into the number
of his Servants; and she to Rebel thus!
In short, he seem'd so moved, that he
hardly forbore striking: For you must
know, this Father was a Man of such a
ready Wit, and such quick Parts, that he
would Personate any Character or Passion
as he pleas'd. The Daughter hereupon, 
partly overcome with Fear, and partly
with a true sence of her own Guilt, casts
her self at her Fathers Knees, begs his
Pardon for the past, and assures him of her
future Duty; on those Conditions he
Pardons, and Promises his Affection.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but how was this perform'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Girl being parted from her
Father, returns to her Husbands
Chamber, where finding him alone, she falls at
his feet, with these expressions: <font>Sir, I have
not hitherto known either you or my self as I
ought, but for the future you shall see me nothing
less than what I have been; I beg you would
forget my past Behaviour</font> . At these words
the Husband rais'd her with a Kiss, and
promis'd mighty Matters on her
amendment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And did she alter her Behaviour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never was any Woman more
humble all the following part of her Life;
there was nothing her Husband cou'd
desire, but she flew to obey him with the
greatest alacrity imaginable: So great,
and so intire, was their Affection from that
time. Within a few years after this, she
freely acknowledged her self infinitely
Happy in such a Husband; and that
without him, she had been the most wretched
of Women.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Such Husbands as this, are as rare
as Black Swans or White Crows.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you now another passage,
which happen'd but lately in this City --
But I fear you are tir'd with this Subject.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, not at all: Your Discourse,
my dear <font>Amy</font> , can never tire the Hearer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Away, away, you Railly -- 
There is a Person of no mean Quality, but
he shall be Nameless, who being much
addicted to Hunting, as most are of his
condition, met accidentally, one day, with
a Country Girl of Exquisite Beauty, which,
by the Poverty of her Mother, was not at
all diminish'd. The Jolly Hunter fell
desperately in love at the first sight, he
frequented those Parts continually on the
account of this Passion, tho' his pretence
was Hunting. His Wife, a Lady of
singular Virtue and Discretion, suspecting
something, without much difficulty found
out the Intrigue. She takes occasion to
see the House, she views their Beds, tasts
their Drink, enquires into their Diet, and
finds nothing of Furniture, nothing of
Conveniency, but all signs of a miserable
Penury and Want. She returns home, and the
next day brings with her an excellent Silk
Quilt, a Treat of Sweet-Meats, 
Drinking-Plate, and Silver Dishes; these she left at
the Country Cottage, with some Money,
requesting the Old Woman, that whenever
the Gentleman came, she should Treat
him with more Ceremony, dissembling her
self, in the mean time, to be his Sister, and
<pagebreak id="21" />
not his Wife. Some few days after this, the
Husband gives his Country Mistress a Stoln
Visit; he is amazed to see the Poor Hovel
furnish'd after so unusual a manner, and
so many rich Moveables in every Corner.
He inquires the surprizing Cause, and is
told, That a certain Lady of Quality, a
Relation of his, but whose Name they
knew not, had sent them all in, with
Orders to Treat him after a more Honourable
fashion than formerly. He begins to
suspect his Wife had a hand in this, and at his
return questions her upon the Point; she
confesses all. He demands further, How
she came to be so wondrous kind to
Accommodate that House with such
Furniture? My Dear, says she, you having
been always used to Splendid and Noble
Entertainments, and I finding how poorly
you were received there, I thought it my
Duty to take Care, that when you are
minded to make those Visits, they might
be able to give you a Reception more
suitable to your Quality.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! Miracle of a good Wife! Had
I been concern'd, instead of a Quilt I
would have brought him a Truss of Thorns
and Briers to lye on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hear the conclusion: The
Husband discovering, by this Action, such a
<pagebreak id="22" />
sweet and obliging Nature in his Wife, did,
of himself, forbear all his old Debauchery,
and became the most faithful Husband
imaginable. -- I presume you know Sir
<font>Bazill</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He, as you know, being in the
prime flourish of his Youth, Marry'd a
Wife of declining Years.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You mean he Marry'd a good
Estate, not a Wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let it be so then. Soon after the
Marriage, he began to be weary of his
Wife, and fell desperately in love with a
young Beauty of the Town, at whose
Lodgings he frequented continually,
rarely either Eating or Sleeping at Home.
What wou'd you have done in this case?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wou'd have drag'd her by the
Hair about the Streets. And for him, had
I seen him going on such a Visit, I wou'd
have Crown'd his Head with a full
Chamber-Pot; and in that Ornamental Pickle he
shou'd have sought a Mistress.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But his Wife acted more discreetly.
She invites her Rival to her own House;
she receives her in the most obliging
manner imaginable. Thus she procured her
Husbands Company, without any other
Charm than that of seeing his Mistress at
<pagebreak id="23" />
his own House; and in case he shou'd
sometimes Sup with her abroad, his Wife wou'd
not fail to send them some good Treat,
and bid them be Merry.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wou'd sooner dye than be my
Husbands Bawd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You do not consider, <font>Lucy</font> , that this
way is much more secure and easie, than
by injurious Language to exasperate him
still more, and give occasion of a lasting
Quarrel for Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess it the less Evil, but I cou'd
never be able to act with so much
Patience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will give you one Example more,
and I have done with particulars. Our
Neighbour here at the next Door, an
honest good Man as breaths, but a little too
subject to Passion, happen'd t'other day, in
a sudden heat, to strike his Wife, a
Woman of a sweet temper, who, without
delay, retires to her Closet, and there weeps
most bitterly; the only way she used to
vent her Sorrow. It was not long after,
that some occasion or other brought her
Husband thither, who finding her in that
posture, <font>What means</font> (says he) <font>these Baby
tears? leave for shame</font> . Her answer was
prudent and obliging; <font>Your unkindness is of
that nature, that I am forced either to regret it</font>
<pagebreak id="24" />
<font>thus, or (like other Women) in Clamour and
Reproaches: I choose this way, Sir, as most
consistent with your Honour and my own Love</font> .
With these Words she touch'd her Husbands
very Soul, who, in a thousand kind
expressions, made a solemn Promise never to
be guilty in that nature again; nor was 
he.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have often desired thus much of
my Husband for many reasons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet you are still at variance with
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What wou'd you have me do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the first place, consider calmly
with your self the nature of those things
which you complain of, and you will find
you ought not to resent them so heinously,
but rather pass them over in silence; and
be assured, his Mind will, of necessity, be
reform'd by obliging Behaviour; you will
certainly wholly subdue his temper to your
desires, or, at least, you will live much
more comfortably than at present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is so Salvage, that no good
Offices can ever oblige him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, say not so: The wildest
Creatures that are may be reclaim'd by
Endeavours; Dispair not then of any Man.
Try the Experiment but some Months, and
then blame me if you find my Counsel
<pagebreak id="25" />
unsuccessful. There are some faults which
you ought to avoid with more particular
Care: Above all, take especial heed that
you never quarrel in Bed, let all there be
kind and obliging; for if that place, which
is in all Nations esteem'd Sacred to Love
and Pleasure, become profaned with Hate
and Discord, you lose the best means of
renewing lost Affection. There are some
Wives of such unquiet temper, that in the
most ravishing Enjoyment they cannot
forbear to Scold and Wrangle, changing very
Pleasure it self into Wormwood, and by
their implacable Behaviour, corrupting
that good Medicine which is usually the
best Cure for Discontent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess I have done thus
often.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Wife ought, at all times, to avoid
any action that may be unpleasant to her
Husband; but chiefly in Love's softest
Minutes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, to a Husband: But <font>Amy</font> , I
have to do with a very Brute.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie, fie, forbear ill Language;
most bad Husbands, as I said before, owe
much of the occasion to their Wives. But
to proceed: Those who are Vers'd in the
old Poetick Fables, tells us of <font>Venus Cestus</font> ,
which was a Girdle, in which was Quilted,
<pagebreak id="26" />
with abundance of exquisite Art, all that
was powerful in procuring or resorting
Love; and this Girdle she wore
continually when she enjoy'd her Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know the Fable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But know the Moral too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Speak it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We are Taught by this old Tale,
<font>Lucy</font> , that a Wife ought to employ all her
Faculties most assiduously to oblige her
Husband in Bed, by which means she will
infallibly heal all breaches, or decays of
Conjugal Affection, and expel all Clouds
of Neglect or Displeasure that may be
gathering in his thoughts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But where can we poor Women
procure this Divine <font>Castus</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You need not Conjure for it. There
are no Charms requisite to obtain it, but
only those of Behaviour, and a sweet
obliging Temper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis impossible for me to comply
with such a Husband as I am Curs'd with.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis your own fault that he is such.
Suppose it were in your power (as they say
of <font>Circe</font> ) to transform your Husband to a
Brawn or Bear, wou'd you do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a hard Question: I know not
what to answer.
<pagebreak id="27" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How! Not know? What, had 
you rather have a Brawn for your
Bedfellow than a Man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No sure; I'd rather have a Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But suppose further, that you were
able, by some <font>Circaean</font> Art, or otherwise,
to reform your Husband from a Drunkard
to a Man of Morals, from a profuse
Prodigal to a Purchaser, and from an idle
Drone to an industrious Bee, wou'd you
not do it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Undoubtedly I wou'd: But who
will teach me these Arts?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You need no Teacher, the Art is
yours already, you only want a Will to
use it. Never think whether you shou'd
respect your Husband as such, he is such
whether you will or not; but how to make 
him better, that shou'd employ your
thoughts. They say all things have two
Handles: You regard only your Husbands
faults and imperfections, which your own
aversion does continually aggravate; by
this Handle you always take him up, but
thus you can never hold him. View
rather, and consider his Accomplishments
and Virtues, by this Handle you may hold
him fast; thus, if you take him, he's
your own for ever, the proper time to
search into his faults, had been before you
Married.
<pagebreak id="28" />
-- <font>Had you been wise,
You had chose your Husband from your Ears, not Eyes.</font>
'Tis now too late to accuse his faults, but
not too late to cure them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Woman ever Married, or
chose a Husband by her Ears, I wonder?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She Marries by her Eyes, who
takes a Man only for Shape and Beauty;
but she who guides her love by what she
hears of his good Name and Reputation,
chooses a Husband by her Ears, and acts
much more discreetly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You advise well; but 'tis too late,
<font>Amy</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all too late to endeavour to
mend a bad Husband; I wish you had a
Child by him, that wou'd conduce much
to make up the breach.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have a Child.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How! a Child! Since when?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Long enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee how old?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Almost seven Months.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why this is wonderful; do you
breed Children in three Months time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No. Why?
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must of necessity, if we
compute the time from your Wedding.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's true. -- But -- you must
know, I had had some Discourse with him
before we Marry'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Discourse, <font>Lucy</font> ! I never knew
before that Children were got by
Discoursing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you all. During our time
of Wooing, he happen'd one day to find
me alone in my Chamber, where, not
dreaming of his Visit, I had set my self
close to Work on my Bed-side; he seeing 
the opportunity fair, began to play the
Rogue, and tickle me, in a jesting
manner. Now you must know, I am extream
ticklish, and not being able to endure his
Fingers, I fell all along as in an extasie;
he, it seems, pursued his point, and almost
smothered me with Kisses. What he did
beside I do not well know, but I'm sure
that soon after I found a great alteration,
a thousand Qualmes, and all the signs of a
breeding Woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very famous History! But how
can you, <font>Lucy</font> , find in your heart to hate
that Man, who can get you with Child in
a jesting manner? What cou'd he do think
you, when he applies himself to Work in
earnest?
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I'm with Child again
already.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Brave, I protest! You see a good
Plowman, and a rich apt Soil, make a
quick Harvest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay, he performs this way
better than I desire.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Few Wives are of your Mind.
But tell me one thing more, is the
Conjugal Debt duly paid at present?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I have stopp'd all Payments.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is the less then to be blamed
for Rambling. Is your Child Male or
Female?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A delicate Boy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Boy ought to make you
Friends; and it will be effected
undoubtedly, if you wou'd but yield a little.
What do other People say of your
Husband? What Character has he abroad?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is reported abroad to be of a
most obliging Behaviour, kind, liberal,
and an excellent Friend to those that love
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus far there's hope: I see he is
without Door what you cou'd wish him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But to me only he is quite
otherwise.
<pagebreak id="31" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> However, be you such to him
as I advised, and if you do not find
him become the same Man to you
too, never give me credit. Your
Husband is but young, (I guess him
about four and twenty) he cannot
yet know well what it is to be a
House-keeper, and all the Duties that
belong to that Name. Think thus,
<font>Lucy</font> , and do not think of
Separation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot forbear it, my Life
is so uneasie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis impossible you shou'd
desire it, if you wou'd but rightly
consider what a wretched Creature a
Wife is when parted from her
Husband, and how Excellent her
Character who Loves and Obeys.
Nature requires, and God commands,
that the Wife depend wholly on her
Husband. Be assured, a Husband is
just like an Estate; you have both
one, and if you lose that, you must
starve, or live without any. In the
last place, think of your poor Child,
<pagebreak id="32" />
the Common Interest of both his
Parents. How wou'd you dispose
of him? Wou'd you take him with
you? Then you dispossess and rob
his Father. Wou'd you leave him
behind you? Then I know you
relinquish the dearest Treasure you
have. Pray answer me one
Question; have you any back Friends,
that wou'd rejoyce to see you
miserable?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, some. I have a true
Mother-in-Law for one; and to
match her, there is my Husbands
Mother as very a Devil as her
self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are they very malicious?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe they have wish'd
me ruin'd a thousand times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And wou'd you gratify their
Malice? You do it abundantly in a
Separation. What thing can be 
more pleasing to them than to see
you live forsaken; a Widow: Nay,
worse than a Widow; for Widows
may Love, and Marry again where
<pagebreak id="33" />
they fancy, which you can never
hope for.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I approve your Counsel, my
dear <font>Amy</font> , and wou'd practise it, but
I am discourag'd to think of such a
tedious labour.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have a pretty Parrot
here, that speaks some Words
exceeding plain; have you been long
in teaching him?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord, aye; the Bird has
cost me a World of Pains and
Patience.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And can you think the
undertaking tedious, when you
endeavour to reclaim a Husband, in whose
Society you may spend your whole
Life with Pleasure? Can you take
pains to teach a Parrot, and not
endeavour to win a Husband by kind
Language? What pains do some Men
take to break a Horse, and make
<pagebreak id="34" />
him easie? Be assured, <font>Lucy</font> , it
deserves more pains to make your
Husband kind.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What wou'd you have me
do?

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell you in few Words.
Take care that all things within
Doors be neat, and in good order,
that so he may not be Sick of Home.
Let your Behaviour be affable and
familiar, yet always within the
limits of that Reverend esteem you
owe a Husband. Be neither too sad,
nor airy; neither too Coy, nor
Wanton. Let his Diet be Choice, and
well Dress'd. Observe what he likes
best, and provide that often.
Observe what Company he most
favours, and Invite them continually;
Treat them, and Oblige them often.
Let all such Entertainments be
gentile and pleasant, nothing to be then
wanting; but least of all, Mirth and
good Humour. And when at any
<pagebreak id="35" />
time you find him Merry with a
Glass too much, or so, if he begins
to Tune his Lute, be you also ready
with your Voice, to make a
Consort. Thus, by degrees, you will
teach him to delight to be at Home,
and consequently, to avoid a World
of needless Expences; for he must of
necessity, in a short time, consider
thus: <font>Am not I a Mad-man to be so
often abroad, Debauching away both
my Estate and Reputation, among a
Company of rotten Whores, filthy
Creatures, equally unsound in Mind and
Body, when I have here at Home a
Wife of such a temper, so infinitely
beyond them all for Beauty, Youth, and
Wit; and what is more considerable, a
faithful Wife, and one that loves me
so entirely, and in whose Company I
can enjoy what delights I please,
without Scandal or Hazard</font> ?
<pagebreak id="36" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, suppose I shou'd act
thus as you Advise, yet I fear
Success.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Trust to me: I'll take it
upon my self if you fail. In the mean
time, I'll go and begin with him;
I'll teach him his Duty too.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Am.</font> </comment> I love you for that; but 
for
God's sake, take heed our
Consultation be not discovered. If he shou'd
smoak us, he'd run into all the
Extravagancies of <font>Bedlam</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Am.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fear not that, you shall see I
will manage my Words with such
Cunning, that himself shall begin
the Discourse, and tell me all your
Discords: Then will I handle him
in such a manner, and use such
Arguments, that I doubt not but to
leave him in a better humour for
your advantage than I found him.
I will only mention you by the by,
<pagebreak id="37" />
as one that I hear loves him with a
perfect Affection.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Luc.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prosper th'Event sweet
