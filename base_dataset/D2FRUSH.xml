and am out of seruice, and faine would haue a Maister. And
Sir if it please you to haue me, I shall doe you diligent seruice,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then within foure or fiue dayes after, it fortuned that the
Priour came into the Kitchin, and there he found the young
man, to whom he said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> where wast thou borne, and what is
thy name? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The young man answered and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I was
borne very farre hence, and <font>Rush</font> is my name. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said the
Priour vnto him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rush</font> , canst thou couple Hounds together?
Yea Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech> (said <font>Rush</font> ) </nonSpeech><dialogue> that I can doe right well, and more   
then
that, for I can couple men and women together, which is a
more mastrie, and also Sir (if neede be) I can conuay a faire
woman into your chamber, and conuay her home againe in
the morning so secretly, that no man shall spye it. And also
I shall keepe your counsaile so secretly, that it shall neuer be
knowne. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And when the Priour heard <font>Rush</font> speake so, he was
right glad of him, and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rush</font> , if thou canst doe as thou
hast said? I shall reward thee well for thy labour, and thou
shalt be my most welbeloued seruant: wherefore make an end
<pagebreak id="A3V" />
of thy businesse, for soone, thou shalt goe a little way on a
message for me, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so he departed and went to supper. And when
euery man had supped, and <font>Rush</font> had done all his businesse in
the Kitchin, hee came vnto his maister the Priour, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir, what is your will with me? </dialogue><nonSpeech>the Priour answered and
said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> here a little beside dwelleth a faire Gentlewoman, the
the which I loue very well, but I dare not discouer my minde
vnto her my selfe: and if thou canst finde the meanes to bring
her secretly vnto me, I shall reward thee right well for thy
labour and paine. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And when <font>Rush</font> had heard the words of his
Maister, and knew all his minde, he answered and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir,
be of good cheere, and let mee alone with that matter: for I
shall goe vnto the Gentlewomans house, and I shall say your
message so well, that this night she shall come to you: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so
departed <font>Rush</font> from his Maister, and went straight vnto this
Gentlewomans house. And when he was thither come, hee
found the Gentlewoman sitting all alone. And when <font>Rush</font>
was espied of her, he made vnto her great courtesie, and with
many reuerences these words he said.</nonSpeech>

 <head>HOW A DEUILL NAMED <font>RUSH</font> CAME VNTO A GENTLEWOMANS HOUSE,
AND HOW HE BROUGHT HER PRIUILY VNTO HIS
MAISTERS CHAMBER.</head> <dialogue>

   Rest you merry faire Mistresse, the most fairest creature
in the world. My Maister greeteth you by me, desiring
you to come and speake with him. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then said the 
Gentlewoman to <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> who is your Maister, and what is his     
will with
me? faire Mistresse, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will shew you, my Maister 
is the Priour in a house of Religion here beside, and he loueth
you so well except that you come vnto him this night, I know
he will be dead for sorrow.

</dialogue> <head>HERE FOLLOWETH THE ANSWERE OF THE GENTLEWOMAN.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>And when the Gentlewoman had heard the words of
<font>Rush</font> , shee answered and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Faire Sir, it were great
<pagebreak id="A4R" />
pittie that the Gentleman should die for my sake, and rather
then he should so doe for me, I will come to him, and shew him
all the courtesie that I can. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rush</font> was very glad of those
comfortable words, and thought that his enterprise was well
brought to passe, and he said vnto her:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Faire Mistresse, may
it please you to take the labour and goe with me, and I shall
bring you to my
Master, and as I 
suppose, hee will make
you good cheare, and
Gold and Siluer you
shall lacke none, for
hee hath great plenty
thereof. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then saide
the Gentlewoman,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Sir, I pray you let
vs depart hence: for 
as I suppose the
Gentleman looketh
long for vs. </dialogue><nonSpeech>So foorth
they went both 
together, till they came to

Chamber.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">THE OTHER FRIARS SOON ASKED RUSH TO HELP THEM IN THE SAME
WAY AS HE HAD HELPED THE PRIOR, WHICH HE DID. ALL WERE 
EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO RUSH, AND NONE GUESSED THAT HE WAS

<pagebreak id="A4V" />
</dialogue> <head>HOW FRIER <font>RUSH</font> THREW THE MAISTER COOKE INTO A KETTELL
OF WATER SEETHING VPON THE FIRE,
WHEREIN HE DIED.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>It befell vpon a day that <font>Rush</font> went forth to sport him, and
it was very late ere he came home againe, and the maister
Cooke was very angry with him that hee was so long absent.
And as soone as <font>Rush</font> was entred into the Kitchin: the Cooke
began to chide, and said vnto him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> thou horson knaue where
hast thou beene so long: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and with a great staffe hee laid vpon
<font>Rush</font> and beat him sore. And when <font>Rush</font> saw that the Cooke
was angry, and so farre out of reason, and that he had beaten
him sore: anon he began to waxe very angry with the maister
Cooke, and said vnto him:</nonSpeech><dialogue> thou horson villaine, why hast thou
beaten me thus: I will be reuenged on thee: </dialogue><nonSpeech>and suddainly he
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
caught him in his armes, and threw him into a great kettell
which was full of water seething vpon the fire, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> lye
thou there in the Diuels name: for now thou shalt neither
fight nor chide no more with me: <omission type="sentence" />
<comment type="compiler">RUSH THEN WENT TO COLLECT THE PRIOR'S MISTRESS. ON HIS RETURN, 
HE LEARNED THAT THE COOK'S BODY HAD BEEN DISCOVERED; EVERYONE  
HAD ASSUMED THAT THE COOK HAD DROWNED HIMSELF, AND RUSH WAS NOW 
THE NEW MASTER COOK.</comment>
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then 
it fortuned vpon a day the Priour and his brethren were
assembled together in a generall counsaile, and as they stood
talking together, the Priour remembred <font>Rush</font> , and anon he said
vnto his brethren:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Friends we haue here <font>Rush</font> which is our
maister Cooke in our Kithin, and he is an olde seruant, and
much diligent and true seruice he hath done to vs, and he hath
continued among vs longer then any seruant that euer wee
had: wherefore me thinke it reason, that hee were promoted
vnto some other office, and made a brother among vs. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then
all the whole couent with one voice said they were content it
should so be. So the Priour sent for <font>Rush</font> , and when he was
come before him and all his brethren, the Priour said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rush</font> it
is so, thou hast beene here a long season and we haue found thee
hitherto a true and diligent seruant, wherefore wee will that
thou be promoted, and take vpon thee an habite as we haue,
and to become a brother among vs. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rush</font> answered and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
my Maisters I thanke you all, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and then the Priour gaue <font>Rush</font>
an habite, and put it on his backe, and so <font>Rush</font> became a
brother in the place, neuerthelesse he kept his office still.</nonSpeech>

 <head>HOW FRIER <font>RUSH</font> MADE TRUNCHEONS FOR THE FRIERS
TO FIGHT WITHALL.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>When <font>Rush</font> had on the habite of a Frier, and was a
brother in the place, he had more vacation dayes then
he had before. And as a King or a great Prince prepareth 
ordinances against their warres, in likewise did Frier <font>Rush</font> :
for when all his businesse was done in the Kitchin, and that he
had leysure, he went and sate in the Port of the vtter gate, and
there he was making of good bigge Truncheons of Oke. And
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
he made them with Hilts ouer the hand for slipping, at the
which the other Friers had great meruaile, &amp; demanded of him
wherefore he made those Truncheons. <font>Rush</font> answered and
said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Faire Sirs, I make them for this intent: that if there
come any theeues hither for to rob vs, and to spoile our place,
yet shall we haue weapons to defend vs withall. And
therefore I make them. And moreouer, when any neede shall be,
come to mee and euery man shall haue one, and they shall be
ready at your commandement, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and then the Friers thanked
him and so departed.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, A QUARREL BETWEEN THE PRIOR AND SUBPRIOR 
SPILLED OVER INTO VIOLENCE DURING MIDNIGHT MASS. WHEN RUSH SAW 
THAT ALL THE OTHER FRIARS WERE JOINING IN, HE BLEW OUT THE CANDLES
AND THEN SECRETLY SET ABOUT THEM.</comment>
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then when the fray
was done, and all the noyse seased, <font>Rush</font> came in among them
with a Candell light in his hand, and made as he had knowne
nothing thereof, and said to them:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Fie for shame Sirs, how
fortuned this discord to fall among your selues? I see well
now you regard not your honour, nor the good name of your
place. All the people shall say ye be not honest, nor good 
religious men, the which words I would be loath to heare, and I
may not suffer our place so to fall in an euill name: 
wherefore good Masters, I require you to set your hearts at rest, and
put the matter into my hands, and I shall doe so much that all
shall be well, and you shal be good friends againe, and no words
shall be spoken thereof, </dialogue><nonSpeech>then euery man complained to him of
their great hurt, and he made semblance as he had beene sorie
therefore and then they that could goe, went vp to their Sels,
and they that could not goe, did creepe vp as well as they could,
and laid them downe <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: dnwne</comment> in their beds, and there  
they lay till they
were whole againe, and in the space of three weekes and more,
God was euill serued, for in all that space they sung neither
Mattins nor Euensong, nor neuer entred into the Church for
it was suspended, and for shame they durst neuer let it be
knowne. And when they were all whole, and euery man vpon
his feete againe, and might goe about the house, they brought
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
againe their staues to Frier Rush, and thanked him much, and
then Frier <font>Rush</font> said vnto them:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirs when ye haue neede of
them againe, ye shall finde them here ready at your
commandement, </dialogue><nonSpeech>for which they gaue him thankes, and departed.</nonSpeech><dialogue>

</dialogue> <head>HOW FRIER <font>RUSH</font> GRYMED THE WAGGON WITH TARRE, AND
WHAT CHEARE HE MADE IN THE COUNTRY.</head> 

   <nonSpeech>Another time it fortuned that the Priour had a iourney
to ride into the Country about a little businesse that hee
had there to doe, and anon he called <font>Rush</font> his seruant vnto him
and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Rush</font> goe thy way into the Court, and take with
thee a dish full of greace, and greace well the wheeles and
Axeltrees of the Waggon, and make all things ready against
to morrow in the morning, for I must ride forth to morrow
betimes, </dialogue><nonSpeech>then <font>Rush</font> departed from his Maister, and went
about his businesse, and in steed of greace, hee tooke a great
vessell full of Tarre, and anointed the Waggon all ouer with
it, both within and without, and especially in the place where
the Priour should sit: and when he had done, he returned to
his Maisters chamber, then the Priour demanded of <font>Rush</font> , if
he had done as he commanded him:</nonSpeech><dialogue> yea Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> ye may
ride when please you, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so they went to their beds. Then
on the morrow after, the Priour and <font>Rush</font> his seruant with
his other company, rose vp very early in the morning for to
accomplish their iourney, and forth they went vnto their
Waggon. and when the Priour was entred therein, hee perceiued
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
himselfe all to berayed and smeyred, and all his clothes were
filed therewith: and then he said to <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> thou lewd fellow,
what hast thou done to this Waggon that I am thus arayed
therein? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Rush</font> answered and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I haue done nothing
but as you commanded me. That is not so </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Priour,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
for I commaunded thee to take greace and grease but the
wheeles and the Axeltrees, and thou hast taken Tarre and
annointed it all ouer, both within and without. Why hast thou
done so? Sir </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I vnderstoode you bad me doe so.

when that was gone, they called for another: and then they
called for the third, and so ended their supper. Then on the
morrow when the Priour had done all his businesse, and was
ready to returne home againe: he called for a reckoning. And
anon, the good wife came in and gaue him a reckoning of all
things, both horse meate and mans meate; and at last, she
reckoned three pottels of wine that <font>Rush</font> and his fellowes had.
And when the Priour heard that his seruants had drunke so
much wine: Anon he began to waxe very angry, and asked
her, who commanded her to fill in so much wine? the wife 
answered and said:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, <font>Rush</font> your seruant commaunded me to
fill it in, and he said, that you should pay therefore. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then anon
the Priour called for <font>Rush</font> , and said vnto him:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou lewd
Knaue, why hast thou drunke so much wine? Might no lesse
then pottels serue thee and thy fellowes? Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> we
haue not drunke so much, for your horses hath had two of the
pottels. My horses, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the Priour:</nonSpeech><dialogue> what should they doe
with wine? Yes Sir, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said <font>Rush</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> your horses laboured sorer
than we did, and were very weary, and they had nothing but
Hay and Oates: wherefore, me thought it needefull to giue
them some good drinke to their course meate to comfort their

the better courage to bring you homeward. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And when the
Priour had heard that answere of <font>Rush</font> , and saw there was

   <nonSpeech>When the Prior was come home, hee made Frier Rush 
Sexton of the church, and his office was to ring the
bell and to light the candles, and to cal the Friers to Mattins
at mid-night, and also the Prior commaunded Rush &amp; charged
him, that he should take good heede that there were none of the

in the fieldes to seeke a Cowe which I haue missed this foure
or fiue dayes, and so long I wandered abroad, till at the last
I founde the one halfe of my Cowe, but the other halfe was
gone; and as I woulde haue returned home againe, I was
benighted, so sore that I lost my waye: then I wist not 
whether to goe, but spying a hollowe Tree, I sate me downe, 
thinking there to take my rest till the day appered againe: and I
had not sitten there but a while, but instantly there was
assembled a great company of Deuills which made a 
maruailous great noise, whereof I was sore afrayd. They had
among them a great master named <font>Lucifer</font> . who called all the 
rest to make a reckoning of all their seruice they had done,
since they departed out of Hell: there I heard many 
marueilous tales. At the last, foorth came Frier <font>Rush</font> , then     
saide the
great master <font>Lucifer</font> vnto him, <font>Rush</font> , what hast thou done
since thou departed out of Hell? and he answered, that he had
ruled you, and all your Couent, and caused you, to chide and
fight, and were neuer in vnitie and peace among your selues:
and he said he had caused you to liue viciously, and yet he saide
<pagebreak id="D1V" />
he would doe more ere he departed out of this place, for
he will cause you to kill each other, and then you should be
