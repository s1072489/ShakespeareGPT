 <head>A DIALOGUE
BETWIXT THREE TRAVELLERS,
AS ACCIDENTALLY THEY DID MEET ON THE
HIGH-WAY, <font>CRUCY CRINGE</font> , A PAPIST,
<font>ACCEPTED WEIGHALL</font> , A PROFESSOUR OF THE
CHURCH OF <font>ENGLAND</font> , AND <font>FACTIOUS
WREST-WRIT</font> , A BROWNIST.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Well met, well met Master <font>Wrest-Writ</font> , you
are such an eager man; Do you remember,
Sir, the conference we had, when we last
encountred, almost in this very place? Doe
you still pursue your errours with that wilfull heat?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out of my sight, thou Idolater;
prophanesse hangs in a mist about thee, that thou maist
commit thy deeds of darknesse with the Whore of
Babilon with more securenesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not so hasty Master <font>Wrest-Wright</font> , a good
cause should be disputed with good words, and
confirmed with reasons, not with passions.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Down <font>Dagon</font> , down, I hate thee <font>Cringe</font> ;
<pagebreak id="2" />
I hate thee and thy late disputed doctrine of the reall
presence in the Sacrament, worse than the lawne
sleeves of the Prelates, which are but meer rags of
<font>Rome</font> , and fit onely for tinder for the Tinder-box of
<font>Tophet</font> ; but goe to Master <font>Cringe</font> , because society is
the injunction of nature, and good discourse (they say)
doth make a horse that trots seeme to amble, proceed
in your last argument, and I promise you both silence
and attention.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you will be patient I will. The doctrine
then of the reall presence in the Eucharist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Eucharist! I can forbeare the
argument no longer; there is no such word to be read in all
the Scripture.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very frequently, Sir, in the Greek originall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Talk not to me of Greek, I will beleeve
no Greek, it is a language that shall carry no
authority with me; I hope to see Greek and Latine too, ere
it be long, in lesse reputation than they are.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I doe not like this fury, E'en God be with
you, and grant your zeale more knowledge, and your
knowledge more humility.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay but hark you Master <font>Cringe</font> , hark you
one word, - look you here, - Master <font>Accepted 
Weighall</font> : - Come as wisht for.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Accepted.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How have you done this long time? How
doe you Master <font>Crucy</font> ? Sir, I heartily salute you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I returne your salutation with the like
testimony of good will, and true affection: you intervene
an happy Vmpire, we two were e'en a falling out, and
a falling off too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Verily, Master <font>Weighall</font> , the words of
truth being not in his lips, I was about to separate, and
to leave him to the fogs of his superstitious ignorance,
<pagebreak id="3" />
I must beseech you, having so happily met with your
better company, that we may abandon him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Accept.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so Sir, Although I am a Professour of true
and Orthodox Religion, I am not of the separation; I
would be neither a <font>Trojan</font> , not <font>Tyrian</font> ; it fares with
Religion as with Vertue, she must preserve her selfe entire
betwixt two extreames; and the safest way to truth, is the
middle way; I would be neither learnedly superstitious,
nor obstinately ignorant; but to the point which you were
so hot in disputation of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, when last Master <font>Cringe</font> and I        
encountred,
we held a controversie concerning the reall presence in 
the Sacrament, which Master <font>Cringe</font> beleeveth to be truly
corporall, and in adoration bowes unto it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I beleeve the Sacrament to be a greater
mystery then peradventure you conceive it, and not a meere
Love-feast, as idly enough you are pleased to fancy it; I
dare affirme, that the great worke of mans Redemption
is no where more perfectly to be discovered, <font> <foreign>Nec tam 
praesentes alibi cognoscere Divos</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, you are in your Latine, I will have
Latine againe to answer you; I assure you I take it to be a
Commemoration <font> <foreign>per fidem</foreign> </font> , onely in remembrance of our
Saviours sufferings, on whom we feed with the eye of
faith.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That cannot be Master <font>Wrest-Writ</font> , the words
are positive and punctuall, <font>This is my Body</font> , and will admit
of no other interpretation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The words that follow that text doe as plainly
and punctually interpret the words precedent, <font>Doe this in
remembrance of me</font> , which implies a direct absence of the
party; for what needs a remembrance, when the person
is present? and in this I referre my selfe to Master
<font>Weighall</font> . You affirmed besides at our last meeting, that you did
<pagebreak id="4" />
feed in the Sacrament, upon the very body of Christ
indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I feed in the Sacrament on the very Body and
Bloud of Christ, the elements of Bread and Wine, being
transubstantiated into his Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is most horrible impiety. How is this
transubstantiation? when is it begun? when is it finished?
answer me to that, Master <font>Cringe</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Immediately after the words of the
consecration.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That cannot be, for the Metaphysicks (as I
have heard Schollers say) will not allow that the
substance should be altered, and the accidents remaine, that 
the Bread and Wine should be converted into the very
Body and Bloud of Christ; yet the colour and taste of the
Bread and Wine, which are their accidents, should still 
continue; neither will Divinity ever agree, that the Bread,
which after consecration, you say, is turned into the
Body of Christ, should suffer afterwards corruption, and
moulder away, as we see it doth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We feed, I say, in the Sacrament on the very
Body of Christ; but how? not as we feed on butchers
meat bought in the shambles; but it being received with
all reverence, and prepared humility after a divine and
spirituall manner; and whatsoever you are pleased to say to
to the contrary of us, beleeve me, there is no Catholick
but is of the same opinion with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you doe to avoid some dangerous
absurdities which would consequently arise, should you affirme, 
that in a fleshly manner you eat in the Sacrament, the very
flesh of our Saviour; for then by the same argument should
the blessed Virgin, the mother of our Saviour, feed in the
Sacrament, on the flesh of her owne son; and then again,
as often as in the time of Lent you receive the
<pagebreak id="5" />
Communion, you should as often offend against the order of the
Church, which doth command, that there should in Lent
no meat be eaten. Besides, I understand how crosse it is
to reason and Philosophy, that one Body should at one
and the same time move in severall places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wonders are no wonders in wonderfull
subjects; I beleeve as the Church beleeveth, which doth
informe me, that the Body of our Saviour is assisted alwayes
with the Divinity of our Saviour, and in this (as Master
<font>Wrest-Writ</font> did before) I referre my selfe to you Master
<font>Weighall</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my heart, and if we shall continue
in our journey and travell one way together; as in this, so
in all controverted points betwixt us, I shall referre my
selfe to your advice, Master <font>Weighall</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Weighall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have not the desire, nor yet the ability to
goe thorow with so great a taske; but since it is the 
inclination of truth to communicate herselfe, and through all
my life I have made it my labour to enquire her out: I
will, as neare as I can, first state the question aright, and
then determine it. I beleeve we ought not to make our
approaches to the blessed Sacrament, with that 
overweening familiarity, as the sawcy Brownists; nor yet with such
a devout superstition as the abused Papists. That the Bread
and wine in the Sacrament should be transubstantiated
into the Body of Christ, cannot be admitted into the faith
of any sober man, without admitting with it many grosse
and grievous errours; for besides that, it is but a meere
invention of latter times, it is diametrically opposite to
reason and nature; and God himselfe, who oftentimes
doth work above nature, doth never work against it. The
elevation of the Host by the Papists savours of rank
idolatry; and the unmannerly sitting of the Brownists at the
Communion, of irreverence. A decent and humble
<pagebreak id="6" />
posture is most requisite, especially where God is pleased
to communicate himselfe to be really, and more
peculiarly present. It is no lukewarmenesse, no neutrality to keepe
safe between both your errours, but a grounded
knowledge and uprightnesse: And I assure my selfe, if you would
well weigh, with how much safety between both rockes
the Truth doth passe by unship-wrackt, how secure and
cleare shee is discovered, you would then make hast to
disembogue, and make up unto her, who indeed is the
Center of all sublunary happinesse, where alone we may
finde peace with confidence. Errours in the Church result
out of too unruly an heat, or too thick and too grave a 
Superstition; either while we violently are lead by our own
ungoverned humours, or while blinded with pompe, or
with the shadowes of Antiquitie with a willing reverence
wee are drawne unto Idolatry. Too much Ceremony
and an affected pompe hath begot much Superstition in
the Sacrament amongst the Papists. Too carelesse a
presumption hath begot much irreverence in the Sacrament
amongst the Anabaptists. The mean betwixt both is the
safe and happy way attended with a persevering care, not
to decline, either to the one, or to the other, either
to the right hand, or to the left.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Crucy.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thanke you for your good counsels, and shall
endeavour to embrace them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Factious.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I shall acknowledge my selfe to be much
improved by you which doth embolden me to propound
one question more, and that is concerning the Originall,
and the Institution of Bishops.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Accept.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should with much content lend eare to your 
Conference, but see the Towne is neare, and within the
full view of our eye; we will therefore for this day repose
our minds as well as bodyes; and refer the discourse untill
the Morning.
