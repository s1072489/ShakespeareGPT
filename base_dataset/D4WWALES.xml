   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And the following Depositions were all taken
upon Oath.</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech>Elizabeth <font>Lady Marchioness of</font> Powis, <font>Deposeth</font> ,
   That about the 29th of <font>December</font> last, the
Queen was likely to Miscarry; whereupon
she immediately went unto her, and offered her
some effectual Remedies, which are made use of
on the like Occasion; which the Queen ordred
this Deponent to acquaint the Doctors with.
The day following the Queen Dowager sent this
Deponent to see how the Queen did; who
replied, She had a pretty good Night, and did
think she had Quickned, but would not be positive
till she felt it again; That after this the
Deponent did frequently wait on the Queen in the
Morning, and did see her Shift her several days,
and generaely saw the Milk, and sometimes Wet
upon her Smock. That some time, after this
Deponent went into the Country, and came not
up till a few days before the Queen was brought
to Bed; and from the time of this Deponents 
Return, she saw the Queen every day till she
was brought to Bed, and was in the Room a
Quarter of an hour before, and at the time of her
Delivery of the Prince by Mrs. <font>Wilks</font> Her Majesty's
Midwife, which this Deponent saw, and
immediately went with the Prince, carried by Mrs. 
<font>Delabadie</font> into the Queens little Bed-chamber,
where she saw Sir <font>Thomas Witherley</font> sent for by
the Midwife, who gave the Child Three Drops
of something which came into the World with
him, which this Deponent saw done; And this
<pagebreak id="8" />
Deponent doth Aver, this Prince to be the same
Child which was then Born, and that she
has never been from him one day since.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>* <font>Eliza. Powis.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Anne <font>Countess of</font> Aran <font>Deposeth</font> ,  
   That she went to the Queen from <font>Whitehall</font> to
St. <font>James's</font> as soon as she heard that her
Majesty was in Labour; when she came, she found
the Queen in Bed, complaining of little Pains;
The Lady <font>Sunderland</font> , Lady <font>Roscomon</font> , Mrs.
<font>Labadie</font> , and the Midwife, were on that side of
the Bed where the Queen lay; and this Deponent,
with a great many others, stood on the other
side all the time till the Queen was Delivered;
As soon as her Majesty was Delivered, she said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>O Lord, I don't hear the Child Cry</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>and
immediately upon that, this Deponent did hear it Cry,
and saw the Midwife take the Child out of the
Bed, and give it to Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> , who carried it
into the little Bed-Chamber, where she, this 
Deponent, followed her, and saw that it was a Son,
and that likewise she, the Deponent, hath
several times seen Milk run out upon the Queens
Smock during her being with Child.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>A. Aran.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Penelope <font>Countess of</font> Peterborow <font>Deposeth</font> ,
   That she was often with the Queen, while
Her Majesty was last with Child, and saw the
Milk often upon her Majesty's Smock, when she,
the Deponent, took it off from the Queen; and
often saw her Majesty's Belly so as it could not
<pagebreak id="9" />
be otherwise but that she was with Child. That
the said Deponent stood by the Bedside on the
10th of <font>June</font> last in the Morning, while the
Queen was Delivered of the Prince of <font>Wales</font> .</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>P. Peterborow.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Anne <font>Countess of</font> Sunderland <font>Deposeth</font> ,
   That <font>June</font> the 10th 1688, being <font>Trinity
Sunday</font> , the Deponent went to St. <font>James's</font>
Chappel at eight of the Clock in the morning,
intending to Receive the Sacrament; but in the
beginning of the Communion Service, the Man which
looks to the Chappel came to the Deponent, and
told her, she must come to the Queen; The
Deponent said, she would as soon as Prayers
were done; In a very little time after, another
Man came up to the Altar to the Deponent, and
said, the Queen was in Labour, and the
Deponent must come to her Majesty, who then went
directly to the Queens Bed-Chamber. As soon
as the Deponent came in, her Majesty told her, 
this Deponent, she believed she was in Labour.
By this time the Bed was warmed, and the
Queen went into Bed, and the King came in.
The Queen asked the King, if he had sent for
the Queen Dowager; He said he had sent for
every Body. The said Deponent stood at the
Queen's Boulster, the Lady <font>Roscomon</font> , Mrs.
<font>Delabadie</font> , and the Midwife on that side of the Bed,
where the Queen was Delivered. After some
lingring Pains, the Queen said, she feared she
should not be brought to Bed a good while; but
enquiring of the Midwife, she assured her
<pagebreak id="10" />
Majesty, that she wanted only one thorow Pain to
bring the Child into the World; Upon which
the Queen said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is impossible, the Child lies so
high, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and commanded this Deponent to lay her
Hand on her Majesty's Belly, to feel how high the
Child lay, which the Deponent did; but soon
after a great Pain came on at past Nine of the
Clock, and the Queen was Delivered; which the
Midwife by pulling the <font>Deponent</font> by the Coat,
assured her was a Son, it being the Sign she told
the <font>Deponent</font> she would give her, the Queen
having charged her not to let her Majesty know
presently, whether it was Son or Daughter.
As soon as the Midwife had given the <font>Deponent</font> 
the Sign, the <font>Deponent</font> made a Sign to the King
that it was a Son. When the Midwife had done
her Office, she gave the Child to Mrs. <font>Delabadie</font> ,
which was a Son, and she carried it into the
little Bed-Chamber.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>A. Sunderland.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Isabella <font>Countess of</font> Roscommon <font>Deposeth</font> ,
   That on the 10th of <font>June</font> last, she stood by

Bed-Chamber, while the Queen was in Labour, and
saw the Prince of <font>Wales</font> , when he was taken out
of the Bed by the Midwife.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>I. Roscommon.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Margaret <font>Countess of</font> Fingall <font>Deposeth</font> ,
   That she waited on the Queen Dowager her
Mistress into the Queens Bed-Chamber at
St. <font>James's</font> , when the Queen was in Labour, and
stood by the Bed's Feet, when her Majesty was
<pagebreak id="11" />
Delivered of the Prince. That the <font>Deponent</font> saw
the Prince carried away into another Room, and
soon after follow'd, and saw him in that Room.</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>* <font>Marg. Fingall.</font> </nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady</font> Sophia Bulkeley <font>Deposeth</font> , 
   That she was sent for on <font>Trinity Sunday</font> last past
about Eight a Clock in the Morning to go
to St. <font>James's</font> ; for the Man that came, said the
Queen was in Labour, and he, and others were
sent to call every Body. That this <font>Deponent</font> 
made as much hast as she could to rise and be
dress'd, but did not get to the Queens 
Bed-chamber until a little after Nine a Clock, and then this
<font>Deponent</font> found the Queen in her Bed, and the
Queen Dowager there set upon a Stole, and
some of the Ladies about her. After this
<font>Deponent</font> having staid a little while, and thinking the
Queen in no strong Pain, she, this <font>Deponent</font> ,
went out, and, being next to the Room where
the Queens Linen was a warming, heard a noise,
and look'd to see what was the matter, and
finding no Body there, this <font>Deponent</font> ran and found
the Lord <font>Feversham</font> in the Queens little
Bed-Chamber, who told this <font>Deponent</font> the Child was
just born; This <font>Deponent</font> ask'd him,</nonSpeech><dialogue> what is it?
</dialogue><nonSpeech>His Lordship said he could not tell. So this
<font>Deponent</font> ran on to the Queens Bed-side, and heard
the Queen say to the Midwife,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Mrs. <font>Wilks</font> ,
don't part the Child </dialogue><nonSpeech> (which signifies, don't cut
the Navel-String, until the after-Birth is come
away.) And while the Queen was with Child,
this <font>Deponent</font> had heard her Majesty Command
<pagebreak id="12" />
her Midwife not to do otherwise, it being
counted much the safest way; but to what the Queen
said just then (to the best of this <font>Deponent's</font> 
Remembrance) Mrs. <font>Wilks</font> replied,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Madam,
give me leave, for I will do nothing, but what
will be safe for your Self and Child; </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Queen
Answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Do then, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and then cry'd</nonSpeech><dialogue> where is the
King gone? </dialogue><nonSpeech>His Majesty came immediately from 
the other side of the Bed (from just having a 
sight of the Child) and answered the Queen,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Here
I am; </dialogue><nonSpeech>the Queen said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why do you leave me
now? </dialogue><nonSpeech>The King kneeled on the Bed, on that
side where the <font>Deponent</font> stood, and a little after
the Midwife said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> all is now come safe away;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Upon that the King rose from the Bed, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray my Lords, come and see the Child: </dialogue><nonSpeech>The
King follow'd Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> , and the Lords His
Majesty, into the little Bed-Chamber, where
this <font>Deponent</font> follow'd also, and saw as well as
they, that it was a Prince, and that Mrs. <font>Wilks</font>
was in the right to desire to part the Child,</nonSpeech><dialogue> For
the Prince's Face, especially his Forehead was
blackish, being stunn'd, as I have seen some
other Children, when they have been just newly
come into the World; but God be thanked, in
two hours time that he was dress'd and wash'd,
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (which the <font>Deponent</font> staid by and saw done) </nonSpeech><dialogue> the
Prince look'd very fresh and well. </dialogue><nonSpeech>This <font>Deponent</font>
doth further add, That all the while, the Queen
was with Child, this <font>Deponent</font> had the honour to
pay her Duty very often Mornings and Nights,
in waiting upon her Majesty in her Dressing Room
and Bed-Chamber, and for the last three or four
<pagebreak id="13" />
Months, this <font>Deponent</font> hath oftentimes seen the
Queens Milk, as well as when this <font>Deponent</font> hath
had the honour to put on her Majesty's Smock.</nonSpeech>

the <font>Deponent's</font> Servant seeing the Queen
Dowager's Coaches in St. <font>James's</font> at an unusual hour,
went and asked the Occasion, and was told the
Queen was in Labour; whereupon he came into
the <font>Deponent's</font> Chamber, and awaked her; That
the Queen having come to Lodge at St. <font>James's</font>
but the Night before, they being in a great
hurry, forgot to call the <font>Deponent</font> as her Majesty had
ordered; That the <font>Deponent</font> made all the haste
she could into her Majesties Bed-Chamber; and
found the Queen in Bed, and Mrs. <font>Wilks</font> her
Majesty's Midwife, sitting by the Bedside, with her
Hands in the Queen's Bed; The Queen asked her,
the said Midwife, what she thought? Mrs. <font>Wilks</font>
assured her Majesty, that at the next great Pain
the Child would be born; Whereupon the King
ordered the Privy-Councellours to be called in;
That this <font>Deponent</font> stood behind the Midwife's
Chair, and immediately after the Queens
having another great Pain, the Prince was Born;
That this <font>Deponent</font> saw the Child taken out of the
Bed with the Navel-string hanging to its Belly;

the Queens Belly while her Majesty was in Bed,
<pagebreak id="15" />
and that she was present when the Child was
Born, and staid till she heard it cry, and then
went to fetch Vinegar for the Queen to smell to;
she, the <font>Deponent</font> , heard the Queen command the

fear of surprizing Her Majesty: When the
<font>Deponent</font> brought the Vinegar, she did desire to see

Order. And this <font>Deponent</font> further saith, That
when the Child was born, it not crying, the
<font>Queen</font> said she thought it was dead, this
<font>Deponent</font> assured her Majesty it was not, and desired
Leave to part the Child from the After-burthen:
Which the <font>Queen</font> was unwilling to have done,
thinking it might be dangerous to her self; but
the <font>Deponent</font> assuring her Majesty it would not, 
her Majesty gave Consent; whereupon the
Child presently cryed, and then the <font>Deponent</font>
gave it to Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> .</nonSpeech>

   That about Nine of the Clock on the 10th
of <font>June</font> last in the Morning, she came
into the Bed-chamber, and heard the <font>Queen</font> cry
out, being in great Pain, in which she
continued until her Delivery; after which she the
<font>Deponent</font> saw the Prince of <font>Wales</font> given by the
Midwife to Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> ; That immediately
after the <font>Deponent</font> saw the Midwife hold up the
After-burthen, shewing it to the Company, and
then the <font>Deponent</font> fetch'd her Maids, and
<pagebreak id="22" />
with them took away all the foul Linnen hot as
they came from the <font>Queen</font> ; That for a Month
after her Majesty's Lying in, the <font>Deponent</font> well
knows by the washing of her Linnen, that the
<font>Queen</font> was in the same Condition that all other
Women use to be on the like Occasion; And
that some time after her quick'ning it appeared
by her Smocks, that her Majesty had Milk in
her Breasts, which continued until she was
brought to Bed, and afterwards during the

enough, but as soon as she did, she made all the
Haste she could to dress her; but the <font>Queen</font> was
delivered before she the <font>Deponent</font> came; And
that at a Time when the <font>Queen</font> apprehended
she should miscarry, and the Physicians made
her Majesty keep her Bed for that Reason, the
<font>Deponent</font> went one Evening to wait upon her
Majesty, and as she stood by her Bed-side, her
Majesty said to her,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Milk is now very
troublesome, it runs out so much</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>The <font>Deponent</font> asked
the <font>Queen</font> if it used to do so; who answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>It used to run out a little, but now the Fright I am

was almost constantly with the <font>Queen</font> , while she
was with Child, and hath put on her Smock,

   That he being sent for to St. <font>James's</font> on the
Tenth of <font>June</font> last by a Messenger that
left Word the <font>Queen</font> was in Labour; soon after
he, this Deponent, came to St. <font>James's</font> , and
was sent for into the <font>Queen's</font> Bed-chamber, and
to the best of his, the Deponent's
Apprehension the <font>Queen</font> was in Labour, and had a Pain
or two to the best of the Deponent's
Remembrance, before the rest of the Lords were called
in. The Deponent stood all the time at the
<pagebreak id="24" />
<font>Queen's</font> Bedside, and heard her cry out several
Times as Women in Travail use to do, and at
length after a long Pain, it was by some of the
Women on the other Side of the Bed said the
Child was born. The Deponent heard the
<font>Queen</font> say, she did not hear it cry. The
Deponent immediately ask'd the Lord President
what it was, he whispered that it was a Boy,
which the deponent understood he had hinted 
to him by the Lady <font>Sunderland</font> . Immediately
the Deponent saw a Gentlewoman, who he
hath since heard her Name to be Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> ,
carry the Child into another Room, whither
the Deponent followed, and saw the Child when
she first opened it, and saw it was black and
reeking; so that it plainly seemed to this Deponent
to have been newly come from the Womb. The
Deponent doth therefore depose, he doth
stedfastly believe the <font>Queen</font> was delivered of that
Child that very Morning.</nonSpeech>

last, he was sent to, to come to St. <font>James's</font> ,
the <font>Queen</font> being in Labour. The Deponent
immediately went, and found many Lords of
the Council there. After having been some
time in an outward Room, first the Lord
Chancellour, and then the rest of the Council were
called into the <font>Queens's</font> Bed-chamber, where in a
<pagebreak id="25" />
short time her Majesty was brought to Bed.
The Deponent saw Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> carry the Child
into the next Room, whither the Deponent

Ten of the Clock in the Morning, where he
found several Lords of the Council; in a little
time after they were all called into the <font>Queen's</font>
Bed-chamber; in less than a Quarter of an
Hour after, she fell into the Sharpness of her
Labour, her Cries were so vehement, and
especially the last, that the Deponent could not
forbid himself the being concern'd for her great
Pain; which the Deponent expressing to the
Lord Chancellour, he told the Deponent it was
a Sign Her Majesty would the sooner be
delivered, or Words to that Purpose, which proved
very true, for presently after she was so; the
Deponent heard a Whispering up and down that
it was a Prince, for no Man was permitted to
speak it aloud, lest the sudden Knowledge of it
might have discomposed the <font>Queen</font> ; the
Deponent did not go in with some Lords when the
Child was carry'd into the next Room, which
<pagebreak id="26" />
was the Occasion the Deponent did not see him

   That he was just at the Bed's Feet, and

was, with some other Lords of his Majesty's
Privy Council, called into the Queen's Great
Bed-chamber to be present at her Delivery, and
as near as this <font>Deponent</font> can remember, the
Queen made Three Groans or Squeeks, and at
the Last of Three was delivered of a Child;
the which was carry'd out into the Little
Bed-chamber; and there by the Fire this <font>Deponent</font>
<pagebreak id="27" />
saw it cleansing: And this <font>Deponent</font> further
saith, That he took that particular Mark of
this Child, that he may safely averr, that the
Prince of <font>Wales</font> is that very Child that then was
so brought out of the Queen's Great

between 8 and 9 a Clock in the 
Morning, Mr. <font>Nicholas</font> , One of his Majesty's
Grooms of his Bed-chamber, came into this
<font>Deponent's</font> Room, and told him that the King
had sent him to tell the <font>Queen Dowager</font> , that
the Queen was in Labour, and told him further
that the <font>Queen Dowager</font> had given Order for her
Coach, as soon as she heard the News of the
Queen's Labour. The <font>Deponent</font> dressed
himself with all speed, and came to wait upon the
Queen Dowager, who was ready to go into her
Coach, as she did; the <font>Deponent</font> went into
One of her Coaches to wait upon her Majesty as
he us'd to do, having the Honour to be her
Lord Chamberlain; we went to St. <font>James's</font> ,
and then led her Majesty into the Queen's
Bed-chamber, and finding the Queen in Pain,
the Deponent went into the next Room, where
were several Lords of the Privy Council, from
whence the <font>Deponent</font> heard the <font>Queen</font> cry out
<pagebreak id="28" />
several times, and a very little after the Lords
of the Council were called in, and the <font>Deponent</font>
followed them into the Bed-chamber, and a
very little after the <font>Queen</font> cry'd louder, and then
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray do not tell me what it is yet. </dialogue><nonSpeech>The
<font>Deponent</font> went out of the Room, to tell the News,
that the <font>Queen</font> was brought to Bed; and when
the <font>Deponent</font> came in again, the News was,
that it was a Prince; and immediately the 
<font>Deponent</font> saw Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> with the Child wrapp'd
up in her Hands, and in the Crowd; upon
which the <font>Deponent</font> desired to make room for
the Prince, and followed her into the Little

Hour after the <font>Queen</font> was brought to
Bed, and only heard that her Majesty was
brought to Bed of a Prince, which the <font>Deponent</font>

   That the 10th of <font>June</font> last past, 
betwixt 8 and 9 of the Clock in the
Morning, he had Notice that the <font>Queen's</font> Majesty
was in Labour, whereupon the <font>Deponent</font> made
<pagebreak id="29" />
what Haste he could to St. <font>James's</font> ; the 
<font>Deponent</font> found the Earl of <font>Craven</font> waiting at the
<font>Queen's</font> Bed-chamber Door towards the
Drawing-room, which was then shut; just after
the King opened it, and called the Earl of
<font>Craven</font> and the <font>Deponent</font> in; the <font>Deponent</font> asked his
Majesty, how the <font>Queen</font> was? He was pleased
to answer the <font>Deponent</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you are a married
Man, and so may know these Matters; the
Water is broke or come away, </dialogue><nonSpeech>or to that effect;
and then bid the <font>Deponent</font> go into the
Dressing-room within the Bed-chamber, where the
<font>Deponent</font> found several Persons of <font>Quality</font> ; above
half an Hour after, to the best of this
<font>Deponent's</font> Memory, all the Company in that Room
were called into the Bed-chamber; the
<font>Deponent</font> stood near the Bed's Feet on the left Side,
where he heard the Queen's Groans, and
presently after several loud Shrieks; the last, the
Deponent remembers continued so long, that
he then wondred how any Body could hold their
Breath so long; presently after, the Deponent
heard them say, the Queen was delivered:
Whereupon the Deponent stepped up to the
Bed-side, and saw a Woman, he supposes, the
Midwife, kneeling at the other Side of the Bed,
who had her Hands and Arme within the
Bed-cloaths for a pretty while, then the <font>Deponent</font> saw
her spread a Cloth upon her Lap, and laid the
End of it over the Bed-cloaths, and then fetch
a Child (as the Deponent firmly believes, for he
could not then see it) out of the Bed into that
Cloth, and give it to Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> , who brought
<pagebreak id="30" />
it round to the Side where the <font>Deponent</font> stood,
and carry'd it into a little Room, into which
the <font>Deponent</font> immediately followed the King,
and saw her sit down by the Fire, and heard
her say,</nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a Boy; </dialogue><nonSpeech>upon which the King
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me see it; </dialogue><nonSpeech>thereupon she laid open
the Cloth, and shewed all the Child, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
There's what you wish to see; </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Deponent
doth not charge his Memory with the very
Words, but the Sense of what he heard. The
Deponent looked upon the Child at the same 
time, which appeared to be very foul. This
Deponent desireth Pardon if he doth not know
the proper Expression, but hopes his Meaning
is plain.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>John <font>Earl of</font> Melfort, <font>deposeth</font> ,
   That on <font>Sunday</font> the 10th of <font>June</font> last, betwixt
8 and 9 in the Morning, the <font>Deponent</font>
was informed, that the Queen was in Labour;
The Deponent went to St. <font>James's</font> and waited
in the Queen's Drawing-room till some of the
Gentlemen told him he might go in; the
Deponent scratched at the Door of the Bed-chamber,
and finding no Answer, he ran down by the
Garden Side and came to the Queen's
Back-stairs, and finding the Dressing-room Door 
open, the <font>Deponent</font> went into the Queen's
Bed-chamber, where he saw a great Number of
Company, Lords and Ladies standing about
the Bed: The Deponent heard the Queen cry
out in great Pain, as Women use to do when
<pagebreak id="31" /> 
they are near being brought to Bed; the
Deponent heard her complain, and a Woman's Voice
which the Deponent thought to be the Midwife,
telling her, she would be quickly well, she
would be brought to Bed immediately; within
a little the Deponent heard the Ladies behind
the Bed say, the Queen was brought to Bed,
and the Queen cry out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> The Child is dead, I
do not hear it cry, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and immediately the Child
cryed; within a little the Deponent saw a
Woman bring a Child from within the Bed; the
Deponent looked so earnestly at the Child, that he
knew not what Woman it was; the Child was
in the Condition of a new born Child, lapp'd up
in loose Cloaths; the Deponent saw him carried
into the Little Bed-chamber, and went about
by the Dressing-room, and entred by the other
Door into the Room where the Prince was, and
saw him in the Condition of a new born Child;
and the Deponent by the Oath he hath taken,
believes him to be the Queen's Child.</nonSpeech>

Council, being one of the last; and the Queen
Dowager being there, and several Ladies, the Room
was so full that the Deponent could not get near
the <font>Bed</font> , but stood by the Chimney; There the
Deponent heard the Queen cry out several times,
as Women use to do that are in Labour; and the
<pagebreak id="32" />
last Cry that the Deponent heard, was much
greater than the other; immediately upon that,
the Deponent was called out of the Room, to
give some Directions about the Lodgings that
were preparing for the Child, which were not
ready; the <font>Deponent</font> made hast back again, but
as he was coming, he met People running with
the News that the Queen was Deliver'd of a Son,
whereupon the Deponent went into the little

about 9 of the Clock, as he came out of the
Chappel at <font>Whitehall</font> after the first Sermon,
hearing that the Queen was in Labour, he, the 
Deponent, made haste to St. <font>James's</font> , because in
waiting, as an Officer of the Green Cloth, to
warn the several Servants below Stairs to be in
their Offices, that upon that occasion there might 
not happen to be any thing wanting of Houshold
Provisions and Necessaries under his, this
Deponent's, Command; but first going up by the
Back-Stairs, into her Majesty's Dressing-Room, and
being there with many others, he heard her
Majesty cry out very loudly; whereupon this
Deponent hastned to the <font>Green-Cloth</font> , and ordered the
several Servants to deliver out of their several
Offices whatsoever should be called for, and as this
Deponent was returning back to the Queen's
said Dressing-Room, he was told, A Prince was
Born: Upon which News, He, this Deponent,
<pagebreak id="33" />
went into the Queen's Little Bed-chamber, and

That upon <font>Sunday</font> the 10th of <font>June</font> last, he had
the Honour to be in waiting upon the King
with the Stick, and between 8 and 9 in the
Morning, this Deponent was in the Queen's
Dressing Room at St. <font>James's</font> , with several Lords of
the Council, and after some time we were there,
the King came out of the Queen's <font>Bed-chamber</font> ,
and called all the Lords in, and this Deponent
went in along with them, being in waiting;
immediately after the said Lords and this Deponent
were in the Room; the Queen cryed out
extremely, and said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Oh, I die; you kill me, you kill me</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>And
the Midwife (as this Deponent believeth)
answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This one Pain, Madam, and 'twill be over</font> ;
</dialogue><nonSpeech>then presently Mrs. <font>Dawson</font> made this Deponent
the Sign that the Child was born: Then this
<font>Deponent</font> heard the Queen say,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Don't tell me what it is
yet</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and Mrs. <font>Dawson</font> came to this Deponent, and
whispered him in the Ear,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>'Tis a Prince, but don't
take notice of it yet</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then Mrs. <font>Delabadie</font> brought
away the Child from the <font>Bed-side</font> , and carry'd it
into the Little Bed-chamber, and the King and
the Lords of the Council went after her, but this
Deponent did not follow them.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Edward Griffin.</font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> Charles Scarburgh , <font>First Physician to the King,
   deposeth</font> ,
   That upon the Deponent's coming to
Visit Her Majesty then lying at St.
<font>James's</font> on <font>Sunday</font> the 10th of <font>June</font> , 1688. as
<pagebreak id="34" />
the Deponent went up the Back-stairs, he heard
the joyful Acclamation that a Prince of <font>Wales</font> was
born, upon which the Deponent hastned 
presently into the Little Bed-chamber, where the
Deponent found Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> just sitting down before
the Fire, with the new born Prince wrapped in
the Mantles, lying in her Lap. Then passing to
the Queen in the next Bed-chamber, the
Deponent congratulated the happy Birth of the Prince,
and her Majesty's safe Delivery. The Queen was
wearied and panting, but otherwise in good
Condition: Then the <font>Midwife</font> brought to the
Deponent the <font>After-birth</font> reeking warm, which Sir
<font>Thomas Witherley</font> with the Deponent examined, and
found very sound and perfect. After a while the
Deponent understood that a <font>Medicine</font> was
mentioned among the Ladies for a certain Remedy
against Convulsions: It was some Drops of Blood
from the Navel-string; the Deponent consulted
Sir <font>Thomas Witherley</font> and the other Physicians; and
to satisfie the Women, it was allowed of; there
being, as was conceived, no Danger in the thing.
Whereupon, the <font>Midwife</font> , with a small Knife slit
the Navel-string beyond the Ligature, from
which came some Drops of fresh Blood, taken in a
Spoon, and given the Child, being mixed with a
little <font>Black-cherry-water</font> . Thus much the Deponent
hath to say upon her Majesty's present Delivery.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Now for the Time of the Queen's Conception,
she often told the Deponent and others, that she
had two Reckonings; One, from <font>Tuesday</font> the 6th
of <font>September</font> , when the King returned from his
Progress to the Queen then at <font>Bath</font> ; and the other,
from <font>Thursday</font> the 6th of <font>October</font> , when the Queen
<pagebreak id="35" />
came to the King at <font>Windsor</font> ; but for some
Reasons the Queen rather reckoned from the latter;
tho' afterward it proved just to agree with the
former. <font>Moreover</font> , her Majesty, when, according
to her Reckoning, she was gone with Child 12 
Weeks, said, That she was quick, and perceived
the Child to move; the Deponent returned no
Answer to the Queen, but privately told those
about her, that in truth it could not so be in so short
a Time. Yet the Queen was in the right, only
mistook her Reckoning; for she was then full
Sixteen Weeks gone with Child; about which time
she usually quickned with her former Children,
and accordingly was brought to Bed on the 10th
of <font>June</font> 1688, and within Three or Four Days of
full Forty Weeks.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Charles Scarburgh.</font> </nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> Thomas Witherley, <font>second Physician to the
   King, deposeth</font> ,
   That on <font>Sunday</font> the 10th of <font>June</font> , the 
Deponent was present in the Queen's <font>Bed-chamber</font> ,
when the Prince of <font>Wales</font> was born; the
Deponent saw Mrs. <font>Labadie</font> bring the Child from the
Midwife, and carry him into the next Room, 
whither the Deponent followed her, and saw the
Child before he was cleaned; and having a
Command from the Queen, that there should be Two
Drops of the Blood of the After-burthen given the
first thing; we the said Deponent and the other
Physicians did take Two Drops of Blood from
the Navel-string which remained upon the Child,
and gave it in a Spoonful of <font>Black-cherry-water</font> , as
the Queen commanded. After this the Deponent
saw (as also did the other Physicians) the
After-burthen entire.</nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Tho. Witherley.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="36" />
<nonSpeech> <font>Sir</font> William Waldgrave <font>Knt. Her Majesty's first
   Physician, Deposeth,</font> ,
   That in the Progress of Her Majesty's being 
with Child, the Deponent having the
Honour to wait upon Her as usual, upon the 13th
of <font>February</font> 1687. about Ten in the Morning,
she told the Deponent, she had Milk in her
<font>Breasts</font> which dropp'd out; it was then thought
the 19th Week according to One Reckoning,
but according to Another Reckoning, it was the
One or Two and Twentieth Week; The 
Deponent also Affirmeth, that Her Majesty took such
Adstringent Medicines, during the most part of
her being with Child, in order to avoid
Miscarriage; That if she had not been with Child,
they must have been Prejudicial to her Health,
and of dangerous Consequence. Upon the 10th of
<font>June</font> 1688. the Deponent was called at his
Lodging in <font>Whitehall</font> to wait upon the Queen, being
