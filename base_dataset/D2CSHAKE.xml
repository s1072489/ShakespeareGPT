   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma. Pa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We three to hear it, &amp; end it between them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Euan.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ferry goo't, I will make a priefe of it in my
note-booke, and we wil afterwards orke vpon the cause,
with as great discreetly as we can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pistoll.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He heares with eares.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Euan.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Teuill and his Tam: what phrase is this?
he heares with eare? why, it is affectations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pistoll</font> , did you picke M. <font>Slenders</font> purse?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, by these gloues did hee, or I would I might
neuer come in mine owne great chamber againe else, of
seauen groates in mill-sixpences, and two <font>Edward</font>
Shouelboords, that cost me two shilling and two pence a
peece of <font>Yead Miller</font> : by these gloues.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is this true, <font>Pistoll</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Euan.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, it is false, if it is a picke-purse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, thou mountaine Forreyner: Sir <font>Iohn</font> , and
Master mine, I combat challenge of this Latine Bilboe:
word of deniall in thy <font> <foreign>labras</foreign> </font> here; word of denial; froth,
and scum thou liest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By these gloues, then 'twas he.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nym.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be auis'd sir, and passe good humours: I will
say marry trap with you, if you runne the nut-hooks
humor on me, that is the very note of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By this hat, then he in the red face had it: for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made
me drunke, yet I am not altogether an asse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you <font>Scarlet</font> , and <font>Iohn</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why sir, (for my part) I say the Gentleman had
drunke himselfe out of his fiue sentences.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is his fiue sences: fie, what the ignorance is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And being fap, sir, was (as they say) casheerd: and
so conclusions past the Car-eires.
<pagebreak id="40C2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, you spake in Latten then to: but 'tis no
matter; Ile nere be drunk whilst I liue againe, but in honest,
ciuill, godly company for this tricke: if I be drunke, Ile
be drunke with those that haue the feare of God, and not
with drunken knaues.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Euan.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So got-udge me, that is a vertuous                
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: vertuons</comment> minde.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You heare all these matters deni'd, Gentlemen;

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M=r=. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay daughter, carry the wine in, wee'll

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M=r=. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now Mistris <font>Ford</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mistris Ford</font> , by my troth you are very wel met:
by your leaue good Mistris.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>M=r=. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome: come,
we haue a hot Venison pasty to dinner; Come
gentlemen, I hope we shall drinke downe all vnkindnesse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had rather then forty shillings I had my booke
of Songs and Sonnets heere: How now <font>Simple</font> , where
haue you beene? I must wait on my selfe, must I? you
haue not the booke of Riddles about you, haue you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Booke of Riddles? why did you not lend it to
<font>Alice Short-cake</font> vpon Alhallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come Coz, come Coz, we stay for you: a word
with you Coz: marry this, Coz: there is as 'twere a
tender, a kinde of tender, made a farre-off by Sir <font>Hugh</font> here:
doe you vnderstand me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Sir, you shall finde me reasonable; if it be so,
I shall doe that that is reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but vnderstand me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So I doe Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Euan.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Giue eare to his motions; (M=r=. <font>Slender</font> ) I  
will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I will doe as my Cozen <font>Shallow</font> saies: I
pray you pardon me, he's a Iustice of Peace in his
Countrie, simple though I stand here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Euan.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, there's the point Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry is it: the very point of it, to Mi.           
<font>An Page</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why if it be so; I will marry her vpon any
reasonable demands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But can you affection the 'o-man, let vs command
to know that of your mouth, or of your lips: for diuers
Philosophers hold, that the lips is parcell of the mouth:
therfore precisely, ca~ you carry your good wil to y=e= maid?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Cosen <font>Abraham Slender</font> , can you loue her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope sir, I will do as it shall become one that 
would doe reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, got's Lords, and his Ladies, you must speake
possitable, if you can carry-her your desires towards her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That you must:
Will you, (vpon good dowry) marry her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will doe a greater thing then that, vpon your
request (Cosen) in any reason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay conceiue me, conceiue mee, (sweet Coz):
what I doe is to pleasure you (Coz:) can you loue the 
maid?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Slen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will marry her (Sir) at your request; but if
there bee no great loue in the beginning, yet Heauen
may decrease it vpon better acquaintance, when wee
are married, and haue more occasion to know one
another: I hope vpon familiarity will grow more content:
but if you say mary-her, I will mary-her, that I am freely 
dissolued, and dissolutely.
<pagebreak id="41C1" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is a fery discetion-answere; saue the fall is in
the'ord, dissolutely; the ort is (according to our 
meaning) resolutely: his meaning is good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I: I thinke my Cosen meant well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I, or else I would I might be hang'd (la.)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here comes faire Mistris <font>Anne</font> ; would I were 
yong for your sake, Mistris <font>Anne</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The dinner is on the Table, my Father desires
your worships company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sh.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will wait on him, (faire Mistris <font>Anne</font> .)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Eu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Od's plessed-wil: I wil not be abse~ce at the grace.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wil't please your worship to come in, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I thank you forsooth, hartely; I am very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The dinner attends you, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not a-hungry, I thanke you, forsooth: goe,
Sirha, for all you are my man, goe wait vpon my Cosen
<font>Shallow</font> : a Iustice of peace sometime may be beholding
to his friend, for a Man; I keepe but three Men, and a 
Boy yet, till my Mother be dead: but what though, yet
I liue like a poore Gentleman borne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I may not goe in without your worship: they
will not sit till you come.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray you Sir walke in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had rather walke here (I thanke you) I bruiz'd
my shin th'other day, with playing at Sword and
Dagger with a Master of Fence (three veneys for a dish of
stew'd Prunes) and by my troth, I cannot abide the smell
of hot meate since. Why doe your dogs barke so? be
there Beares ith' Towne?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke there are, Sir, I heard them talk'd of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I loue the sport well, but I shall as soone quarrell
at it, as any man in <font>England</font> : you are afraid if you see the 
Beare loose, are you not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>An.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I indeede Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's meate and drinke to me now: I haue seene
<font>Saskerson</font> loose, twenty times, and haue taken him by the
Chaine: but (I warrant you) the women haue so cride
and shrekt at it, that it past: But women indeede, cannot
abide'em, they are very ill-fauour'd rough things.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ma. Pa.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, gentle M. <font>Slender</font> , come; we stay for 
you.

twentie lasciuious Turtles ere one chaste man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why this is the very same: the very hand:
the very words: what doth he thinke of vs?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay I know not: it makes me almost
readie to wrangle with mine owne honesty: Ile entertaine
my selfe like one that I am not acquainted withall: for
sure vnlesse hee know some straine in mee, that I know
not my selfe, hee would neuer haue boorded me in this
furie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mi. Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Boording, call you it? Ile bee sure to keepe
him aboue decke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mi. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So will I: if hee come vnder my hatches,
Ile neuer to Sea againe: Let's bee reueng'd on him: let's
appoint him a meeting: giue him a show of comfort in
his Suit, and lead him on with a fine baited delay, till hee
hath pawn'd his horses to mine Host of the Garter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mi. Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I wil consent to act any villany against
him, that may not sully the charinesse of our honesty: oh
that my husband saw this Letter: it would giue eternall
food to his iealousie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why look where he comes; and my good
man too: hee's as farre from iealousie, as I am from
giuing him cause, and that (I hope) is an vnmeasurable 
distance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are the happier woman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let's consult together against this greasie
Knight: Come hither.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well: I hope, it be not so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hope is a curtall-dog in some affaires:
Sir <font>Iohn</font> affects thy wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why sir, my wife is not young.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He wooes both high and low, both rich &amp; poor,
both yong and old, one with another <font> (Ford) </font> he loues the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Loue my wife?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With liuer, burning hot: preuent:
Or goe thou like Sir <font>Acteon</font> he, with
Ring-wood at thy heeles: O, odious is the name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What name Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The horne I say: Farewell:
Take heed, haue open eye, for theeues doe foot by night.
Take heed, ere sommer comes, or Cuckoo-birds do sing.
Away sir Corporall <font>Nim</font> :

<pagebreak id="44C2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Nim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And this is true: I like not the humor of lying:
hee hath wronged mee in some humors: I should haue
borne the humour'd Letter to her: but I haue a sword:
and it shall bite vpon my necessitie: he loues your wife;
There's the short and the long: My name is Corporall
<font>Nim</font> : I speak, and I auouch; 'tis true: my name is <font>Nim</font> :
and <font>Falstaffe</font> loues your wife: adieu, I loue not the
humour of bread and cheese: adieu.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The humour of it (quoth'a?) heere's a fellow
frights English out of his wits.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will seeke out <font>Falstaffe</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I neuer heard such a drawling-affecting rogue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I doe finde it: well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not beleeue such a <font>Cataian</font> , though the
Priest o' th'Towne commended him for a true man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now <font>Meg</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mist. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether goe you <font> (George?) </font> harke you.

melancholy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I melancholy? I am not melancholy:
Get you home: goe.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith, thou hast some crochets in thy head,
Now: will you goe, <font>Mistris Page</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue with you: you'll come to dinner
<font>George</font> ? Looke who comes yonder: shee shall bee our 
Messenger to this paltrie Knight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Trust me, I thought on her: shee'll fit it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are come to see my daughter <font>Anne</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Qui.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I forsooth: and I pray how do's good Mistresse
<font>Anne</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mis. Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go in with vs and see: we haue an houres
talke with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now Master Ford?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>For.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You heard what this knaue told me, did you not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, and you heard what the other told me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doe you thinke there is truth in them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pag.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hang 'em slaues: I doe not thinke the Knight
would offer it: But these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wiues, are a yoake of his discarded men:
very rogues, now they be out of seruice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were they his men?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry were they.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I like it neuer the beter for that,
Do's he lye at the Garter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I marry do's he: if hee should intend this
voyage toward my wife, I would turne her loose to him;
and what hee gets more of her, then sharpe words, let it
lye on my head.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I doe not misdoubt my wife: but I would bee
loath to turne them together: a man may be too
confident: I would haue nothing lye on my head: I cannot
be thus satisfied.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Looke where my ranting-Host of the Garter
comes: there is eyther liquor in his pate, or mony in his
purse, when hee lookes so merrily: How now mine 
Host?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now Bully-Rooke: thou'rt a Gentleman
Caueleiro Iustice, I say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I follow, (mine Host) I follow: Good-euen,

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What saist thou, my Bully-Rooke?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you goe with vs to behold it? My merry
Host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and (I
thinke) hath appointed them contrary places: for
(beleeue mee) I heare the Parson is no Iester: harke, I will
tell you what our sport shall be.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hast thou no suit against my Knight? my

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None, I protest: but Ile giue you a pottle of
burn'd sacke, to giue me recourse to him, and tell him
my name is <font>Broome</font> : onely for a iest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Host.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My hand, (Bully:) thou shalt haue egresse and
regresse, (said I well?) and thy name shall be <font>Broome</font> . It
is a merry Knight: will you goe An-heires?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue with you mine Host.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Page.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue heard the French-man hath good skill

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Shal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tut sir: I could haue told you more: In these

I know not what: 'tis the heart (Master <font>Page</font> ) 'tis heere,
'tis heere: I haue seene the time with my long-sword, I

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Qui.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marry this is the short, and the long of it: you
haue brought her into such a Canaries, as 'tis 
wonderfull: the best Courtier of them all (when the Court lay
at <font>Windsor</font> ) could neuer haue brought her to such a 
Canarie: yet there has beene Knights, and Lords, and
Gentlemen, with their Coaches; I warrant you Coach after
Coach, letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so 
sweetly; all Muske, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silke
and golde, and in such alligant termes, and in such wine
and suger of the best, and the fairest, that would haue
wonne any womans heart: and I warrant you, they could
neuer get an eye-winke of her: I had my selfe twentie
Angels giuen me this morning, but I defie all Angels (in
any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty: and
I warrant you, they could neuer get her so much as sippe
on a cup with the prowdest of them all, and yet there has 
beene Earles: nay, (which is more) Pentioners, but I
warrant you all is one with her.

you to notifie, that her husband will be absence from his
house, betweene ten and eleuen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ten, and eleuen.

Woman, commend me to her, I will not faile her.

messenger to your worship: Mistresse <font>Page</font> hath her heartie
commendations to you to: and let mee tell you in your
eare, shee's as fartuous a ciuill modest wife, and one (I
tell you) that will not misse you morning nor euening 
prayer, as any is in <font>Windsor</font> , who ere bee the other: and
shee bade me tell your worship, that her husband is
seldome from home, but she hopes there will come a time.
I neuer knew a woman so doate vpon a man; surely I
thinke you haue charmes, la: yes in truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my
good parts aside, I haue no other charmes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Qui.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blessing on your heart for't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I pray thee tell me this: has <font>Fords</font> wife,  
and
<font>Pages</font> wife acquainted each other, how they loue me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Qui.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That were a iest indeed: they haue not so little
grace I hope, that were a tricke indeed: But Mistris <font>Page</font>
would desire you to send her your little Page of al loues:
her husband has a maruellous infectio~ to the little Page:
and truely Master <font>Page</font> is an honest man: neuer a wife in
<font>Windsor</font> leades a better life then she do's: doe what shee
will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goe to bed when
she list, rise when she list, all is as she will: and truly she
deserues it; for if there be a kinde woman in <font>Windsor</font> , she
is one: you must send her your Page, no remedie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Qu.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but doe so then, and looke you, hee may
come and goe betweene you both: and in any case haue
a nay-word, that you may know one anothers minde,
and the Boy neuer neede to vnderstand any thing; for
'tis not good that children should know any wickednes:
olde folkes you know, haue discretion, as they say, and
know the world.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Farethee-well, commend mee to them both:
there's my purse, I am yet thy debter: Boy, goe along 
with this woman, this newes distracts me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pist.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Puncke is one of <font>Cupids</font> Carriers,
Clap on more sailes, pursue: vp with your fights:
Giue fire: she is my prize, or Ocean whelme them all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Saist thou so (old <font>Iacke</font> ) go thy waies: Ile   
make
more of thy olde body then I haue done: will they yet
looke after thee? wilt thou after the expence of so much
money, be now a gainer? good Body, I thanke thee: let

<pagebreak id="46C2" />
better plight for a Lender, then you are: the which hath
something emboldned me to this vnseason'd intrusion:
for they say, if money goe before, all waies doe lye

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Money is a good Souldier (Sir) and will on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Troth, and I haue a bag of money heere

or halfe, for easing me of the carriage.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I heare you are a Scholler: (I will be briefe
with you) and you haue been a man long knowne to me,
though I had neuer so good means as desire, to make my
selfe acquainted with you. I shall discouer a thing to
you, wherein I must very much lay open mine owne 
imperfection: but (good Sir <font>Iohn</font> ) as you haue one eye 
vpon my follies, as you heare them vnfolded, turne another
into the Register of your owne, that I may passe with a
reproofe the easier, sith you your selfe know how easie it
is to be such an offender.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well Sir, proceed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is a Gentlewoman in this Towne, her
husbands name is <font>Ford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue long lou'd her, and I protest to you, 
bestowed much on her: followed her with a doating 
obseruance: Ingross'd opportunities to meete her: fee'd 
euery slight occasion that could but nigardly giue mee
sight of her: not only bought many presents to giue her,
but haue giuen largely to many, to know what shee
would haue giuen: briefly, I haue pursu'd her, as Loue
hath pursued mee, which hath beene on the wing of all
occasions: but whatsoeuer I haue merited, either in my
minde, or in my meanes, meede I am sure I haue receiued
none, vnlesse Experience be a Iewell, that I haue 
purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught mee to say
this,
   <font>&quot;Loue like a shadow flies, when substance Loue pursues,
     &quot;Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.</font>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue you receiu'd no promise of satisfaction at
her hands?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neuer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue you importun'd her to such a purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neuer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of what qualitie was your loue then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Like a fair house, built on another mans ground,
so that I haue lost my edifice, by mistaking the place,
where I erected it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what purpose haue you vnfolded this to me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>For.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When I haue told you that, I haue told you all:
Some say, that though she appeare honest to mee, yet in
other places shee enlargeth her mirth so farre, that there
is shrewd construction made of her. Now (Sir <font>Iohn</font> ) here
is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of
excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great
admittance, authenticke in your place and person, generally
allow'd for your many war-like, court-like, and learned 
preparations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Beleeue it, for you know it: there is money,
spend it, spend it, spend more; spend all I haue, onely
<pagebreak id="47C1" />
giue me so much of your time in enchange of it, as to lay
an amiable siege to the honesty of this <font>Fords</font> wife: vse 
your Art of wooing; win her to consent to you: if any
man may, you may as soone as any.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection that I should win what you would enioy? 
Methinkes you prescribe to your selfe very preposterously.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, vnderstand my drift: she dwells so securely
on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soule
dares not present it selfe: shee is too bright to be look'd
against. Now, could I come to her with any detection
in my hand; my desires had instance and argument to
commend themselues, I could driue her then from the
ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage-vow,
and a thousand other her defences, which now are
too-too strongly embattaild against me: what say you too't,
Sir <font>Iohn</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Master <font>Broome</font> , I will first make bold with your
money: next, giue mee your hand: and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enioy <font>Fords</font> wife.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O good Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I say you shall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Want no money (Sir <font>Iohn</font> ) you shall want none.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Want no <font>Mistresse Ford</font> (Master <font>Broome</font> )    
you shall 
want none: I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her
owne appointment, euen as you came in to me, her
assistant, or goe-betweene, parted from me: I say I shall be
with her betweene ten and eleuen: for at that time the
iealious-rascally-knaue her husband will be forth: come
you to me at night, you shall know how I speed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am blest in your acquaintance: do you know
<font>Ford</font> Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hang him (poore Cuckoldly knaue) I know
him not: yet I wrong him to call him poore: They say
the iealous wittolly-knaue hath masses of money, for
the which his wife seemes to me well-fauourd: I will vse
her as the key of the Cuckoldly-rogues Coffer, &amp; ther's
my haruest-home.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would you knew <font>Ford</font> , sir, that you might
auoid him, if you saw him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fal.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hang him, mechanicall-salt-butter rogue; I wil
stare him out of his wits: I will awe-him with my
cudgell: it shall hang like a Meteor ore the Cuckolds horns:
Master <font>Broome</font> , thou shalt know, I will predominate
ouer the pezant, and thou shalt lye with his wife. Come
to me soone at night: <font>Ford's</font> a knaue, and I will
aggrauate his stile: thou (Master <font>Broome</font> ) shalt know him for
knaue, and Cuckold. Come to me soone at night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ford.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a damn'd Epicurian-Rascall is this? my
heart is ready to cracke with impatience: who saies this
is improuident iealousie? my wife hath sent to him, the
howre is fixt, the match is made: would any man haue
thought this? see the hell of hauing a false woman: my
bed shall be abus'd, my Coffers ransack'd, my 
reputation gnawne at, and I shall not onely receiue this villanous 
wrong, but stand vnder the adoption of abhominable
termes, and by him that does mee this wrong: Termes,
names: <font>Amaimon</font> sounds well: <font>Lucifer</font> , well: <font>Barbason</font> ,
well: yet they are Diuels additions, the names of fiends:
But Cuckold, Wittoll, Cuckold? The Diuell himselfe
hath not such a name. <font>Page</font> is an Asse, a secure Asse; hee
will trust his wife, hee will not be iealous: I will rather 
trust a <font>Fleming</font> with my butter, Parson <font>Hugh</font> the
<font>Welsh-man</font> with my Cheese, an <font>Irish-man</font> with my 
Aqua-vitae-bottle, or a Theefe walke my ambling gelding, then
my wife with her selfe. Then she plots, then shee
<pagebreak id="47C2" />
ruminates <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: rumiuates</comment> , then shee deuises: and what   
they thinke in their
hearts they may effect; they will breake their hearts but
they will effect. Heauen bee prais'd for my iealousie:
eleuen o'clocke the howre, I will preuent this, detect
my wife, bee reueng'd on <font>Falstaffe</font> , and laugh at <font>Page</font> . I
will about it, better three houres too soone, then a
mynute too late: fie, fie, fie: Cuckold, Cuckold, Cuckold.
