</dialogue> <head>THE DIALOGUE.</head> 

<nonSpeech>It fortuned, the 
Lady <font>Listra</font> , comming
from her sumptuous
house in the Countrey
and going to ward <font>Corinth</font> ,
accompanied with two proper younge
Gentlemen her Pages, she by
chaunce, ouertooke a poore
Pilgrime, clothed with a longe vesture
of Sackcloth, and an vpper
garment of the same, with a large Felt
Hat on his head: this Pilgrime
was a man well growne in yeeres,
as appeared, by his white head and
longe beard, vnto whom the Lady
sayeth as followeth.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Lady.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well ouertaken, father
Pilgrime, and in good time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Pilgrime.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Good Madam you are
moste hartely welcome. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Father
I pray you, whether doo you
iourney this waye. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forsooth
<pagebreak id="A3V" />
Madam now God willing I meane to
passe to <font>Corinth</font> , and from thence
into <font>Asia Maior</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceyue
your Pilgrimage hath bin longe,
but when meane you to cease and
take your rest. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam when my
body is layed in Graue. For truely,
al mankinde hath but a pilgrimage
in this worlde: yea although they
liue at home in their natiue
Countrey and delectable houses, an ende
they must haue of their pilgrimage.
But I and suche other poore
Pilgrimes doo often see by Lande and
Sea, the admyrable workes of the
almightie. The which to tell when
I come home, the foolish wyll holde
me for a lyar: yet I dooe dayly more
and more, praise God, who is so
great, and this is my only
contentacion </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But tell me father
Pilgrime go you now to visit any
monument of the Goddesse <font>Flora</font> , here
in <font>Corinth</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Madam I care
not for such relikes. For my frend a
<pagebreak id="A4R" />
Philosopher warned me by y=e= waye
as I came, saying. <font> <foreign>Non licet omnibus
adicere Corinthum</foreign> </font> : yea also he
wished me not to buye repentance too
deare, among Dame <font>Floras</font> dames.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well father, doo you meane to
abide heere any long season? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No
lenger Madam then I may amend
my Shooes, Hose, and also prouide
other furniture for my Scrippe and
Bottell. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray you good father
holde me not for importunate, to
demaund of you a question or two.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rather Madam you seeme so
wise, that I receyue pleasure by
your communication: therfore good
Madam say on. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not
require of you to signifye vnto me the
lawes, customes, rites, ceremonies,
and strainge vsages of the <font>Hethites</font> ,
among whom you haue trauailed,
for I know the same to be horryble
and abhominable. But tell me I
pray you, haue you bin among the
Christians in <font>East India</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea
<pagebreak id="A4V" />
Madam I abode a certaine time, in the
famous Cittie called <font>Crangalor</font> ,
which standeth scituated neare the
pleasaunt Riuer of <font>Guadalquiuer</font> .
This Cittie is not onely adorned
with beautie of sumptuous
Temples, Towers &amp; costly Howses,
plesant Orchards, &amp; sweete Gardens:
but cheefely decked with notable
gouernment and celestiall Iustice.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hath this Countrey a Kinge or
a Prince for chiefe Lord and Ruler.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Prince forsooth called <font>Basha
Haily</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I praye you tell
what reuerence doth those subiects
to their Prince. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam 
truely exceeding great. But first they 
say, yea and stedfastly beleeue, that
theyr Prince, is the onely Deputie
and Lutenaunt of God him selfe
within his dominions, to execute
and maintaine Iustice, yea such
a one, that is not noted of any great
crime, for say they God is pure and
holy, euen so ought his Deputie to
<pagebreak id="A5R" />
be in maintayninge right and
Iustice. So that the subiects of this
Prince, are wonderfull obedient,
with life and goods, and other
loyall seruice. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then must needes
follow, that the Nobilitye are 
vertuous and prudent. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea
Madam, as members so necessarye to
so godly a Prince, they are decked
with humble harts, and farre from
all corruption. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Cleargye
then should seeme, to liue according
to the Gospell. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam I
cannot let, but highly co~mend y=e=
Cleargye, for the ritchest Bishops &amp;
Prelats are not trimmed in sylkes, but
clothed in honest dece~t attire. These
men name themselues the Criers of
God, and Steward of the poore. For
saye they euen as the lawes of the
Prince are Proclaimed, through his
dominions to the intent his
subiects should know his will, euen so
say they, are we the Cryers of God
to proclayme, preache and set foorth
<pagebreak id="A5V" />
the lawes of the euerlasting God,
as well in teaching, as in our liuing
&amp; behaueour: for if we do not so say
they, the Prophet telleth vs that
the bloud of our flock shalbe
demau~ded at our hands. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But why do
they go so plaine appareled, being
Lords and of great calling? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I of
my selfe Madam, will say no more
then I haue harde at their owne
mouthes. They say that Christ
willed his holy Apostels, to leaue their
Nets and other worldly goods, and
follow him, who in at the time, that
his sacred Maiestie abode vpon
earth, had neuer any great bodilye
rest: but continuallye like a good
Shepheard went from valley to
valley, from hill to hill, from pasture
to pasture, to seeke his lost Sheepe,
and being fou~d, brought them home
vpon his blessed shoulders, to his
hierd and Sheepefolde, calling
allwayes synners to repentaunce: so
say they we being his disciples must
<pagebreak id="A6R" />
every one of vs take vp his owne 
Crosse and followe him. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why
the~ how can they dispend the great
profit and reuenues of their
bishoprikes and other benefices. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why
Madam doo you maruell at that,
Then harken I pray you. These
good Prelats doo weekely go vnto
the common Iaile, where a great
number of prisoners are, some for
debt, and some for other offence, and
there doo they preache the worde
of God amonge them, perswading
them to repentance and to forsake
their euill liuing, they doo not onely
in this sort comfort the poore
afflicted prisoners, but also do according
to neede, cloath them which want
clothing: yea and three times in the
yeare, at the principal feasts, all such
prisoners which lie in prison for the
sum of twentye Markes or vnder,
theese good religious men, doo pay
the debt, and set the poore at liberty
with great admonishion, how to 
<pagebreak id="A6V" />
flee from fallinge into daunger
againe. This liuely worke of faith
springeth not alone in them, but
also the poore Orphants and
Maydens, which want dowries for
mariage, are prouided out of theyr
house of Mercy, yea euery sorte of
poore people are wel remembred 
amonge the~. And in this sort say they
we are Stewarde of the poore
according to Christ his 
commaundement. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then they deale not in
Vserye, or other like Marchandize.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O no good Madam those wicked
vices, are farre from them, for 
truely I may boldly saye, that at the
yeares end, all their great reuenues
are consumed, in order aforesayde.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And is there no other sorte of
religious persons, within the
dominion of <font>Crangalor</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes
Madam, there is an other sorte of
Contemplatiues, who liueth by
the labour of theyr handes, in the
Mountaines, and these are 
<pagebreak id="A7R" />
Silkeweauers, which liue onely vpon
that occupation, and at certayne
tymes doo occupye themselues in
prayer, calling vpon the name of
Iesus. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely father
Pilgrime I doo reioyce to heare of such
vertuous and religious men, who
are occupied daye and night in the
lawe of God, for I would scarcely
haue beleeued that any such had
liued on earth, well good father
proceede to the Ministers of the
Lawe. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I I shoulde not seeme
vnto you good Madam tedious:
I would say somewhat of theyr
behaueour. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Naye rather you
doo me pleasure, and I geue you
moste hartye thankes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Firste
their Iudges are excellent learned
men, &amp; such as are chosen out of the
Vniuersity, by the Princes
Counsell, for their excellency, grauitye
and learning. These graue Iudges
haue no kinde of fees, for seales or
reknowledging of writings, or such
<pagebreak id="A7V" />
like, but are maintained with
reasonable stipend at the Princes cost.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then there are no Iuries
of twelue men to trye the right of
any? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas no Madam would
you wish twelue simple men, 
without learning to decide the doubtfull
and hard cases in lawe: no, God
forbid. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will not those Iudges now
and than take bribes? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No
Madam, for the punishment is
greeuous for such an offence: yea and the
Prince to auoide that wickednesse,
dooth yeerely make preuie enquiry
of the administration of Iustice, to
gratify the good Iudges and to
punish the wicked. But yet I doo 
remember of one Iudge, that tooke a
Goose stuffed with gold for a bribe.
But when the case was knowen to
the Prince, he commaunded the
Iudges legge to be sawen off, with
a woodden sawe, in the open
Market place. And when the execution
was doon, the Prince caused the
<pagebreak id="A8R" />
Iudge to come before him, saying
vnto him: sirra is the stuffing of a
Goose good meate, but the Iudge
answered not one word. Wel quoth
the Prince receyue your office 
againe, and looke well what meate 
you eate: who ruled afterward
exceeding well. The example 
whereof did so terrifie, that bribes were
cleane banished. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now 
assuredly, this Prince may welbe called
the Deputie of God, but sythens
the Iudges are so vpright in Iustice,
than what say you to the 
Counsellers and other ministers of the law?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must needes commend them
Madam, for there the good 
Lawyers haue verye fayre and large
studies, and beset with many fayre
Chayres, so that the client when he
commeth is commaunded to sit him
downe in one of those chayres, and
to put on his bonet. Then he
openeth his case, if it appeare a iust and
lawfull sute: then the sayd Lawyer
<pagebreak id="A8V" />
deuiseth his Plea, and his Clarke
penneth the same, with the lines
neare together, for they know not
what great spaces betwixt lines
after eight pence a sheete, meaneth.
Now the Plea being drawen, and
contayne a large sheete of paper,
written as aforesayde, the Clyent
paieth to his Lawier two shillings
and three pence for the Clarke,
wherewith they are well satisfied.
But if the cause apeareth not good
and iust, then the Lawyer
perswadeth the party, not to deale any
further: and so alwayes wronge is
thrust out of the dores. These 
Lawyers abhorre couetousnesse,
and know not what Golden
Angels meane. The Iudges syt dayly
through the yeare in iudgement,
the Festiual dayes excepted, so that
there is no issue or tryall vpon one
point or braunch of a matter, but
rather by those learned Iudges, a
whole matter is ended at once,
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
which is a good and godly waye.
The Counsellers in Lawe, sit on
each syde of the Iudges: I meane
not on the same benche where the
Iudges syt, but rather on each syde
of the iudiciall place, and the
Iudges at the vpper end. So there is
no strife who shal come to the Bar:
But when any ple is related. Then
it is lawfull for euery Lawyer to
exclaime the meaning of the words
on his Clyents behalfe: but with
very fewe wordes. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But may
not the party agreeued, appeale of
any sentence? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if the cause
amount aboue the sum of one
hundred pounde, the partie agreeued
may appeale to the Princes
Counsell: where alwayes two synguler
Counsellers attendeth such causes, 
euen as a Chauncery to mittigate
extremity of Law. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then how
dooth the poore folke obtaine 
Iustice against the riche and mightye.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam wounderfull well.
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
For the poore shall haue rather
more fauour then the ritch, it is so
Madam that the most famous
learned man within the precynct of the
whole Cittie, he I say is appointed
for Aduocate of the poore, and hath
a great stipend of the Cittizens for
his paynes. And thinke you 
Madam that he is the basest office in a
Common weale? No: for this
aduocate is had in greatest honour, next
vnto the Princes Councell, &amp; chiefe
Iudges. And againe when the
complaint of the poore commeth before
the Iudges in the iudicial Hall, then
saith the Attorny of the poore, who
hath also his wages of the Citizens.
My Lords, it may please you to
heare a poore mans cause. This 
voyce is no sooner heard, when the
Iudges staieth all matters, except
it touch the estate, and incontinent
the poore mans sute is dispatched:
for if it should not be so, then many
times would it happen, as once a
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
sute depending betweene a poor
Poticary and a Butcher, for when
their Plea is determined by the
inferior Iudge: the Poticary caried
priuely to the Iudge a little Pot of
Conserua, beseeching him to
reme~ber his matter against the butcher.
The Iudge tooke it and sayde he
would prouide Iustice. But when
the Butcher heard of the presenting
of this bribe, he went and killed a 
good fat Hog and brought it to the
Iudge, requesting his fauor against
the Poticary: y=e= Iudge also receiued
it, and bad him depart. It so fell out,
that the sentence passed on the
Butchers syde. But whe~ the poore 
Poticary had notice thereof, he came
railing to the Iustice house, saying
to the Iudge: syr how chaunst you
remembred not both my right &amp; pot
of Conserua. Yes quoth the Iudge,
I remember them bothe, but as for
your Conserua, there came a Hog &amp;
threw down your pot, ye &amp; spilt it, so
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
that I neuer found any sweetenes
therein. Mary sir quoth y=e= Poticary
a murraine and a pestilence take
such a Hog that spilt both my
Iustice and Conserua. So that
Madam I tell you this merry tale,
to the ende that you may know
how in this happy Lande, it
preuaileth not for the ritch to say I
haue a fat purse: for why, the good
Iudges, hath so great a feare of
God and the Prince, that no
corruption can auaile. And certainely
the godly Diuines, are a great
cause thereof, for they will not let
to tell all estates their faultes, by
some honest meanes: by reason
whereof, they doo well know, that
they the~selues, shall come to
iudgement, and be Iudged, so that
according to the oppinion of S. <font>Ierom</font> ,
they haue dayly the sounde of the
Trumpet in their eares, that shall
call to Iudgement. And this is the
principall cause, that they do liue in
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
the feare of God, and are blessed.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I doo most highly praise this
godly rule and order. But how are
Criminall matters decided. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Forsoothe Madam the Iudges which
haue the charge of Criminall 
matters, doo likewise sit all the whole
yeare in the iudiciall place: but as I
sayde before, festiuall dayes 
excepted. These Iudges vse great
pollicye to searche out the troth, against
any accused of crime, and the troth
manifestly knowen, the offence is
corrected with greeuous
punishment: but otherwise they haue
great feare of shedding innocent
bloud, by reason wherof euery
prisoner is permitted to haue an
aduocate, &amp; make exceptions against
his accusers. And when any
offender is condemned to suffer paines
of death, he hath three dayes respite
to repent his former life, they also
haue good men that neuer leaueth
perswading them earnestly to
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
repent, and only to stick vnto the
mercy of our Lord Iesus. Truely 
Madam I haue seene some dye, with
such penitent &amp; humble harts, that
any good Christian would haue
co~mended their constant faith.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sure this is a charitable act. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I
must needes confesse Madam, that
the people in this Country are fully
perswaded, that there are but two
wayes of eternitye, the one leadeth
vnto perpetual ioy and euerlasting,
felicity, and the other to euerlasting,
horrible and vnquenchable hell fier,
the which bothe places, shall haue
no end, whilest God is God, and y=t=
is infynite. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The name of Iesus
be praised for such a Country and
people. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Also Madam whilest
I abode in <font>Crangalor</font> , I saw three
persons punished, the one was a
woman, and she was conuicted of
Sorcery &amp; Witchcraft, but no hurt
doone by her to either man <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: mau</comment>  or beast,
approoued: yet for her dealing in
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
that arte, she was condemned. The
execution was, she was set vpon an
Asse, her body naked vnto her
Nauill, and annoynted all ouer with
Honny, the which was beset full of
small Feathers of Downe, with a
Miter on her head, of a yarde long,
and in this sorte she rode about the
streets accustomed, with a
Trumpet blowen before her, and a Cryer
manifesting her offence. An other
was punished for periury, this man
rode likewise vpon an Asse, about
the accustomed streetes: but not
naked. And in the Market place, there
was a Barbor attending for hym,
with his Instruments, and there
he was foreced to open his mouthe,
and all his teeth being accoumpted,
the Barbor drew out euery fifthe
toothe, in such sort Madam, that
neither money, nor friendship can
redeeme any punishment in that
Countrey. The thyrde person that
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
I saw punished, was a wittoll and
he I say, rode vpon an Asse about
the sayd streetes, with a Hartes 
horne on his head ful of small Bels,
and his wife rode after whipping 
him, and then followed the 
hangeman whipping them bothe. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O
moste happy Land, where vice is so
punished. But I pray you say father
the poore Prisoners that are
imprisoned for det, are they put in yrons?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No Madam, for there they hold
opinion, that none ought to were
Yrons, but such as hath co~mitted
odious crimes, for otherwise say they
y=e= Iaile is no other thing but onely
a safe custody. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet they pay fees
for their Yrons. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas Mada~ God
forbid: for thinke you, that it were a
iust cause, that a poore man, who
hath fallen into debt by sundry
mishaps, should now in prison be
punished with fees of Yrons, and incurre
into a new debt: nay they hold such
vsage for abhominable extorcion,
<pagebreak id="B5R" />
and a thinge odious in the sight of
God. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But yet I thinke they
paye eighteene pence a day for their
meate, and a groate for their bead,
or at the least twelue pence a day,
and a groate for their bead. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That
also Madam is holden for an
abominable vse. But troth it is that
any Prisoner for debt, may bring
his bead, his meate and drink from
whence he wil. And if he be so poore
that he hath nothing wherewith
to maintaine himselfe. Then the
house of charitie prouided for such a
one. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What fees hath the Iayler
then? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forsooth syxe pence for
euery Prisoner, and also a yearely
stipend of the Cittizens, sufficient
to mainetaine an honest man. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I
haue father Pilgrim throughly
vnderstood all your talke. But now I
pray you how dooth the Notaries,
Skriueners, and such like officers
vse themselues. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam I must
also commend their vsage: for why
<pagebreak id="B5V" />
you shall vnderstand, that euery
Notary, Scriuener or suche like
officer, concerninge either
temporall or ecclesiasticall affaires haue
their offices from the Prince, for
a certayne summe of money vnder
the Princes Seale: the which
offices each one dooth enioye for
terme of life, except he make
resignation thereof to his sonne, or
some other friend, fifteene dayes or
more before his death and for
wante of suche resignation the
office commeth againe to the Prince:
but in effect, euer such officer geueth
sufficient Sureties to the Prince,
for the true and faithfull executing
of his office, by meane whereof all
false wrytinges, and abhominable
deceipts are vtterly banished. More
euer euery such Notary or
Scriuener hath his bookes of Recordes,
wherein the parties obliged dooth
set their firmes and seales, with two
or three witnesses, which testifye
<pagebreak id="B6R" />
that they do know, that the parties
so obliged, are the very selfe same
men, to auoide all collusion. This
doon the Scriuener vnder his
firme and sygne, geueth the partie
creaditor the copye of the Bonde,
which is auaileable, and pleadeable
in Lawe: the cause hereof is to
auoide all subtiltie, for many times
poore men by some sinister meane
or casualty, hath his writings
stollen, enbesseled, burned, or loste:
yet were it not iust, that those men
should lose their right and title.
In consideration whereof the
originall matters remayneth aliue
in the sayde Scriueners bookes,
in order aforesayde. Euery
Obligation contayneth a sheete of
Paper, neere written, for the
which the Scriuener is to haue
syxe pence and no more, and
other syxe pence for the Copye
if the partye wyll haue it. But
thys muste I saye vnto you
<pagebreak id="B6V" />
Madam the cause of this godly
gouernment is, that once in two or
three yeeres, the Prince sendeth
secret visitors: who taketh all these
Scriueners or Notaries Recordes
into theyr power, and commaunde
to Proclaime through the Cittye,
that if any person or persons, know
any falshood in the sayde Officers,
concerning their Offices, that then
they come and manifest the same: 
and the offence or offences knowen,
some hath their hands cut off, other
some depriued from their offices
and others condemned to the Gally
for slaues: yea the Lawe is that if
any writing chaunce to be
enterlyned, then must the Scriuener recite
the same words at the foote of the
writing, before the partie or 
parties seale thereto. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But is this
order throughout all the Princes
dominions, in Citties, Viliages,
and Townes? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea truely 
Madam, and all other writings of no
<pagebreak id="B7R" />
effect, except some Billes or writing
made in extreme necessity, which
are afterward recknowleged before
the Iudge, or els remaine of none
effect. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This godly order must
needes be profitable to the Prince.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay Madam much more
profitable I say to the common weale,
for the auoyding of many brabling
and wicked sutes attempted in law.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Father Pilgrim, I am well
satisfyed in these pointes. But how
dooth Maiors or other gouernours
of great Citties behaue the~selues?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam exceeding well. For
each ruler of a famous Citty
delighteth not in Glottony, and Belly
cheere, but rather is very vigilant
and carefull for the benefyt of the
Citty: he I say, commeth not vpon
dayes appointed, to visyt the
Bakers and other Vittellers, but
rather followeth the order that Christ
hath prescribed, which is how his
comming shalbe when he is not
<pagebreak id="B7V" />
looked for: euen so dooth this good
Ruler of <font>Crangalor</font> , come at suche
tymes to visyt the Cittizens, that
some dooth reioyce, but others doo
tremble at his sodaine comming, ye
in the night season when others
sleepe at quyet rest, he wandereth
round about the Cittie, personally
in all blinde lanes, and solitary 
places, to see what watch is kept, to
harken for bibbers and dronkerds,
to searche out Hoores, and 
Hooremongers, and to examine
suspitious guestes. I am sure Madam
that the Gouernour of <font>Crangalor</font> ,
hath expulsed a number of such
vicious persons, out of that Cittye,
yea it seemeth now a terrenall
paradice: but wot you what is the
cause of this? Forsoothe at the time
of the terme of expiration of the
sayde Gouernours charge, the
Prince appointeth a new 
Gouernour, who commaundeth the
former Gouernour and al his officers,
<pagebreak id="B8R" />
to keepe their owne houses as 
prisoners for the space of fortye dayes: 
and then Proclaymeth 
throughout the Cittye, that if any
person or persons, poore or ritche,
can laye any extorcion, bribes, or
other offence, against the sayde
Gouernour or Officers, that then
they come and complaine, and shall
haue present remedy and 
satisfaction. But when those fortye dayes 
are expired, and no offence founde: 
O what great Honour receyueth
such a Gouernoure: yea and how
highly is he esteemed of his Prince?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truely father Pilgrime that
is a blessed Lande: but what can
you saye of all such officers, which
hath the receite and dealinges
aboute the Princes reuenues?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Once in three yeare
Madam secret enquyrye is made of
theyr dealinges, and theyr bookes
narrowlye searched, so that the
Prynce cannot bee deceyued.
<pagebreak id="B8V" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O father Pilgrime, the sunne
declyneth apace, and loth I am to
leaue your godly conuersation: but
yet I pray you say, how dooth
women behaue themselues in that 
contrey? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very honest and 
vertuous they are Madam. For in that
Citty, you shall not see neyther 
Wiues, nor Maydes with hand
Baskets, or otherwise wander about
the Citty, because the Husbands
and theyr men slaues do prepare all
necessaries, for their houses and
Families: so that the women straye
not abroad, except on the Sabboth
day, or other Festiuall dayes, when
they go to the Temple, or els when
they go abroade in their Husbands
company to recreate themselues:
for otherwise the Husbandes feare
that they should haue some euill
wares brought home in those hand
baskets. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue yet many other
things to enquire of you: but I pray
you tel me, haue you bin at any time
<pagebreak id="C1R" />
in England? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Neuer but once
Madam, and then I came to the
famous Cittye of <font>London</font> , to take
Shipping into <font>Scithia</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But
that Lande? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Forsoothe
Madam at that time Raygned, and I
hope yet dooth, a vertuous 
Mayden Queene, whose beautye and
rare vertues, whose wisdom and
synguler learning: yea her
wonderful knowledge in sundry languages:
the like, I neuer heard nor knewe in
in any parte of the worlde where I
haue traueiled into: And yet haue I
byn in some part of <font>Asia</font> , in some part 
of <font>America</font> , and in some parte of 
<font>Europia</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is beleeue me the
straungest thinge that as yet you
haue tolde mee. God preserue her,
and if I were as younge as I haue
byn, I would gladly go see so
gracious a Lady and Maiden Queene.
But I perceyue consydering you
went that way to take Shipping
<pagebreak id="C1V" />
into the Lande of <font>Scithia</font> , you had
no leysure to enquire of the
commoditie of that Lande. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No
truely Madam, tyme would not permit
me: for I was no sooner come to
<font>London</font> , but the shippes were
readye to hoyse vp sayles and depart.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I feare father Pilgrime, the
shutting in of <font>Corinth</font> Gates,
because night approcheth on so faste:
Wherefore good father, let vs now
make the more haste, and sythe you
are a strainger here, you shall abide
this night with me, with such poore
cheare as I may make you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God
reward you good Madam, I wyll
not refuse your gentle offer.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Now the Lady <font>Listra</font> , and the
Pilgrim enter into <font>Corinth</font> , where
the Pilgrim was well entertayned
and lodged: yea and at his 
departure from thence, the Ladye gaue
him spending money, for his
iorney, with faithfull promise made by
the Pilgrime at his returne, to
<pagebreak id="C2R" />
manifest vnto that Lady, all strainge
things, that he should heare or see
in his pretended Iorney.</nonSpeech>
