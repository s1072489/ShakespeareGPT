 <head>A 
DIALOGUE, &amp;C.</head>  
   
   <nonSpeech>Sam.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How now <font>Will.</font> how comes this kindness betwixt
thee and <font>Tom.</font> the Barge-man? last time I saw you
together at <font>Dochet</font> , you were for heaving Stones at one
anothers heads.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, that's long since, and utterly forgot; we are 
now good Friends.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God-a-mercy Horse, this Rogue <font>Will.</font> was        
tugging up 
Stream whilst his Oars were ready to break at <font>Way-bridge</font> , and
seeing us come up with three good Horses Towing our Punt, his
Stomach came down, and he begg'd most devoutly to give him
a Tow to <font>Windsor</font> ; not a word of the Bell-Wether, or any of
his usual Complements. I took mercy on the poor Rogue, and let
him fasten his Wherry to us, and I think in my heart the Whelp 
has eaten us half a Stone of Beef to day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the honest word of a Waterman, <font>Tom.</font> I    
never eat 
daintier Beef in my Life, nor better Mustard, but not one
mouthful of Mutton was to be seen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sirrah, one word more of Mutton and off you go; you
cannot forbear your Roguery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But pray thee, <font>Will.</font> whither art thou making   
at this Time
of the year?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, faith <font>Sam</font> , thou knowest I follow the     
Court for 
the most part, and now I am going before it, and intend to get
a good <font>Birth</font> at <font>Oxford</font> : Acquaintance is a main matter with a
Waterman: besides, here's honest <font>Tom.</font> promises me Lodging at
his House; and when he goes for <font>London</font> , his Wife and I can
<pagebreak id="4" />
make as merry as if he were gone an <font>East-India</font> Voyage.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, I hope, there will be another Voyage found    
out, they
say the King will make us a way West-ward to <font>Bristol</font> for our
Barges, and has sent for <font>Dutchmen</font> that can make Boats go by Land
as well as by Water, and then <font>Bristol</font> will be <font>London</font> . The   
saucy 
Rogues t'other day at <font>Queen-Hith</font> were ready to Brain us, and
threatned to fire the Barges, because we belonged to <font>Oxford</font> . If
the King would take my Counsel, he should come no more 
amongst them for one seven years, I would make the proud Rogues 
know themselves better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not for that, <font>Tom</font> neither, for that would  
quite spoyl
our Ferry: when all's done <font>London</font> is <font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And will be <font>London</font> , that is, a Nest of         
unthankful Rogues
that hate us Country Gentlemen, tho' they get all they have by
us: What would <font>London</font> be worth, if it were not for the 
Country? And faith, since all the wealth of the Country is gotten 
thither by the Kings living so long amongst them, I hope His 
Majesty will even now live in the Country till their Money be
brought into the Country again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could agree well enough to all thou say'st, but   
only for
this <font>Ferry</font> , and that would quite be ruin'd if the King should    
leave
<font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For that, if the <font>Dutchmen</font> come, they will dig  
so many
Cuts to make the <font>Thames</font> run from our Town to <font>Bristol</font> , I      
warrant           
thee, thou may'st get a New <font>Ferry</font> , and better than this, upon
some of those New Cuts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But do'st think the King will keep his Court at     
<font>Oxford</font>
any long time? I heard our Parson say, for all this the 
Parliament would not be held at <font>Oxford</font> , because there was a 
Parliament once held there, and it was called the mad Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou may'st tell the Parson from me, that there    
has been
many Parliaments held at <font>London</font> , that have been worse than mad;
and it's well if this last was not the madest that ever was yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess there was a strange Touse whilst    
they were 
Sitting: Our Townsmen of <font>Windsor</font> would have talked so of the
brave Acts they were a making, and what good they would have
done to the Commonalty, and how they would have handled 
the Courtiers, and abundance more than I can remember. Thou
<pagebreak id="5" />
wouldst have admired, but to say Truth, this Town of <font>Windsor</font> ,
though they be our Neighbours, is as Roguish a place as any is in
<font>England</font> . If I were worth to advise the King, I would make a
great Wall betwixt the Castle and the Town, that should reach
down to the River on the one side, and down to <font>Old Windsor</font>
on the other side, and never a Gate through it, but for the Kings
conveniency to go a Hunting into the great Park, or the Duke
into the Forrest, and shut at all other times. Then would I build 
a New Town to entertain the Kings Court, should reach to the
<font>Ferry</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Still, still this <font>Ferry</font> is the Burden of the   
Song,
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But prethee <font>Will</font> tell us what this Parliament  
would
have done for the good of the Commonalty that is talked on so
much; thou carriedst Parliament men in thy Boat every day, and
I know thou hast heard all their Speeches; I have heard them
make Speeches as they have pass'd over here at our Ferry
Boat.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art in the right of that, for there is not one 
Member (for so we call them at <font>London</font> ) of forty, but they are   
still
making Speeches: I heard one of them make a Speech to Deaf
<font>Hugh</font> , an old Sculler, from <font>Westminster Stairs</font> to the         
<font>Temple</font> . <font>Hugh</font>
nodded at him now and then, and he went on as Policitly as if
he had been in the House all the while. When they landed at the      
<font>Temple</font> , where I also landed my Fair, he bid <font>Hugh</font> give him   
three
pence, but wanting Change, he asked me for three pence, but
I having ne're a three pence, sayes the Member to <font>Hugh</font> , I see
thou art a right English man, a good Protestant, and, I dare say,
hates the Popish Successor with all thy heart, and therefore I will
give thee the whole Six pence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Twas well he had the Wit to Nod at him, being a 
could not hear him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So it was, and that was enough, for I dare say,   
a Nod
now and then, would have continued the Speech to <font>Gravesend</font> .
O, our Water-men have thousands such Stories as these of their
Worships, they were for the most part so full of it, they could
not hold it in.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But prethee <font>Will.</font> tell us what thou heard'st   
they did in
the House as well as out.
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, in the first place they kept a              
<font>Rehearsal</font> at the
<font>Sun Tavern</font> on the back of the <font>Exchange</font> a long time before    
they 
sate.  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A <font>Rehearsal</font> ! what's that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, as the Players Rehearse or Act over the Play 
in the
Morning, which they intend to Play in the Afternoon: So, did
they make their Speeches, and set all their Matters in order in the
Tavern, before they met in the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Methinks, if it were needful for a Parliament to   
have such
a Rehearsing, his Majesty should provide them a place to rehearse
in: It is not very handsome in my mind, that the matters which
concern his Majesty and the Kingdom should be medled with in a
Tavern.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It's very true: but the Master of the House, he   
got well  
by them; and the Drawers of that House are become notable
Boyes, they can talk of State Affairs, it would do your Heart
good to hear them: and for any thing that I know, when these 
Boyes come to set up for themselves, and keep Taverns in the
City, they may be the fittest men they will have to serve in 
Parliament: they will now, as young as they are, make fine Speeches
to their fellow Prentices, when any Rout of them meets together,
and have their Lessons full ready on any occasion; and will <font>back
a Petition of the Common Hall to the Purpose</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Pox on 'em, 'tis such work as this that makes the
King leave <font>London</font> , and will undo us all at <font>Dochet</font> : But     
this is all
still out of the House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is impossible I should tell you a tenth part    
of what  
they did in the House: but the remembrance of Men and Things
they fell upon will put me in mind best; and therefore the first I
think on, is the Kings Majesty, God bless him, him they cryed
<font>Nochell</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, as <font>Gaffer Block</font> of our Town cryed his    
Wife?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know what he did, but they Voted that     
no body
should either Borrow or Lend, nor Sell or Buy with him under
pain of their Displeasure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is almost as ill as the Parson said of the    
<font>Gun-Powder-Treason-day</font> , that the Pope would have done with Queen 
<font>Elizabeth</font> , for he forbade any Body to Borrow or Lend with her,  
Sell
<pagebreak id="7" />
or Buy, Eat or Drink; Nay, he forbid her to come in either
Church or Market.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But then to make him amends, they took care to kill  
him an Old Lean Lord at <font>Christmass</font> ; and that's all I remember
they have done for him since they met.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did they then do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Next they took the Duke into handling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And what would they do with him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They would have taken away his <font>Birthright</font> ,    
whatever
he had done to them I know not, but they were resolv'd to have
worried him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was it provoked them so much against him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They said he was a <font>Papist</font> , and was for the   
Pope and 
the Plot; but the Truth on't is, I think the true Reason of their
Cruelty was, because he put his Brother in mind who were, and
had been Rogues, and were sure to prove so in the end: and for
this they would never forgive him; and with talking with one
another, they were got to that pass, they matter'd not what they
said; for they were permitted so long, they thought no body durst
gainsay them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I thought no man living durst have medled with
any of the Blood Royal.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art a Fool, did not they behead the last     
King, and
kept this banished a long time? and all that was still a House of
Commons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What would they have done with the Duke thinkest
thou?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hang'd him if they could have catch't him, but   
being
he was out of their reach, have taken away all his means, and
all he was ever like to have, if (which God forbid) he should 
have surviv'd the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were very bold.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou may'st swear that; when the Fore-man of Old
<font>Townsend's</font> Shop, a blind Scrivener was so bold as to speak a saucy  
Speech against his Highness.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What was he, a Prentice?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he was out of his Time, and had set up for 
himself.
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, I thought no such Hand-crafts men had ever been   
chosen Members.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Any body that has money to pay for Drink, Gentle or
Simple that will spend his Guinneys upon some Town in the
<font>West Country</font> is good enough: for I'le tell thee, as I heard Squire     
<font>Kites</font> Huntsman say, that he cared not for above three or four
Couple of Hunting Dogs amongst twenty Couple, so they would
give their Tongues and go along with those that were Hunters;
no more do they in the Parliament care whether the greatest part
of their Members have any Wit, or none at all, so that they will
Vote with the Old ones.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, though it was sore against my will, I was    
Press'd
once into the Service when the Duke was our Ambral, and I dare
swear never a man in the Fleet had a better Heart than he.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pox on you Rogue, you staid but one Bout and run
away; but we that staid and were in both the <font>Hollands</font> Wars,
know the Duke well enough; and let them do what they will at
<font>Westminster</font> , I am sure all the Seamen and Watermen in <font>England</font>
will be for him against any Body but the King, God bless him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I am sure he'll never be a Rebel, as many of   
those
that are his Enemies have been.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Rebel! they would like him better if he would stand
in the Kings Face and do what he pleased, whether the King
pleased or not; do'st not see how they love <font>D. M.</font> for coming
home whether the King would or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I hope to see the Duke at <font>Oxford</font> , and   
there he will 
be welcome, I dare say, let <font>London</font> and the Devil say what they
will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For <font>London</font> , surely it is not <font>London</font> that  
does all these ill
things you talk of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art in the right of that, for I never heard   
that the
Houses met together to Petition or raise Tumults, there's no fault
in the place; 'tis some roguish People that lives in it, whom 
nothing vvill ever make better Subjects than they have been: I have
knovvn them long enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But prethee <font>Will</font> , go on vvith thy Story.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Novv I think on't, I should have told you, that I 
am
novv going to say, first of all, that is, vvhat they vvould have
<pagebreak id="9" />
done about the Church; for I have heard the Church should take
place of both the King and the Duke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, but not of the Law, for I know a Wise man as   
any
in <font>Buckinghamshire</font> , an Attorney, that says, That the Law was
above both Church and King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then, according to that Rule, I should first  
have
begun with the Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter, amongst us we are not so punctual, go on,
now thy hand is in, with the Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for the Church, I carried a Member up to       
<font>Putney</font> , and
he told me, they had resolv'd to Overhall all the Nine and 
Thirty <font>Conditions</font> of the Church, and that they had already heaved
away Three and a half of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Belike, if they had gone on, they would have hove   
away
most of them; Three and a half in one day was a great step.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I do'nt believe they would have hove them all  
away, 
but they would quite have new moulded them so, that one should
scarce have known them. Ha'nt I seen an old Ship that has been
a long time at Sea, when she has been in the Dock, her Rigging
Overhall'd and Tarr'd, new Painted, Carved and Guilt, a man
that has sayled in her, could scarce have known her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art in the right of that, and I do believe     
that the
Church was grown very old and much decay'd, and had need of
repairing, and it will never be done but by a Parliament. I was
at <font>Uxbridge</font> last Saboath-day, and there at the Meeting the 
Minister said, That the best Church in the World should be repaired
once in a hundred years; and that the Church we now have, was
repaired (but he had another Word for it) about a Hundred and
Forty or Fifty years since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it not <font>Reformed</font> ? the Scholars at           
<font>Oxford</font> talk much
of that <font>Reformation</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Ay, it was <font>Reformed</font> , that he said; and    
that the
Church (but more especially the Church-men) should be 
Reform'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Besides, this Member told me, the Parsons must    
use the
<font>Surplice</font> no more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was only for the good of the <font>Woollen         
Manufacture</font> . I
carried a Clothier over the Ferry not long since, that said they were
<pagebreak id="10" />
hereafter to wear <font>Flannel</font> Surplices, and the Bishops were to wear
white <font>Crape</font> , in stead of Lawn Sleeves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then for the Bishops Courts, that as we call  
the
Bawdy-Court, they would have mauled those Rogues to some
purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Pox on 'em, they made me pay above five Pounds
about a Bastard, a Whore laid to me, that a Scholar of <font>Oxford</font>
got, I dare say; for I kept reckning, and the Child was got when
I was gone down with the Barge to <font>London</font> ; and for want of a
Flash, we lay above ten Weeks before we came again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seems thou diserved'st for it however.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That which troubled me most, was, that I must have 
done
Penance in a White Sheet, and then my Wife and all my Friends
would have known it; and so saith, I was forced to borrow 
the Moneys, and make my Peace with them: And after all,
they would have had Ten Shillings more for a piece of 
Parchment no bigger than my Hand: I was e'en glad to pay them a
Noble get clear of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As far as I could understand, they would have taken
these Courts away, and have made the Bishops poor 
Gentlemen: They would have clipt their Wings, if not quite slaved
them. O this Member, as we passed by <font>Lambath-House</font> , shaked
his Head at it, and said, There were Raggs of Popery kept
there; and so did he at <font>Fulham</font> , when I landed him at 
<font>Putney</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he mean by that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, the Arch-Bishop of <font>Canterbury</font> lives at    
<font>Lambeth</font> ,
and the Bishop of <font>London</font> hath a Countrey-House at <font>Fulham</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but <font>Will.</font> Thou said'st, they would also  
have had
a Fling at the Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For any thing of the Law it self, I heard not so  
much
of it; but they were in hand, to have reckoned with almost all
the <font>Judges</font> in <font>Westminster Hall</font> , some for one Fault, and some
for others.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What had the Judges done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whether they had strained a Pin, to do something 
extraordinary for the King and the Court, I know not; but the
main matter was, that most of the Talkative Men of the House,
<pagebreak id="11" />
were Lawyers, and the only way for them to get Preferment,
was by turning out of the <font>Judges</font> , that they might get into their
Places.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think in my very Conscience, these Lawyers are   
the
Bain of the Kingdom: For they are so accustomed to talk against
their Consciences for Moneys, at <font>Westminster Hall</font> , that when
they come to talk in the House, it is the same thing: So that
whatever they think for their Advantage, they never want broad
Consciences, nor smooth Tongues, to drive on to the 
utmost. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray thee <font>Will.</font> tell me one thing, are not these
Lawyers the Men, that either doe, or should understand the Law?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then, when the Rebellion was begun, and       
carried
on in our King's Father's Time, and in his own, did not the
Lawyers know, that the War was contrary to the Law?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then do I say, That as many Lawyers as Sided with
the Rebells in those days, deserve yet to be Hanged for what
they did then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O! but they were wise enough for that: For they got
the Act of Oblivion, to pardon, not only their Faults 
by-passed, but those that were to come; and abundance of those 
very Men that talked the People into that Rebellion, are yet 
living, and as willing to do Mischief, as ever they were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It goes beyond my Understanding, how, and why they
are admitted to abuse the People at this rate: For if they can
set poor ignorant Men on a Mischief, for which they may be 
Hanged, and can talk themselves off again, it is time for poor men
to have a Care.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am of this mind, that had I been the King's     
Advisar,
when he forgave all the Rebells, I would not have forgiven one
Lawyer; for they could not plead Ignorance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And that it was a Rebellion is clear: For if it    
had not
been, what need was there of an Act of <font>Oblivion</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art in the Right of that too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing troubles me so much, as that these Lawyers,
are not only Lawyers to follow and maintain the Law; but
<pagebreak id="12" />
they can make what they will to be Law, and what they like not
to be no Law: Nay, they will hang the Honestest man in 
<font>England</font> , and find Law for it; and save the greatest Knave, and  
find
Law for that too.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not Judge <font>Bradshaw</font> pronounce Sentence       
against
<font>King Charles</font> , and <font>Coke</font> plead against him? And both these    
were
great Lawyers: Nay, an a bungling Lawyer, that is a Justice of
the Peace, at the Quarter Sessions, will take upon him to talk
more than all the Bench, and be very angry at any Justice that
dares oppose any thing he says.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is reason for that: For there is not one    
Lawyer of   
twenty, but is certainly bribed (tho' they call it feed) of one
Party in all Controversies, at the Sessions, and frequently by both.
O they make great Gains at a Sessions; for there they are both
<font>Judge</font> and <font>Lawyer</font> . and all goes as they will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell thee, for that I had a wrangling Quarrel 
once
with a Drunken Fellow at the Ferry; and upon some Words,
I up with the Boat-hook, and broke his Head. He went and
fetched a Warrant for me: I was advised to go my self to the
same Justice, being a <font>Lawyer</font> , and bind my self over: Which I
did, and would have given his Worship an Angel; for so my
Friend advised me: He said, he would take no Moneys upon
that Account: For indeed, it seemed, he had taken before from
my Adversary; but he said, if I would give any thing to his
Wife, I might: Upon which, I sent a fat Wether, worth a
Mark, in the Night time to her Worship; and within two days,
both he and I were sent for, before Mr. Justice; and after he had
talked a great deal of Law, and seemed angry with us both,
he made us good friends, and got both our Moneys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There may a thousand Stories be told of them: I   
hope
at one time, both the King and the Kingdom will see what they
are, and never let them have more to do, than with matters of
Law; and then those that employ them may take the mends in
their own Hands, as I do, when I go to the Alehouse: for all
mischief principally comes from them.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Pox and Plague light on 'em, they will never be
quelled: For they have always either one or other great 
Lawyer in Power with the King, and that keeps them up: So let us
<pagebreak id="13" />
talk no more of them. What did the Parliament next fall 
upon, honest <font>Will.</font> thou hast a pure Memory?
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They would have banished a plain bundance of 
Courtiers and Privy-Counsellors; and without any more ado, sent to
the King to desire him (they called it Humbly) to turn them
out of his Service.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did they tell any good Cause, why they would   
have  
him turn them away?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None at all, but because they liked them not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was an humble Trick indeed; but sure they had
some Reason for what they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For no reason, but because they were in Favor     
with the
King, and themselves would have their Places: Nay, there be
some of those men they complained of, were as ready to complain
of those were in place before, such as the last Treasurer, and the
like, as these are now against those they would have now turned
off: for in all this Parliament, Doings, and Peaching one 
another, it is not for Faults done against the King, or the 
Government, but against the House of Commons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I hope these Noble Men are not turned out of   
their
Services, are they?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they have scaped this Bout; how they will do  
at
the next at <font>Oxford</font> , time will shew.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If they scaped at <font>London</font> , I'll warrant them at 
<font>Oxford</font> ,
no man is Condemned there, but he has (as the Scholars call it)
<font>pro</font> and <font>con</font> for it: But vvas that all their Faults, that     
they vvere
in Favor vvith His Majesty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God help thee, do'st not thou knovv, that it is a 
sufficient <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: suffiicent</comment>
Parliament-Crime to be a Favorite. I have heard my Father
say, that he wore the Old Duke of <font>Buckingham's</font> Cloth, and was
Master of his Barge; and that there was one Parliament before I
was born, would have hanged him; but the Devil a Fault could
they find, but his being in mighty Favor. So the King would
not let him suffer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But they put away my Lord <font>Strafford</font> , I can    
remember,
that my self, and they say, because they could find no Law to 
condemn him, they made a Law.
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So then, he suffered for breaking a Law before it  
was made.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So he did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is as much as to say, that if the Parliament  
have
mind to hang a Man, or undo him, if they have not sufficient 
Law or Matter to do it, they will make some: God bless me
and mine out of their Clutches.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I have heard, they were so Civil, as when they
made this Law against the Earl of <font>Strafford</font> , they then made it
so, that no more should suffer by the same Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was very kindly done to him indeed: I would
rather, if I had been in his Cloaths, they would have saved me,
and hanged who they would beside.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This shews plainly they had a particular Malice;  
and
then down a must go, right or wrong: There are some of those
Old Dogs yet alive that hunted him to Death, and would 
as willingly give their Mouth for making away more 
Noblemen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard many say, the King repented himself at
<font>Oxford</font> , that he consented to the Earl's Death.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But those Rogues that procured his Death, never 
repented at all, nor does not do yet: Nay, they have tought some
young Whelps to be as good Blood-Hounds as themselves. A
Man has a brave time that should come to be tryed for his Life
in any Court, and have half a dozen of these to chase him out
of the World.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis strange the Noble-men does not stand for one 
another against those Lawyers, who, if they might have their Wills,
would hang them all: Especially, being there is no body of the
Jury, when the Lords are to be tryed, but Lords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They had such a Power when my Lord <font>Strafford</font>  
was
Headed, that neither the King, nor the Lords, durst stand against
them: They made Routs of Prentices to run down to 
<font>Westminster</font> , and call out for Justice, and threaten all those   
Lords that
would have saved him; and in the end they had his Blood.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard many say, that there were very few of  
those  
many that prosecuted the Earl; but they were after Ring-leaders
in the Rebellion against the King, and continued so to his Death,
<pagebreak id="15" />
as violent against him, as they were against the Earl, and against
our King that now is (God bless him) till the Souldiers and
Seamen joyned with <font>Monk</font> to bring him in again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet I'll warrant thee, these were as ready to 
welcome Home his Majesty, and make shew of their Duty and 
Affection to him, as his best Friends.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, and pretended they had as much a Hand in his 
Restoration, as the General that brought him in; and talked 
themselves, not only out of the Faults they had committed; but by
Bribery, and means of some Lawyers, that had been Abroad
with the King, they got suddainly into such Favor, that a
Round-Headed Lawyer had more Power than a Cavalier 
Colonel that fought for the King all through the War: And so they
have carried it ever since: And now thou may'st see what they
have brought it unto, at long run: For nothing but the Ruine
and Death of a great Number of the King's Courtiers and 
Counsellors will please them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They will not stay there if they have leave to go  
on:
The Old Game must be play'd over again; but I hope the King's
calling them at our Town of <font>Oxford</font> , will mend this matter:
For I have heard hundreds say, that if his Father had called the
<font>Rump</font> Parliament thither, instead of <font>Westminster</font> , there had  
not
been so much Mischief done as there was: But pray thee <font>Will.</font>
was this all they did?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This, no, not the hundred part: For any one Man's
Fault or Suspicion, that he was against them, they would have
ruin'd a whole Countrey. There was a <font>Welsh</font> Noble-man, I
know not his Name, that they had a Spite to, that was Steward 
of a great <font>Wapentake-Court</font> <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT ONLY ITALICISES         
Wapentake</comment> in <font>Wales</font> ; and out of Malice to him,
they would have taken that Court away, tho' it was a great 
Benefit to all that Quarter of the Country: Nay, there was one
day a Member, so angry at a Waterman, for asking an unusual
Fare, for bringing him from some place, in the <font>West-Country</font>      
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT ONLY ITALICISES West</comment> ,
that he said, he would have a Bill brought into the House, for
his sake, to restrain the Numbers of Watermen; and that all
the Wherries that go upon the River, should be forced to take 
a Licence, and should be Figured on the Back-Board, as the 
Hackney Coaches are. Upon which, the Waterman civilly reply'd,
<pagebreak id="16" />
That <font>God bless the King</font> , he hoped that being a Freeman of 
<font>Waterman's Hall</font> , they could never make him take a Licence:
with that the Member said, Sirra, for your sake, and such 
sawcy Rogues as you are, we will have that <font>Watermans-Hall</font> 
pulled down, as well as vve have pulled dovvn the Court of the
<font>Marshes</font> of <font>VVales</font> : That vvas the Court I vvas talking of.
  </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope thou heard'st them say nothing of the        
<font>VVestern</font>  
Barges <font>VVill.</font> did'st thou?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Hang you, you are belovv their Consideration;
but they talked much about Seamen, and the Fleet, and against
Souldiers: And then for the Papists, they vvould have utterly
destroyed them; and no great matter if they had; for those
Rogues have been the occasion of all this Poder, has been even
since the Beginning of these Times: And they say, they Fired
the City, and brought the Plague out of <font>France</font> , and set it 
amongst us at <font>London</font> . 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How should that be? For vvhen the Visitation began
at <font>London</font> , I heard of no Plague in <font>France</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I heard a Doctor, one of the Royal Society,  
say,
as I carried him once, There be Rogues that vvill bring Bottles
of Infected Air vvith them, if it were out of <font>Turkey</font> , that as   
soon
as they are opened, vvill infect a whole House; then they take 
an Antilop, that no Infection can touch themselves: And that
some Papists did this, I have heard a Justice in the City took
Examinations upon it, and it was proved.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what would they have done against the          
<font>Presbyterians,
Independants, Anabaptists</font> , and <font>Quakers</font> : The Scholars at      
<font>Oxford</font> ,
say, those are as great Enemies to the Church and the University
as the Papists.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They would have made them as good Protestants as 
any
is in <font>Oxford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which way must this have been?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, they would have made the Church-men have
left out some of their Prayers, and given over the Surplice, and
some other Popish Tricks; and then they would have come to
Church, and been all one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is, the Church-men must have become 
<font>Presbyterians</font> , and then all would have been right.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, I think they would not have yielded much
to the Bishops: For they were bloody mad at them; and I think
if they had sitten till now, they would have sent them to the
Church from the House, to pray to God; but not to have letten
them prate any more to the House of Lords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It will be good for them to talk no such Talk at   
<font>Oxford</font> ,
the Bishops are in great Power amongst the Scholars.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then as to their own Members, they turned them out,
and took others in at their will and pleasure; and if they made
any Fault, they expelled them; and wherever any stood in 
Competition for any Town, him they knew, would give his Vote along
with them was admitted, right or wrong: And then they 
terrified all the Sherriffs, Mayors and Bailiffs in the Kingdom,     
besides 
abundance of Gentlemen, and other honest Country-men: For
on the least Complaint of any Man's misdemeanor, or 
Information from any Member, immediately a Serjeant at Arms was
sent for them, and so much a Mile, and Hour paid, and down
on their Mary-bones to their Worships, and a sound Scolding
from Mr. Speaker; or else to the Tower, or the Gate-House
they went: The King, God bless him, never took a quarter
of that State on him they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It seems they would have all the World to ask them
Forgiveness, whether they made them any Fault or not; and
they themselves would ask no body Pardon for what they had
done.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was brought to that pass, that two Foot-boys, 
Boxing one day in the Palace Yard, he that was beaten, proved to
belong to a Member, and told the other Boy, if he knew his
Master, he would cause him to be sent for in Custody, for 
keeping such a Rogue as he was, that had committed a Breach of
Priviledge, in beating a Member's Servant. The Boy replied, if
it would do him any Kindness, he would beat him again, and
tell him his Master's Name into the Bargain; and would lay
him a Crown, that tho' his Master should bid the Speaker, and
all the House of Commons kiss his -- they durst not
send a Serjeant at Arms for him. The beaten Boy much netled
at his Speech, laid down his money, as the other did. Now,
said the Boy, my Master is the King of <font>France</font> , and I am come 
<pagebreak id="18" />
over with some of his Servants, to fetch Horses out of <font>England</font> :
Go bid thy Master, and the House of Commons send a Serjeant
at Arms to fetch him over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before my Heart, is was a good Answer: I hope he won 
his Moneys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So he did; but it was put into a Waterman's Hands,
and when it was demanded, says the Beaten Boy, Sirrah, give
it him if you dare, if his Master be the King of <font>France</font> , I'll   
make
you answer it before the House of Commons. The Waterman
durst do no other but give either their own Moneys: There is 
no contending with Parliament Men, or Parliament Men's Men,
nor Boys.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet I know a Bayliff has nabbed several of them,
and matters not a Straw to arreast any Member of the last 
Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's nothing, they are now no Parliament-men; but
let's see if that Stout Fellow dare nabb any of them when they
are new chosen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I don't know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O those that are in any danger of Bayliffs, are    
mighty
cunning at their Times, and know their Hits to a Minute; they
appear abroad at <font>London</font> a certain Number of days before the 
Sitting of the House, as sure as Swallows against warm Weather;
and after the Sessions they are <font>Presto, begon</font> , not one to be    
seen:
except it be that we chance to carry them by Water from the
Temple or <font>White-Friars</font> , to <font>Scotland-Yard</font> ; they have a strong
Garrison in either of those Places out of Priviledge time, as they
call it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but pray thee <font>Will.</font> let us have it all   
out what
they did.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is impossible as I told thee, For me to tell a 
quarter
what they did; they stopped <font>Irish, Scotch</font> , and <font>Welch</font> Cattel 
from
coming to the City, and Pork, Mutton, Veal and Lamb, from any
of those Places; and it was said, if they had sate long enough,
they would have stopped <font>Essex Calves</font> , and <font>Hampshire Hogs</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet the City still doats upon these Parliaments.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, they would have made such Laws about wearing
of Cloth, and Woollen Stuffs, as would have beggared an
<pagebreak id="19" />
hundred thousand Souls that are Silk-Weavers, Silk-Dyers, and such
like.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What matter they, if they can but find a way to   
make
Acts, to set their Grounds dearer, and rack their poor Tenants,
they care not if half of the Kingdom starve.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And yet they talk so much for the General Good, and 
against the absolute Power of the King and the Court, how can
they make this out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They call that Power which they themselves both do
act by, and would govern all by, the Liberty of the Subject, tho'
no Subject, but a few Members have any Liberty at all: But if his
Majesty, God bless him, should act by the same Power, and do
the same things which they do; then they call the very same
Power flat down-right Tyranny.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do'st not thee remember, <font>Will.</font> one day the last
Summer, when our Barge lay against <font>York</font> Stairs, there was a great
Noise about the Head Bayliff of <font>Westminster</font> , breaking into an
Embassenders House, to seize upon some Goods which belonged
to a Man was condemned to be Hanged at <font>Tyburn</font> ; and upon
Complaint of the Embassender to the King, the said Bailiff was 
taken and clapt into the Tower; and every body said, he would
be hanged at the least, for breaking the Common Law of all 
Nations: But the next News we heard, was, that he had got some
sort of a Warrant, was made by the Long Parliament, that set
him at Liberty within three Hours after he was committed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember the time very well, they call those
Warrants <font>Habeas Corpuses</font> , and they will fetch a Prisoner 
committed by the King, out of any Goal in <font>England</font> ; but not one
Committed by the House of Commons: And this they call 
Priviledge of Parliament.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All these Gentlemen that were fetched up by        
Messengers
and Serjeants, they might by the Common Law have chosen
whether they would have come or not. There was a Knight in
our County at <font>Oxford</font> , that was sent for by a Messenger, and
he told the Messenger, he had something else to do, and would
not come, and said he would justifie it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely this was just about the time they were     
Dissolv'd,
otherwise he durst not have been so bold.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said he had been a Member himself many Years, and
knew no Law to compell any Man to come before the House of 
Commons, unless they had a mind themselves; and therefore
they sent to the King, to get his Majesty's Proclamation, to fetch
him before them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So then His Majesty's Proclamation, issued out at 
the
desire of the Commons, is of Force; but when sent out by 
himself is worth nothing at all. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because I remember there were several sent for in 
Custody, for obeying the King's Proclamation against Petitions, and
brought to their Knees: If therefore that had been a good 
Proclamation, why should any body have suffer'd for it? And for
any thing I know, if his Majesty should have made a 
Proclamation to fetch up that Knight, or any body disobeyed their 
Messenger, it had deserved as much to have been disobeyed as that 
about Petitions, unless the House of Commons can make a 
Proclamation, contrary to Law, a good one, as this would have been:
For, what need had they of the King's Proclamation, if there had
been Law to have fetched those men before them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now if those Men were fetched up, did dare to sue,
and the Lawyers did dare to do their Office, and the Judges did
dare to give Judgment, I am of Opinion they might bring 
Actions of false Imprisonment against the Messengers that fetched
them up: For if they had not full Power to punish those who
did not obey them, then surely those who were fetched had
wrong done them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I dare assure thee, neither Lawyer nor Judge   
dare
meddle with any such matter: If any of these Gentlemen would
be so ventersome, they will find no Law to stand against the 
Votes of the Commons, till they find they are as much brought
under, as they say <font>Harry the Eighth</font> brought them; they durst
not prate in his Days, as now they do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard a Fellow of <font>Maudlin Colledge</font> ,    
say, he
tumbled them, and made them do what he would himself,
and not what they had a mind to; and not a word of Tyranny
or Arbitrary Power.
<pagebreak id="21" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But pray thee <font>Will.</font> some more of their Doings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have told thee it is without end; and therefore 
I will   
tell thee the last thing they did, which was, they Voted, that
if any man advised his Majesty to Prorogue them upon any 
Account but to disinherit the Duke, he was an Enemy to the King
and Kingdom: Nay, he was a Pensioner to the <font>French</font> King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, whether he ever received any Money from the
<font>French</font> King or not?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, though he never received Penny of Mony from   
him,
or any body else by his means or order.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For any thing I know, they might as well have said,
that he had been my Lord Mayor's Bull-rider: I have often heard
say, that a Parliament can make a Man into a Woman; and now
I see, they can make a man into a Pensioner of <font>France</font> tho' he be
none. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What then was done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That very day, notwithstanding all this, they were
Prorogued.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then surely, they will say, either they were       
Prorogued
by the Advice of some Body, who, for that Advice, are 
Pensioners; or if his Majesty Prorogued them on his ovvn Head, then
they vvill think, tho' they dare not say, that he himself is a 
Pensioner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And vvithin fevv days after they vvere Dissolved, 
and 
ather order'd to be called at your Tovvn of <font>Oxford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, for all that <font>Sam's</font> Parson said, There    
vvas a
Parliament called at <font>Oxford</font> , that vvas called the mad Parliament,
yet vvill I be hang'd, if ever that vvas half so mad as this thou
hast told us of: For according to thy Tale, this Parliament let
nothing 'scape them; to his Majesty they vvould have given 
nothing, nor let any body lend him any thing; but vvould get
from him vvhat they could: From the Duke they vvould have
taken his Birth-right; the Church and Religion they vvould have
cast in nevv Mould; the Bishops and Clerks, they vvould have
nevv-fashioned, if not utterly laid aside, banished many of the 
Nobles, taught the Judges of <font>Westminster-Hall</font> nevv Lavvs,
and made them pay for practising the Old, terrified most of the
Loyal Gentry of the Kingdom, vvith Serjeants, Messengers, and
<pagebreak id="22" />
Expensive Journeys, the same with Mayors, Sheriffs and Bayliffs,
Fault or no Fault, taken away Courts and Priviledges from 
several Shires, to their great harm, to revenge themselves of 
particular men; not only hinder'd <font>Irish</font> Cattel, and other        
Provisions,
from the City, but Beggar'd many thousands of Families of 
Silk-Weavers, and other poor Handicrafts-men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, these very Men were got to that Height, they
would have abused any Body they met with, Gentle or Simple,
not paid a Farthing for crossing the Ferry, but said, they were
<font>Franke</font> in Parliament-time, as their Masters Letters were at the
Post-house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was not this then as mad a Parliament, as that 
Parliament they talk on at our Town? If this next prove a 
madder than the last, if it sit at our Town, I'll give any man leave
to hang me at the Mast of my Barge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For all this, I believe they will not sit at       
<font>Oxford</font> : for
they say, a many Noblemen have Petitioned the King's Majesty
against it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I can tell thee, his Majesty said, they       
should Sit at
<font>Oxford</font> for all that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray thee, who were these Noblemen that 
Petitioned?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell thee who they were by their Names;  
but
he that was the Rump's first General delivered it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He! thou art a Fool <font>Will.</font> he is dead at least  
thirty years
since: I remember I have seen him, as if he had been alive, in a
Buff Coat, amongst the Tombs at <font>Westminster</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I am sure he bears the same Name, and       
probably
it may be his Son; for this man follows that man's Steps: Then
there was him that was General of the Horse to the Rump, that
I am sure is the very Man himself, and another Lord that sate in the
Rump House of Commons, with a Blew Garter about him, a
thing was never done before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That cannot be, I remember that Lord my self, he   
is dead,
I am confident.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It may be then it was his Son; there was besides  
another,
whose Father some say Beheaded the King; but if he did not, 'tis
certain he was in Disguise on the Scaffold: And then he that set
<pagebreak id="23" />
them on all this, as it is talked, is a little, lame, purblind Lord, 
that
has been a Man in all the Times ever since the first Rebellion, and
still turned time enough to save himself, though others were 
Hanged for the same Fact: He now sets them upon all the Mischiefs
done, and if he live to it, will leave them in the Lurch.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's Old usual with him, and yet he's no better  
than
those that stood it out to the last, and deserved Hemp many a fair
Year since.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He'll come to it yet; for all his Cunning, the    
Devil will
cozen him at last: All the rest were Covenanters, or their Sons,
except one or two disguised Lords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope his Majesty will remember what these men did
with his Father, and not be advised by any such.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, when all this is said, I am still of Opinion
<font>London</font> is the fittest place in the Kingdom for a Parliament; for
there every Body finds their Conveniency: His Majesty his House
at <font>Whitehall</font> , the Nobles their own Houses, the Members 
convenient <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: convevenient</comment> Accommodation of Lodging,   
and every Body their
Ease.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I question whether too much Conveniency for 
Parliaments be not hurtful to Business: For when they are less 
commodiously served, they will mind their Business the better, and
make more haste with their Work, that they may get so much
sooner home: Not but that I know, they may have all 
Conveniencies at our Town, and sufficient Accommodation for all the
Followers of a Parliament that are requisite to attend it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The plain truth is, there are now-a-days          
abundance of
People do follow Parliaments, over what there used to be in 
former Times, as I have heard People say: And this <font>London</font> has
such New Buildings, that it lodges them all conveniently, if they
were five times as many.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou art in the right of it <font>Will.</font> that there   
does more
People follow the Parliaments a late time, than formerly, that is,
the Scoundrel Rabble of <font>London</font> , who are ready, and have been
this Forty Years to back any Seditious Petition; and to come
down to <font>Westminster</font> and <font>Whitehall</font> , like a Land-flood in our 
River,
that threatens all the Countrey: These encouraged by 
Discontented Members, when they cannot get the Lords to joyn in
<pagebreak id="24" />
their <comment type="compiler">CATCHWORD their ON PRECEDING PAGE MISSING ON PAGE 24</comment>       
malitious Acts, threaten no less now, than they did to his 
Majesty's Father, God bless him: And I think it no great loss if     
these
Gentlemen be left at Home to mind their Trades at <font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But the Scholars of <font>Oxford</font> , are thought, by   
many, will
be as unmannerly as the Prentices in <font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell thee <font>Sam.</font> if the Parliament will     
behave 
themselves as they ought, to the King's Majesty, and the Royal Line,
and offer no Injury to the Church, Bishops, Clergy, University,
nor Scholars, and give the King his reasonable Requests, I'll
warrant thee, the Scholars will be as civil as can be; but by my
Faith, if they find either the Church, or themselves touched
upon, it will be a hard matter to rule them: They are like 
Seamen, one and all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Still I am for Old <font>London</font> , thou knowest the   
King has
borrowed many Hundred Thousand Pounds of the City and the
<font>East-India</font> Company, and never needed to want Moneys for a
fair word to the City.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It's very true; but he always paid double Interest 
for
what he had of them: So that it was a greater Courtesie to the
City, to lend it, than to the King to have the Loan. But now that
Business is over, they will lend no more Money, but upon 
Parliament-Security: Had they continued to have been the same City
they were in 1660, and some Years after, I believ the King would 
never have removed the Parliament to <font>Oxford</font> ; but since they now
are become that City they were in 1640. I think the King does
wiser to remove the Parliament to <font>Oxford</font> , that True, Loyal 
City, where every man loves the Name of the King, and that 
shewed so much Fidelity to his Father: Then let the Parliament and
the Factious City of <font>London</font> send him to <font>Oxford</font> as they did   
his
Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then let us all go to <font>Oxford</font> , and pray for  
the good 
Success of this Parliament.

AND 
<font>TOM.</font> THE BARGEMAN OF <font>OXFORD</font> ; 
UPON THE COMING OF THE TWO LAST DOWN 
THE RIVER, FROM 
OXFORD.</head> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How does all our Friends at the Court at 
<font>Oxford</font> ? 'Tis strange, <font>Will.</font> thou shouldst come 
again so soon!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou knowest, I told thee, I mostly
follow the Court; and 'faith, at this time, he had been a 
cunning man that had gone before it; his Majesty gave not so good 
warning of his Return to <font>London</font> , as he did of his going to
<font>Oxford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what says <font>Tom.</font> now to his mad Parliament?  
I hope
he has no reason to complain of this Parliament.
<pagebreak id="26" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But the Town of <font>Oxford</font> will have reason to     
complain 
while they live: But the best on't is, some <font>Londoners</font> will have
Houses to set in <font>Oxford</font> , at as good Rates as they took them:
Had his Majesty made a Cocking, or a Hunting-Match at <font>Oxford</font> ,
he had done it a better Turn, than to have brought such Guests
as these were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I heard some say, they were so mad they were      
called
from <font>London</font> , that they resolved to do something at <font>Oxford</font> ,
should make them be suddainly sent away again; and so bilk the
Town of their Expectation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They say the Town much matter'd not the Court, and
the Mayor, and the Aldermen of <font>Oxford</font> , were as much against
it as the Common Council is at <font>London</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, that is because the University is so much for   
the
King, God Bless him, and his Houshold: For this is a certain
Rule, if the University be for the Court, the Town will be for
the Country, as they call it: Nay, if the University be for 
Jesus Christ, the Town holds themselves obliged in Conscience to
be for the Devil.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But still <font>Tom.</font> this does not answer what thou  
said'st of 
this Parliament, which thou would'st a warrant would do such
brave things, if they sate at <font>Oxford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must confess I was mistaken, as my Father was    
before
me: For he took once a <font>London</font> Boy to be his Prentice; and
tho' he knew him to be a little light-finger'd, and given to 
Lying and Swearing, yet he hoped if he could get him to <font>Oxford</font> ,
he could cure him; and took infinite Care and Pains about him,
and daily told him what would be the end of him, if he would
not lay aside his <font>London</font> Tricks, and become a down-right,
honest <font>Oxford</font> Bargeman; but all in vain, what was bred in the
Bone, would never out of the Flesh: He fell by little and little, to
down-right Thieving, and Hang'd he was in the End; and as
my Father afterwards learned, the Rogue's Father and 
Grand-father, and many of his Kindred had been Thieves before him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What's all this to the Purpose, what have either  
we or
the Parliament to do with thy Father or his Thievish Prentice?
He was not the first Bargeman by a hundred, that have been
Hang'd.
<pagebreak id="27" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well said <font>Will.</font> here's a precious Story        
indeed, and 
nothing to the Purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You don't know the meaning, I perceive, of a       
Parable,
or an <font>Aesop's Fable</font> ; when ye have taught these Shavers at 
<font>London</font> , with your Rehearsals, and at <font>Westminster</font> , with     
their Votes,
Resolves and Stories, to nose their Master, and abuse their 
Fellows, then you send 'em down to <font>Oxford</font> , to be cured of the
R-- When 'tis too late they are no more be reclaimed than a
Sheep-Worrier; nor will any thing cure them, but that which
cured my Father's Prentice: Now there's the precious Story you
talked of so much. And yet for all this, you cannot dash us in
the Teeth with any <font>Oxford</font> Acts of Parliament: Had their 
Noses been kept to the Grindle-stone as close at <font>Westminster</font> ,   
as it was
at <font>Oxford</font> , they would not have been so high in the In-step. I
was sure, if they sate at <font>Oxford</font> , they must either make good    
Acts,
or none at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A will have it one way or other; these <font>Oxford</font>  
Rogues 
learn to wrangle of the Boys, and will never yield Right or 
Wrong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but for all his Bragging, there was that    
done at
this Parliament at <font>Oxford</font> , was never done at <font>Westminster</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray thee what was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There was as near a Lye, not to be the           
down-right Lye,
given to the King, as Heart could think.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How so man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>VVill.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell thee, for Example sake, If I should    
say, it is an
unwarrantable thing for any man to pull down <font>Windsor</font> great Park
Pail, and ride through to <font>Bagshot</font> Market, if thou sayest this is a
warrantable Trick, tho' all the World knew the contrary, do'st
not thee come very near to give me the Lye, what thinkest
thou by this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely he that did this, had his Breeding at       
<font>Billingsgate</font> , 
or at <font>Hog Norton</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But if he had a foul Tongue, he had a good pair of 
Heels,
for he gave Ground a Hundred miles, in a very few Hours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That was but to be out of the way while the thing 
was
hot, it will quickly be forgot I'll warrant thee, once in a short
time, I shall see this very man come in his Coach to <font>Westminster</font>
<pagebreak id="28" />
<font>Hall</font> , with a Quoif on, if not a Red Gown. Such mannerly
Behavior as this, has been an only way to Preferment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I think he better deserves to go up            
<font>Holborn</font> in a Wooden
Chariot, and have a Horse Night-Cap put on at the farther
end.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These kind of People do no more matter what they  
say,
than a Dog does that has stolen a joint of meat from the Cook:
they only run away for a while, and when they think all's quiet
and forgotten, then they come again with as much Confidence,
as if they had never done no mischief at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The reason of this is, because they never light of 
the
Whip for their Roguery, and so scaping Scot-free, makes them
so bold.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Ay, let a man suffer a Prentice to prate and  
talk, 
and the next, he gives you two words for one; and then, if you
offer to correct him, have at your Ears, Black <font>Tom.</font> of            
<font>Lambath</font> ,
that was an honest, good Fellow, as ever took an Oar by the
end, suffered his Prentice so long, that when he would have 
corrected him, it was too late; and being a lusty young Rogue, he
threw him o're Board into the <font>Thames</font> ; and had not I come by,
by chance, he had been drown'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, nothing madded me so much, as that the House 
of Commons praised this Fellow, and order'd him Thanks for
his Complement he made.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O brave <font>Oxford</font> still; for at                  
<font>Westminster</font> , they always
used to have so much good manners, as to give his Majesty Thanks
for his Speech, whether it pleased them or not; and now they
thank a man that gives him the Lye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But pray, my Masters, what did they do that little
time they sate; or, at least-wise what would they have done?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell thee, thou sayest, the Parson told thee  
of a 
Parliament once at <font>Oxford</font> , was called the <font>Mad Parliament</font> ;  
I think
this may be called the <font>Foolish</font> and <font>K--vish</font> Parliament: They
were in hand to make such a King of the Duke, if he should
have Survived his Brother, as thou never heard'st of in thy
life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A King, why, the <font>Portingals</font> King, that they   
keep a
Close Prisoner, in an Old Castle, at the Rock of <font>Lisbon</font> , is an
<pagebreak id="29" />
Emperor in Comparison of that they would have made him: A
must have had the Name of a King, but none of the Power;
nor have lived in any of his Dominions, or within 500 Miles.
Would not this have been a brave King?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray thee tell me, what have they to do with       
<font>Scotland</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With <font>Scotland</font> ? O, they make a good Title to   
<font>Scotland</font> :
For <font>Oliver</font> Conquer'd it for the <font>Rump</font> , and these being the   
<font>Rump's</font>
Heir's, they think <font>Scotland</font> belongs to them as well as           
<font>England</font> :
For as sure as thou stands there, they keep the Commonwealth's
Title a Foot in their minds, though they dare not publickly own
it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How should that be?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll tell thee, if I have a Crown in my Pocket, and
thou hast a mind to have it from me, there is but three ways to 
get it, either by Slight of Hand, to pick it from me, or by words,
to persuade me out of it, or take it from me by Strong Hand.
Now the first and last not being so convenient nor easy: if thou
canst use Words to make me give it thee, is not that the best
way?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No doubt of it <font>Tom.</font> then Words have prevailed 
a great
way, and will possibly be attempted farther; but if those will
not do, thou knowst what follows next: Besides, it is apparent,
they aimed now to make a Push for a Commonwealth: For they
affronted the King in the first place, as I have told you; then in
the next place, they Voted the Lords Denial to Try <font>Fitz-Harris</font> ,
was a Denial of Justice, and Hinderance of Discovering of the
Popish Plot, and twenty Stories more they called it; which was
as much as to say, they were not fit to sit in that House: For
if they were unjust in their Doings, and countenanced the Popish
Plot, what worse could have been said of them? And if this had
taken, at the next Vote they had been useless, and then welcome
the <font>Rump</font> again; they would only have wanted him that was
Headed at Tower hill Twenty Years ago, what did you call
him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe thou meanest Sir <font>Har. Vain</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Ay, that was he, if he had been alive to have  
joyned with the Purblind Lord, and the Colonell with Cut Fingers,
and a few more, all had been right.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray thee <font>Tom.</font> what would they have done with  
this
<font>Fitz-Harris</font> , what is that Fellow?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Faith, I think no Body knows what he is; but I take  
him to be a Cross-Biter; but if he chance to be Hanged, as he is
like to be, it is doubtful he will be Cross-bitten himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why the Parliament were Bloody mad at him, and
would needs have Hanged him themselves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O <font>Sam.</font> thou knowest not Parliament-Craft, the  
next
way Home, sometimes is the farthest about: If they could have
gotten the Lords to have received the Impeachment against him,
they would have kept him alive, and played more Tricks than
thou can imagine; they would have made him Bowl off and on,
as thou doest at Nine pins; and made his Evidence good and
right in what they had a mind; and errand Lyes in what they
liked not: And he has been as far from Hanging by their
means, as the Lords in the Tower; only they would possibly
have found Law to have Bailed him; which could not be found          
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: fouud</comment>
for the Treasurer <font>Danby</font> , whom they know they have no power
to Hang, unless they do with him, as with the Old Earl of 
<font>Strafford</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But for all their Cunning he may yet come to be 
Hanged; and if he be, stand clear, I believe there will be Stories   
told,
some will not be willing to hear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before my Heart, you two are gotten very cunning at
State Affairs, I believe you did nothing but listen and hearken
after News. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If the Parliament had sate at our Town a           
Twelvemonth,
I would not have wrought in my Barge an Hour; but if ever
Parliament deserved a By-Name, this little <font>Short Ars'd</font> one, 
deserved that I have given it, both for medling with what they
did so simply, and medling with those People and Places out of
their Power.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but now this Parliament is Dissolved, all    
this is over,
and now they have power to Vote, nor Act, nor nothing; neither
and I hope we shall have Quietness, and the Court at <font>Windsor</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It's true, they are unroosted from their Publick   
Sitting  
Places, both at <font>Westminster</font> and <font>Oxford</font> ; but the Men that    
shape
out all the Work are not idle; that will appear e're long in the 
<pagebreak id="31" />
<font>Common Hall</font> of <font>London</font> , and from other places where they have
Power to set Mischief on Foot.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I remember Gaffer <font>Tompson</font> of <font>Abbington</font> ,   
had a Dozen
Men and Boys that laboured his Barge; and to his Cost, he found
they were all plotted together to Rob, Steal, and do him any
Mischief they could: Nay, would almost tell him to his Face,
they would have what they list: He was a Quiet, Honest Man,
and loved not Trouble, and hoped, in vain, for Amendment a long
time; but at last, he took a Resolution, and turned them all off
at once, and got a New Floor full, that knew nothing of the 
Roguery of the other Crew; and then all things went well with 
him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was in the Right of that: For if he had left    
any
of the Old ones in the Barge, they would have corrupted all the
rest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do'st not think, there are some Old <font>Rumpers</font>     
has done
a great hurt amongst the Members?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am for a New Floor full, or none at all;         
there's no
Hopes of any Good from <font>Tompson's</font> Old Crew.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tom.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gaffer <font>Tompson</font> had a special Care, not only to 
keep his
New men from companying with the Old Ones at <font>London</font> and at
<font>Abbington</font> ; but also, that they should not come and Rob him by
Strong Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Will.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They durst hardly do that; for then it had come to
<font>Hangum tuum</font> : However it was Wisdom in him to have an Eye
to them: For they met often together, to consult which way to
be revenged of him; and however he knew the Laws of the Land 
would protect him, vvhich must protect every Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sam.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray <font>God Bless His Majesty</font> , and give him    
Povver to put
his Lavvs in Execution; and then, I think, none but his
