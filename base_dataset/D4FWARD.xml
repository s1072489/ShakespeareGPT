another comes on: For he has now the Pleasure of

<font>Let me have no more Haste than good Speed: Do ye
think I will have my Daughter married in Hugger
<pagebreak id="40" />
mugger? No in good Truth, will not I: I intend she
shall be married like my Child. She shall not come
among the Rabble at</font> Duke's Place: <font>I will have her be
married with a License, and go to the Church from
my House in Coaches, with Bride-men and Bride-maids,
and all that</font> . <font>But must they be married at your
Parish-Church</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth Mrs. <font>Pratewel</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>No by my Truth     
shan't
they</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied the Mother;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that is too near to make
any Show as they ride along: I intend they shall be
married at</font> Bow Church <font>in</font> Cheap-side, <font>that they
may be seen as they ride along: and all the young
VVomen wish themselves in my Daughter's Place that
Night, and all the young Men in my Son-in-laws; by
which the Bride and Bridegroom may reflect upon their
own Happiness</font> . <font>Well, I profess, you are much in the right
of it</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says Mrs. <font>Pratewel</font> :</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I hate these stolen Weddings
mortally; it looks as if Folks were ashamed of what 
they did: And for their hearing the Sighs and VVishes
of the young Gentlemen and Gentlewomen as they pass
along, that was an extraordinary Thought: I wonder
how you came to think of it</font> . <font>Why truly</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the 
Mother,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>it is what I observing at my own VVedding; (for
you must know I was as publickly married, as I intend my
Daughter shall be:) And as we rid along, I heard one
Gentleman say</font> , O that I was to be that
Gentlewoman's Bedfellow to Night! I envy the
Bridegroom's Happiness, <font>says another</font> . I did not care if I
was in the Bride's Place, <font>says a Gentlewoman that knew 
what it was</font> ; for I like the Bridegroom extreamly:
<font>These Things I tell ye, put strange Thoughts in me, that
I could hardly eat my Dinner, for thinking what a
Supper I should have</font> . <font>Truly</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says Mrs. <font>Idlesby</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>you make me almost wish that my Turn were as near as
your Daughter's</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>This Dialogue being over, (which
<pagebreak id="41" />
must needs be very pleasant for a young Man to
hear) Mr. Bridegroom Elect calls for a Bottle of
Canary, with as much Confidence as if he were at
Home, (and indeed so he is in effect) and he finds
an exact Observance paid to what he says; for up
comes the Maid with a Bottle and a Glass in a
Silver Plate, and a Damask Napkin on her Arm;
and presenting him the Glass first, he gives it to
his Mother, who drinks to Mrs. <font>Idlesby</font> , and she
to the young Gentleman; and, as if the Devil was
at the Bottom of the Glass, tosses it all off, because
he would not leave him a Drop: He drinks to Mrs.
<font>Pratewel</font> , and she to the young Lady, who rather
sips than drinks, and so sets down the Glass: And
then having commended to each other their Choice,
the two Visitants take their Leave.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <omission type="line" />

   <nonSpeech>If any further Object, That the elected
Bridemaids do often quarrel and fall out about
Dressing up the Bride-bed: I answer, Those Quarrels
are the greatest pleasures in the VVorld to a young
VVooer, because the Subject-matter of them, is
how they may best accommodate him; by
avoiding of all Reflections; and is indeed a very
comical Scene, as I shall further shew: Sometimes the
Controversie is about the Colour of the Ribbons:
Suppose then that one argues for Yellow very
strongly:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Yellow</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries the adverse party:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>VVhat,
the Colour of Jealousie! That was never known for a
Bride bed before. VVhy, you would not have them 
jealous on the VVedding-night, would ye</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Another
propound Fillamot:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Why, that is worse than the other</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>cries another:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>How ridiculous would that look, to
dress up a Bride-bed with Fading Love</font> ? <font>No, no</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>says another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am for Blue and Green</font> . <font>But why
so pray</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the Third?</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Because</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>answers the Former,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Blue is the Emblem of Constancy, and Green of
Youth; which is youthful Constancy, and I think
very proper</font> . <font>No</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I will tell you what
<pagebreak id="49" />
it shall be: It shall be Blue and Black <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Back</comment> , for  
that shews
Constancy till Death</font> . <font>That is a foolish Fancy indeed</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>says another;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>those Colours will not agree at all; for
Black is a Mourning Colour</font> . <font>Then I think</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says
another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>it must be Blue and Green</font> . <font>Pshaw, Pshaw,
Green it self is but a melancholy <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: melanchloy</comment>        
Colour, and not proper
at a Wedding</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Ah, but I mean Grass
Green</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the last Maid,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>and that shews Mirth and
Jolitry; and so that was pitch'd on for One</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then
another Bride-maid propounded to mix Violet
with it:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Violet</font> ! </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>why that signifies
Religion; and what have young married People to do
with that, when they are in Bed</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Long the Contest
lasted about the <font>Colours</font> , but at last <font>Grass Green</font> and

<comment type="compiler">AN ARGUMENT CONCERNING THE CHOICE OF FAVOURS THEN TAKES PLACE,
WITH THE MILLENER CONDEMNING THE BRIDE AND GROOM'S CHOICE OF GOLD
AND POPPINGAY GREEN, AND IN TURN BEING REBUFFED BY THE OLDER
BRIDESMAID.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>But as to this,
the Millioner met with a Check-mate from the 
elder Bride-maid, who gave him the following
<pagebreak id="50" />
Rebuff:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I say, Poppingay shall stand; for your
Exception against it is nonsensical: For, why should you
go about to exclude Wantonness from new married
People, when it is as natural to them as Milk to a Calf!
I would not give a Half-penny for a young Husband,
that would not be as wanton as a young Colt. And 
therefore Poppingay is a meterial Colour, and shews young
married People what they must do, and so must not be left
out: But as for Gold Colour, if that be a Sign of
Avarice, even take it away; for a Covetous Husband is the
Devil</font> . <font>There is no necessity for any of these</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the
youngest Bride-maid;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>for there is Variety enough in
Colours; and therefore I am for Flame Colour,
Flesh Colour, Willow, and Milk White</font> . <font>You have mixt
good and bad together</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the Milliner:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>As for Flame
Colour, nothing can be better; for that denotes Beauty
and Desire; but you have spoiled all with Flesh Colour,
for that shews Lasciviousness; nor are you better in the 
Willow, for that signifies forsaken</font> . <font>How</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the eldest
Bride-maid,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Lasciviousness and Forsaken! Udsbobs,
we will have neither of them; For though I like
Wantonness well enough, I cannot abide Lasciviousness: And
then what a rude Thing would it be, to give such Favours
to young Ladies and Gentlemen, as should tell the VVorld
they were forsaken by their Lovers? And therefore my
Advice is to keep the Flame Colour and the VVhite, and
to put in the Sea Green and the Red</font> . <font>The Red</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
the Milliner,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>signifie Justice, and so may do very well;
but as for Sea Green, that is a Colour of Inconstancy</font> .
<font>Why then</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the youngest Bride-maid,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that will
do best in the VVomen's Top-knots, and be suitable to
their Dispositions; but I would have the Red stand by all
means; I will tell you why, Because if a young Man
<pagebreak id="51" />
marries a young Woman, and neglects doing of her
Justice, he ought to be banished from the Society of
the Female Sex. But what shall we have with it?
What do you think of Maiden's Blush, Carnation, and
Peach Colour</font> ? <font>As for Peach Colour, I like it well</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Milliner;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>but Maiden's Blush denotes
Envy, and Carnation shews Deceit; which might well
enough serve at a Widow's Wedding: But with
Submission, I think it not so proper at a young Virgin's</font> .
<font>Well, after all</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the elder Bride-maid,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>let us
keep the Maiden's Blush out of the Bride's Top-knot,
and the rest of us may wear it well enough: For I am
afraid, the Coyest of us all will be ready to Envy
her for being married before us</font> . <font>Well</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the
youngest Bride-maid,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I see there is so much
Diversity in Colours, that we shall never be all of a Mind,
and therefore let me make one Proposal for
accommodating this Matter, and that is thus: Let us refer it
to the Milliner himself</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>To this they all agreed;
and he being desired to make the Favours 
according to the best of his Judgment, did so.</nonSpeech> <omission type="line" />

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Well, in return of all these good Wishes, the

he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>VVhat think you of a VVhet before Dinner</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>And

was in a fair Way to have gone round the third

<pagebreak id="55" />
<comment type="compiler">THE NARRATOR THEN TELLS THE READER HOW LITTLE THE GUESTS
CONVERSED UNTIL THE THIRD COURSE OF DINNER.</comment>
<omission type="sentence" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>For a grave Gentleman, that had pretty
well satisfied the Cravings of his Stomach, and so
had nothing else to do, begins to entertain the
Company with an Harangue in praise of 
Marriage; and at first dash, tells them, <font>Marriage was
instituted in Paradise</font> ; in Deference to whose learned
<pagebreak id="56" />
Opinion, all the Religious Youngsters make a very
reverend bow to him. Upon which he proceeds
thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Marriage, let me tell ye, Gentlemen and
Ladies, is a very serious Thing: For besides that, as I
told you before, it was instituted in Paradise; it was
there also they were bid to Increase and Multiply</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>At
this Word starts up a great Matron, who now
thought it was a fit time for her to speak, and says,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>If they had not, I do not know where you and I should
have been, old Gentleman</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>which set all the Company a
sneering</font> : But the old Gentleman goes on:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>It is
Marriage that furnishes Churches with Pastors, Courts
with Judges and Magistrates, and Kingdoms with
Soldiers for their Defence: And therefore, Children are to
be esteem'd the blessings of Heaven, and so they were by
the Jewish Women, who accounted Barrenness, if not a
Curse, yet a very great Scandal</font> . <font>Ay, truly</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (says an
arch Wag of a Midwife, who had a mind to make
a Parenthesis in his Discourse) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>and so do the English
Women too I'll assure you: But I hope for better Things
from my young Mistress here: For I look upon my
Master to be a likely Man, and one that can do Business.
I'll tell you what Gentlefolks, I had Nine Children
in seven Years, my self; and so may my young
Mistress there too, for ought I know, for she is as likely as
I; and I hope</font> , Mr. <font>Bridegroom, you are as well
provided as my Husband was; I am sure your Nose
promises as well, and I do not doubt it: And let me
tell you, I have often given shrew'd Guesses in such 
Cases</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Midwife being at this time out of
Breath, the old Gentleman went on with his
Harangue:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mariage</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said he,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>is not only in Esteem
among Christians, but also among Pagans: For
among the</font> Lacedemonians, <font>all Men that were not
<pagebreak id="57" />
marrid before Twenty, were to be whipt by the 
Women as Drones: And among the</font> Romans, <font>Those that
had been three times Married, were crown'd with
Garlands of Palm-trees</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>He would have 
proceeded to the tyring of the Company, but very
luckily there was a Pear-pye set before him, which
made Water in his Mouth, and put an end to his
Discourse. The Midwife, that was resolv'd to
have no more of his tedious Lecture, pronounced
a Question to him, to turn the Tide of his
Discourse:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Pray Sir</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>let me ask you one
Question; What Age do you think most proper for a young
Couple to Marry at</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>But the Gentleman having his
Mouth full of Pear-pye, could make no Return:
And therefore the Midwife, resolving not to be 
bauk'd, went on, without any Answer, thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Why
then, young <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: yonng</comment> Gentlemen, and Ladies too, for I  
speak
to you all; I'll tell you why I ask, because I knew a
young Man that wanted something of Nine, who got
a Maid with Child</font> . <font>A young Man, do ye call him</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>says one of the Guest?</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I rather think it was a Boy,
at that Age</font> . <font>Why, look ye, Sir</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>reply'd she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you
may call him a Boy indeed, because he was so young,
but I am sure he play'd a Man's Part in getting a
Child</font> , <font>I am afraid, Mother</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says a merry Wag
at the Table,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>that the Maid had some other Help,
besides that young Man</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>Which set them all a
laughing: But Mrs. Bride only pull'd down her Hood
over her Eyes, and smil'd. The Midwife was not
so to be dash'd out of Countenance, and therefore
very readily reply'd,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well, Gentlemen, let them
laugh that win, but as I hope to be a Lady, the
Story was true, as that I drink off this Glass; and so,
here is a good Health to the Bride and Bridegroom,
and all the rest of the good Company, and send ye all
<pagebreak id="58" />
good Luck; Nay, and more than that</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (and then she
sets down her Glass) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I have heard of a Boy, if you'll
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: you ll</comment>
have it so, that at ten Years of Age got his Nurse with
Child: How say you now? How say you</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the
Wag I mentioned before?</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Why, I say he was a 
very tractable Lad, for his Nurse put him forward I'll
warrant ye?</font> <font>Truly</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I have good Authority
for what I say, if what a Scholar reported to me, be
true, do ye see now. And therefore I would advise all
Parents, not to let young Children of different Sexes lie
together; for I have heard the young Cock crow, as well
as the old One: Nay, do not think strange of what I
say: for I assure you all Physicians are of Opinion, that
Maids are ripe at Fourteen, and Men at Seventeen;
and some (as I have told ye) are qualified to do
Business sooner: But after Fourteen and Seventeen, both
Sexes hone after Matrimony, or something that's
Equivalent</font> . <font>That is</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says one of the Company,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>they
hone after Enjoyment</font> . <font>O my Conscience</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth
Mother Midnight,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>you are in the right of it; and 
therefore a Friend of mine said very well</font> , Marry your
Daughters betimes, or they will marry themselves,
<font>Now you may think, that I say this to promote my own
Trade; But ifecks I speak cordially for the publick
Good: But if I should, I hope there is no hurt in a good
Meaning: And so</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> (taking up the Glass) </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>once more,
here is the Bride and Bridegroom's good Health</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>After she
had drank, another of the Guests starts up, and says,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Well, I cannot but follow so good an Example, and
therefore Mrs. Bride, and Mr. Bridegroom, Here's your
good Health, I wish you much Joy, and every Year a
lusty Boy</font> . <font>That was well remembered</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the 
Midwife:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>That ought to have been my Wish indeed, but I
am so forgetful, I cannot think of my own Business</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>And
<pagebreak id="59" />
now the Bridegroom, that had the Pleasure to
hear all these Discourses, starting up of a sudden,
and taking a full Glass in his Hands, pay his
Devoirs to his fair Bride, and drinks to her, which
was accompanied with the loud Huzza's of the
whole Company, crying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Long live the Bride and 
Bridegroom; </dialogue><nonSpeech>And so the Dinner ended.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>As soon as they are risen from Table, and the
reciprocal Bows of all Parties to each other were
over, Mother Midnight comes up to the 
Bridegroom, and whispers him thus in the Ear:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now
Son, prove your self a Man; I'll warrant thee, Boy,
thou hast a Maiden-head: But have a care of being
too boisterous at first, you must crop the Flower 
gently, lest you pull up the whole plant by the Roots.
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Then leading him to the Bride:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Now the Blessing of
Heaven, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> light upon my young Mistress
here! Come, you'll have a happy Night on't I'll
warrant you: Never fear it, Madam; you'll undergo
it well enough: Marry, I wish I was to take your
place: The very Thoughts on't makes my Mouth
water. Well, Heavens bless your Endeavours, and
send you a whole Dicker of Boys and Girls, that you 
may live to be a great Grand-mother. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then
turning her about,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Ladies and Gentlewomen, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
You see here is a good Example, </dialogue><nonSpeech> (pointing to the
Bride and Bridegroom) </nonSpeech><dialogue> pray make haste and follow
it. Remember what the Song says, Gather your
Rose-buds while you may. A Word to the Wise is
enough. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then one of the Guest cries,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, Ladies,
now let us have a Dance. A good Motion, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries
another:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
   <font>The shaking of your Heels, now let us see;
   The shaking of the Sheets anon will be</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And was not the very Thoughts of that think you,
<pagebreak id="60" />
a great Pleasure to the Bridegroom? Then the
Company draw out, and each Man takes his Mate:
But just as they were going to dance, the merry
Midwife cries out, by way of Admiration:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>A 
goodly Sight by my Troth! Whip me if ever I saw Pidgeons
better pair'd: Well, if I could have my Will, they
should go just thus coupled to the Parson, and all
be married together: O it would be a comely Sight 
indeed! And then what Increasing and Multiplying
would there be! And what a deal of Business should
I have about three Quarters of a Year hence</font> ! <font>All in
good Time, Mother</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>says one of the Guests:</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My
Turn will come by and by, as the Men said that was
last to be hang'd</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then to dancing they went, and
O what Pastime was it for the bridegroom to see
and hear himself admir'd by all the Company, for
his Activity in Dancing, and cutting his Capers
like the High-lander, and keeping time with his
Head and Tail together, just like a Crow that is
pecking of Nuts: 'Tis true, the rest do but
whisper out his Praises, but the Midwife, she cries out
aloud;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Well danc'd, young True Penny! Thou art
right, I'll <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: I ll</comment> warrant thee: Thou wilt do a Woman's

it be to be had; for she expects some
peculiar Pleasure in the getting of it, which she has not
yet tasted. And therefore away rambles she to
confer with her Friends and Neighbours about the
Matter. And seeing at one House a lusty young
Boy in Nurse's Arms,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Goodlack</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>What
<pagebreak id="87" />
a fine lusty Child is this! How long have you been
Married, pray</font> ? Near fourteen Months, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the
other.</nonSpeech><dialogue> And pray how old is your Child then?
Why I think it will be about four Months old to
Morrow Sevennight. Udsbods, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says our young 
Woman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you have made use of your time: Why I
have been married this half Year, and nothing
coming yet. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Before she had made an end, 
another of the Gossips came in, and having heard
her last Words,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what is the Matter, 
Neighbour, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Matter! </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Child's Mother:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
In good Truth, I think there is Matter enough:
Why she has been Married half a Year, and no
Sign of any thing yet. How! </dialogue><nonSpeech>Says the other:</nonSpeech><dialogue>
That is Matter enough indeed; and yet for all that
there may be no Fault in the Man: 
Uds-niggars-noggers, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the young Woman,</nonSpeech><dialogue> the Man in no
Fault! Why does one of my Years and
Complexion look as if there were any Deficiency in me? I
know myself so well, that I will give any One leave
to judge whether I am in the Fault or no. Hold a
little, you are too hot, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the second Neighbour;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
All Women are not alike. Some Women have
been two or three Years married before they have
had a Child. Very well; and you would have me
stay so long too, would you? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Just as she was
going to be angry, in steps a grave experienced
Neighbour, with this short Prologue,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I have just
been at my Neighbour <font>Fruitful's</font> Groaning: How,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the other:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is she brought to Bed then? Yes,
of a very fine Boy. And how long had she been
married, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries the young Woman?</nonSpeech><dialogue> But the other
Day in a manner. Goodness! But the other Day!
And I have been this half Year married, and do not
find the Ground-work is yet laid! </dialogue><nonSpeech>By this Time
<pagebreak id="88" />
other Neighbours come in, and the matter being
canvass'd among them; One of the wisest makes
this Speech:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mistress, this is a Matter of no
small moment, let me advise you, therefore, to
take the just Dimensions of your Husband's
Instrument of Generation, both as to the Length and
Compass, for till then, no right Judgment can
be made. I think that is needless, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says another,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
for I know my Neighbour's Husband, and I'll
assure you he is a very likely Man: But he has not
been long married, and is very Uxorious, and
you know a Man may over do his VVife, as well 
as under do her: And therefore, Neighbour, if
you will have a Child, put a Curb to your Husband's
Fury, and give him a little time to supply what
has been exhausted: Yolks of Eggs, Cock-stones,
Lobsters, Cray-fish, Periwinkles, Oysters, Beef
Marrow, Sweet VVine, and Skirrits, are Things 
you would do well to give him; for they have a
great deal of Spermatick Virtue. I think, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says
one of the good VVomen,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you nam'd Skirrits, they
are the best Things in the VVorld, I can assure you:
For my Husband is a Seaman, and brought me
Home some Skirrits, and told me it was what the
Sweedish VVomen gave their Husbands to make
them kind, when they perceiv'd their Affections
were in the VVane: And so we eat the Skirrits
together; and I really found the good Effects of
them; for my Husband would needs have me up
into the Chamber after Dinner; and to tell you the
truth, he never pleas'd me better in his Life: So
that I thought I could not do a better thing than
persuade him to go into <font>Sweedland</font> again, and to
bring some more Skirrits with him. You have
interrupted me, Mistress, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she that spoke
<pagebreak id="89" />
before;</nonSpeech><dialogue> but I like what you said; tho' I am going to
tell ye, That the Kidneys of a little Crocodile 
dry'd, and beaten to Powder, and about half an
Ounce of it drank in a Glass of Alicant, will make
your Husband so kind, that you need not doubt 
of the good Effect of his Embraces. I suppose you
are not ignorant of the Virtue of Eringoes: It is
one of the choicest Things the Confectioners make,
unless it be a Satyrion Root; which if they knew
the use of, they would candy greater quantities
than they do. Ay, so they would, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cry'd another;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
and there be your Cantharides too. Have a care
there, Neighbour, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the former;</nonSpeech><dialogue> Cantharides
must not be made too bold with: They are
dangerous Things, and must be us'd with Judgment.
Give me leave to tell you a true Story, 
Neighbours: A young married VVoman that shall be
nameless at present, not being got with Child so
soon as she desir'd, repair'd to an Apothecary she
knew, and ask'd if there was no Drug in his Shop
would invigorate her Husband to get her with
Child? The Apothecary told her, he had a
Powder, which if given her Husband in a little Broth,
would make him as Lusty as <font>Hercules</font> . The
VVoman desir'd, and had the Dose, paying what he
ask'd for it. And giving it according to
Directions, found the Operation to her own Content.

<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech>So
finding a fit Opportunity, she one Day opens the
Matter to him thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Dear, we have made a
shift to get an Estate, but have neither Child nor
Chick to leave it to. The Fault of that does not lie
at my Door, says my Friend; I have done enough
to get one. That is the Thing in Question, said his 
Wife, and therefore I would fain have try'd it. Try'd,
quo' he, we have try'd it oft enough, I think
already; and I know no other Way to try it than
we have done. Why, I will tell ye Husband, quo'
she, I have a Crotchet in my Pate. Ay, ay, says
my Friend, I do not question but you have Crotchets
enow in your Pate, but that wont all make a
Child. Ay but, says she, the Way that I will
propound, is the Way to have a Child, either of yours
or mine. Say you so, says my Friend; prithee,
Dear, tell me what Way is that? But then you
must agree to it, says the Wife, I'll agree to any 
thing, quoth he, so that I may but have a Child of
my own: Why then Husband 'tis this, says she:
Do you chuse a young Maid for your
Companion, and I'll chuse out a young Man for mine: And
so let us make a fair Tryal: If you get the Maid
with Child, then the Fault is mine; but if the Man
gets me with Child, then the Fault is yours.
This is an extraordinary Contrivance, and much
to the Purpose, says the Husband, and I very 
readily agree to it: And because I'll make as little
Noise on it as can be, says he, I'll even take our
Maid, for she is a good cleanly little Girl, and
one that looks as if she could do Business. I like
your Choice very well, said the Wife; and
<pagebreak id="94" />
because I'd make as little Noise as you; I'll e'en make
Choice of our Journey-man, and then the Thing
will be all done among ourselves. And all Parties
being agreed, by his Tryal of Skill it was soon
known where the Fault lay; the poor
Journey-man labour'd in vain; all his Seed was lost upon
that barren Soil on which he cast it. But it far'd 
otherwise with the Husband, for he so well 
cultivated the Ground that he broke up, that the
Unmarried Maid was in three Quarters of a Year
Metamorphos'd to a Mother, and brought her
Master a brave Boy to Town, which brought I
know not how much Joy to the whole Family.
'Tis true, the Neighbours were disgruntled, and
the Church-warden would have been secur'd that
the Bantling should be no Charge to the Parish:
But the good Wife readily answer'd, There was
no need of that, for she would bring up the Child for
her own. And was there not a great deal of
Pleasure now in all this Contrivance? The good
Wife had the Pleasure of her Man, and the 
Husband of his Maid: The Child was of the Master's
own getting, and the Maid gave it freely to her
Mistress; the Mistress accepted the Gift, and the
Maid was ready for another Tryal, if her Mistress
was not satisfied with that.

<omission type="line" /> <nonSpeech>Now Women have always an
Ambition to equal one another:</nonSpeech><dialogue> And therefore, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the
Wife's Mother to her Son-in-law,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I should be sorry that
any Daughter of mine should lye in like a Porter's Wife:
You had a good Portion with my Daughter: I am sure
much more than Mr. <font>Little Corn</font> had with his Wife; and
yet, I will assure you she lay-in the other Day, and had all
Things very decent about her. And I can tell you it
will be much for your Credit, if you take care that my
Daughter be rather above her than below her, for great
notice will be taken of it. And now is the time to shew
yourself like a Father, as you have done already like a
Husband. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And is it not a Pleasure for a Man to be
convinc'd by such Arguments as these? For look you, do you
see, when a Wife's Mother speaks to the Husband about
the Daughter, it is all Gravity, and the Arguments are
unanswerable. And indeed, what can the Son say to
his? The best Answer is,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Mother, You know I know
<pagebreak id="103" />
nothing of these Matters, and therefore must refer them
to your better Judgment, and more prudent 
Management. But, Mother, pray be as frugal as you can. 
Frugal! </dialogue><nonSpeech>Replies the Mother in a great Pet;</nonSpeech><dialogue> pray when
did you ever know me otherwise? Nay, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the Son,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I do not speak of that Mother -- but -- But me no Buts,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth the Mother;</nonSpeech><dialogue> for I thought you had a better Opinion
of me: I am sure you have reason to have it, for I have
sav'd you above 40 <font>l.</font> by these two Suits of Child
bed-Linnen I have already presented your Wife with; two
such Suits as the best Alderman's Wife in the Parish need
not be asham'd of. I take it a miss you should But me
with these Buts; for I think I have done a Mother's
Part. </dialogue><nonSpeech>This sharp Repartee of the Mother, makes the
Son pull in his Horns, with a,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mother, do what you
think fit: </dialogue><nonSpeech>For the young Man finds he may as well But
against the City Walls; as But against the Wife's Mother;
for it is a sure Rule, the Mother and the daughter are
always of a side. But those are but easie Things, all this 
is still a Pleasure; and so cannot be call'd a discomfort of
Matrimony. The young Man is willing to comply, tho'
he is willing to save his Money, and so there is another
way to fetch him finely over the Coals. Suppose we him
therefore in Bed with his big-bellied Wife; and after some
private Favours granted, thus he begins to come over
him:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Lack-a-day, my dear, could I but have guess'd
what Charges Matrimony brings along with it, I believe
I should never have Marryed. Why, what Charges now,
my dear? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cries the kind Husband,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Alack, alack, my
Mother tells me of so many Things I shall want, that it
even distracts me. Prithee, what Things are those, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries
he?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why she tells me I must have a new Bed. Well, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>says the good natur'd Fool,</nonSpeech><dialogue> do not let that trouble thee.
I know of a lovely damask Bed to be sold at Second
Hand; and I fancy I can have it very reasonable: I am
sure for less than half what it cost. How, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says the Wife,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
a Second hand Bed: Foh upon it: After I know not who
has lain in it, and with I know not what distempers: I'll
be poyson'd with no Second-hand Bed. Well, well,
<pagebreak id="104" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech>cries the Husband,</nonSpeech><dialogue> then thee shalt have a new One. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And
is not this a Pleasure now for a Man to find that nothing
will please his Wife but the best? Here is nothing like
any Disturbance, but all as calm and smooth as Cream in a
Milk-bowl.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>But in the Morning the Mother comes again:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well,
Son, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> you advis'd me Yesterday to be as frugal
as I could; and I have been studying all this Night long to
save Charges; but after all, I find you must be at the
Expence of a new Bed. 'Tis the first time, and it will
be for your Reputation to have all Things New. But
whether it had best be a Damask, or a find Cloath Bed,
that is what I know not how to resolve on. But which
soever it be, for the first Fortnight it must be all
Callicut both within and without; and therefore that must
be had in the first Place. How much do you think will
serve, Mother, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries the Son?</nonSpeech><dialogue> About as much as will
reach the length of a Mile; for you must consider, there
must be Chairs, and Stools, and Cushion correspondent,
and that is a Thing that you must have regard to. For I
will tell you, A Parson came once to pray with a poor 
Woman that was just recommending her Soul to Heaven,
and because the poor Woman had never a Cushion for
him to kneel upon, he even left her to make what shift
she could for herself; for without she'd had a Cushion
he would pray none with her. And do you think that our
Parson that has above 300 <font>l.</font> a Year, and rustles in the
best Silks he can buy, will christen your Child without
an extraordinary Cushion. And then there must be
(for you know these are Things that cannot be avoided)
a Crimson Sattin Mantle, with a Gold and Silver Lace as
broad as -- I wont tell you how broad, but your Wife
may -- For that is the Rule we go by: So that when the
Gossips see the Breadth of the Lace upon the Mantle,
they readily guess at something else. So that it will
advance your Reputation to have a broad Lace on your
Child's Mantle: I shall not need to explain myself
further, for Word to the Wise is enough. But, 
good-lack-a-day what have I forgot? You must have a
<pagebreak id="105" />
Cupboard of Plate, whatever comes on it: And if the
Warming Pan were of the same Mettal, it would be much more
genteel; and rather than you should be without it, I would
give 40 <font>s.</font> towards it myself. There ought also for the
Day in which the Child is made a Christian, to be a large
pair of fine <font>Holland</font> Sheets, with deep <font>Flanders</font> Lace, or if
it were fine <font>Honiton-Lace</font> , I believe that may do very
well; for I would not have you be extravagant neither,
nor would I put you to any more Charge than needs
must ---- And tho' these Charges may seem great, yet you
must consider it is but for once in your whole Life: For
as soon as the Month is out, they are laid up in Lavender
till the next Occasion, unless (as Fashions alter) you
think fit to make any Change. <comment type="compiler">NO ITALICS FOR Lace IN

there must be a new Gown at the first going of your
Wife abroad: For every time she is a new Woman, and it is
but Reason that a new Woman should have new Cloaths.
I think also it is best to put you in mind (tho' that it is
what you cannot be Ignorant of) that there must be care
taken for Belly-Cheer, whatever be wanting; and
therefore you must provide fine Sugar, not only for your
Wife's <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Wfe's</comment> use, but for the Nurse to steal: (for

to come in for her Snack, in all such Cases. And for
your general Entertainments, they ought to bear some

   <nonSpeech>One Woman wants to be satisfied about the best time
for a Man's Caressing of his Wife, whether it be day or
night, and what part of it either? Now where can this
Question be put for a Satisfactory Answer, so properly
as amongst those that have made Trial of all Times, and
so are best qualified for determining the Case. And
therefore the Question being fairly started, that there are,
or ought to be, certain Set times allow'd for that 
matter; which were the most proper Seasons? To this, one
gave her Judgment for four or five Hours after
dinner; and another four or five Hours after Supper: For
then the Body was neither too full, nor too empty,
<pagebreak id="116" />
either of which are Hindrances to the due 
Performance; and that in that time the Concoxion of the
Stomach is in a great measure perfected, the natural Heat
is refreshed, and the Spirits are invigorated. And tho'
the Man should be liberal in his Expences, yet there
would be still a Reserve in Store. Another was of
Opinion, That Evening-Caresses were most delightsome,
but those of the Morning more wholsome: Upon which
a third declared that it was so, she was for the 
Evening-Caresses for Pleasure, and the Morning Embraces for
Health: And this last Opinion was generally embraced
by the whole Company. But the Scruples of the first
were not yet answered, which was to know what were
the certain Limits which Nature had set to the
Frequency of Performance. But here one of the Gossips said,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Neighbour, I do not like this Talk of Limits, as if a Man
were to be stinted in his Duty: For my Part, I never
stint my Husband in this Case; let him e'en do it as
often as he pleases, he shall never be stinted for me: I'll
never do, as I have read a Woman did in <font>Portugal</font> , who
complained to the King of her Husband's being too kind
to her, and desir'd the King to stint him, as to the
Frequency of his Love. How, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> that Woman
was a Fool, and so was the Man too, to be stinted by
him. I think so truly, </dialogue><nonSpeech>replied another:</nonSpeech><dialogue> I am sure he
should never have stinted my Husband, had he been the
best King in <font>Christendom</font> : 'Tis an Infringement of the
Liberty of the Subject: Stinted! Udsbodkins, I would
fain know what Authority any King has to stint my
Husband ----- </dialogue><nonSpeech>At this, finding the Woman to grow into
a Passion, they all fell a-laughing; and after the Cup
was pass'd about, they call'd a new Cause, and that was
about the Duty of Husbands:</nonSpeech><dialogue> For my Part, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says one,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I think it is but our Husbands Duty to be Subservient to
our Wills, and it is our own Faults if they are not; for
seeing it is we that bear, it is but fit that they should 
suffer: We treat them at first as our Equals, and then their
Ambition soon promps them to become our Masters; but
let us keep them under at first, and they will be always so. I
<pagebreak id="117" />
had one Occasion to go to a Gossipping, as this is, and
I ordered my Husband to come and fetch me Home at
such an Hour, but he never came; but he had better
have come: For I made him Court me a whole Week
afterwards, before I'd let him come to Bed to me. Nay,
if my Mind has not been well, I have made him rise many
a Time in a frosty Morning, to kindle me a Fire in my
Chamber. But suppose, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said another Gossip,</nonSpeech><dialogue> he had
been refractory, and would not have done this? Why
then, </dialogue><nonSpeech>quoth she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I would have kick'd out of Bed; he should
not have laid foisting by me, while I wanted to have
any thing done. You are happy, Madam, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries the other;</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I wish I could follow your Example: But, alas, my
Husband comes in roaring and ranting a Nights, as if he had
pull the House down; and if I do but speak the least
Word to contradict him, then he falls foul upon the
great Looking-glass in the Dining-room; and then I fall
a crying, and am forced to hold my Peace for fear he
should break something else. If he were my Husband,

them all Home again, if I do, and what shall I be the
better for that? O a great deal, says the other, for before 
he can send them Home again, break them yourself, and
that will make him weary of breaking Looking-glasses, I
warrant you. My Neighbour has hit it, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries another;</nonSpeech><dialogue>

think it?) there I found the prettiest little moppet of a
Babe that I ever saw in my Life, fast asleep, and as quiet
as a Lamb; I presently called up my Maid, and 
demanded of her whose Child that was? She presently fell
upon her knees, and asked my Pardon; telling me it was
hers: Yours, Impudence, said I; Pray who got it?
My Master, forsooth, quoth she; I could not find in my
heart to do it any hurt: and have looked to it so 
carefully ever since it was born, that I am sure you never so
much as heard it cry; no more I did not truly. And I
was so taken with the Inginuity and good Nature of my
maid towards the innocent moppet, that I even sent for
a Nurse, and put it out at my own Charges. But where
was the Revenge of all this, </dialogue><nonSpeech>was the general cry of all?</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
O, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> as that was my Husband's Child, and none

mine, and none of my Husband's. Besides, I read the
poor Cuckold such a curtain Lecture for it, that I have

masters to kiss their Maids, as it is for Children to piss

tho' the Mistress lay a dying. Ay, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says another Gossip,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I
can tell you a pleasant Story <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Sory</comment> about that. Pray 
what is it,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>cried they all?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Why then thus it was: There was a
certain Pewterer that had a very good careful Wife, whom
he loved very well; but, alas, the good Woman fell very
sick on a sudden; and her Husband, knowing she was
not immortal, though verily she had been upon her 
death-bed; which made him sigh, and sob, and bemoan
his Loss at such a pitiful Rate as would have grieved any
one to see it: Insomuch that nothing would serve his
Turn, but he would even die with her: At last, when
every one thought the poor Woman past Recovery, and
no Body was in the Chamber but himself and the 
Chamber-maid, who was of a Rosy Complexion, and
Beautiful enough, he called the poor harmless Girl to him
<pagebreak id="119" />
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT GIVES PAGE NUMBER 119 AS NUMBER 199</comment>
(for she was hardly twenty Years of Age) and he spoke her
thus, as well as Grief would give him leave: O <font>Betty</font> ,
I see thy Mistress draws near her End, and I am even
resolv'd to die with her; and therefore, here take the
Keys, for I recommend my House and Children, and
what I have to thy Care. The poor Thing was so touch'd
with her Master's Compassion to her Mistress, that she
gave him the most comfortable Words she could, 
desiring him to <font>lay aside all such despairing Thoughts, for he
might still live to take care of his Children himself</font> ; and
that he had the more need, if her Mistress did die, to
take care of himself upon that Account. O <font>Betty</font> , cry'd
he, there is but one Thing can recover me, and that is
the hopes that thou wilt be kind to me; and thereupon
flings her upon the Bed, and falls a Kissing her, and
feeling her Bubbies, and would have proceeded farther, if
the Maid had not struggled with him: All which being
beheld by the Sick Wife, who had not spoken in three
days before, it put her into such a Rage, that she
recovered her Speech again first, and then her Health, and
lived many Years after, to upbraid the Hypocrisie and
Falseness of her Husband.
   It was very well done of her indeed, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cry'd they all?</nonSpeech><dialogue> 
For the Man was a little too Hasty: But now you talk
of Maids, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says one of the Company,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tell you a good
Story of a Man that served me, and lived with me three
or four Years after I was Married: She was a good
handsome Girl, as well as an honest Girl: And my Husband,
you must know, had such a Mind to be doing with her,
that when I was out of the way, he'd never let her be in
quiet, which the Maid always gave me an Account of.
But at length, the Wench being quite tired with his
Solicitations, was resolved to put a Trick upon him, and
be rid of him for ever; and thus it was: I being at a
Neighbour's hard by, which my Husband knew nothing
of, but thinking I had been further off, and safe enough,
he goes to the Wench, who was sifting of Flower in the 
Pastry to make a Lamb-Pasty of, and had a Straw Hat on
her Head, and a Night Rail about her Shoulders, and
<pagebreak id="120" />
coming to her, was very hot in his Courtship, urging the 
Convenience of such an Opportunity, which was not to
be slipt: The Maid seems to comply; but being willing 
to be secure, desires him to keep the Boulter going
while she went out upon the Scout, to see all Things were 
safe; and so gave him the Straw Hat and Night Rail to put
on till she came again; my Husband readily consented;
but now what does this Wench do, but comes running to
tell me what Business she left him employ'd in: Away
comes I, as fast as I could, to give my new Pastry-Maid a
Visit: But never did I see poor Creature so strangely 
bedizen'd, as he was with the Flower, the Night-Rail, and the
Straw Hat: Honest Wench, said I to him, what shall I
give you a Year to live with me, for I believe you may
make a very good Servant? But when my Husband heard
my Voice, he then found himself betray'd; which made
him look as if he could not help it; but he never stay'd to
make a reply; but flinging off the Straw Hat, and taking
off the Night-Rail, away runs he out at the Back-door, as
if Nick had been at his Tail. Marry, and so I think he
was, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> when you were so near him; </dialogue><nonSpeech>at which
they all broke out into a loud Laughter.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Well, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says
another Gossip,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will tell you a Story of a young Gamester
that was kind to his Maid; and one Morning very early,
for want of a better Opportunity, he carried her into the
Grass-plat in the Garden, and laying her down gently, did
what he should not a done with her, but perceiving one
of his Neighbours had seen him, soon after has done his
Wife into the same Place, and there serves her as he had
serv'd the Maid: Within a Day or two after, came the
good Woman that had seen him at it with his Maid, and
tells her what she had seen her Husband do to his Maid.
My Maid! Neighbour, says the good Woman, you are
mistaken, it was myself. Why, said the Neighbour, (who
was sure of what she saw) do you think I do not know you
from your Maid? I tell you it was your Maid: And I am
sure, reply'd the other, I know the Matter better than you
do, and I tell you it was myself: Nor could her Neighbour
after all persuade her to the contrary.
<pagebreak id="121" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And now they proceed to other Causes, and if they
know any Ill of their Neighbours, besure now they will
declare it. Nay, I say that of them, they are
impartial too, for if they should chance to hear any Good they
do (for every Age produces some Miracles) they will speak
of that too:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Neighbour, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says one of them to another,</nonSpeech><dialogue> I
heard such a One was forced to submit to a Search
the other Day in the Court of Arches, upon her Husband's
Complaint. Uds-niggers-noggers, but did she? Pray
what was the Issue? O, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the other,</nonSpeech><dialogue> she came off
with flying Colours. As how, I pray? Why the
Midwife that gave in the Verdict, brought it in, That she
was in as good a Condition <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Conditition</comment> as she was,  
and had
sufficient to serve any four Men in <font>England</font> . Why then
Neighbour, sure her Husband might be satisfied. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then
another whispers her Neighbour in the Ear, (but so loud
that she might be heard by all the Company) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gossip,
did you hear nothing of Mrs. <font>Lightbody</font> ? No, not I, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said
the other?</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray what of her? Why they say she was
brought Home in a Coach the other Night, at past twelve
a Clock, by three extraordinary <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: extraordiary</comment>        
Gallants, and six great
Candles were called for, to light them up Stairs: And
there they were entertained with Wine, and I know not
what, till three a Clock in the Morning: And 
sometimes Mrs. <font>Lightbody</font> and one of the Sparks with her,
went into a with-drawing Room, and afterwards
another, and then the third, and tarried with each of them
half an Hour at a time all alone. Why, you do not say so, 
</dialogue><nonSpeech>says her Gossip.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, but I do, </dialogue><nonSpeech>says she,</nonSpeech><dialogue> and could make
it out too; but I will not say all I know; for the Thing
was told to me as a Secret, and I do not care to be a Blab
of my Tongue. Why, methinks One might have served
her Turn, </dialogue><nonSpeech>said the other.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I think so too, Neighbour: It
is as much as an honest Woman can dispence withal, at
least if her Husband's be like mine. You say well for
tha`t, says the other; but some Women are never 
satisfied. I pity the poor Man her Husband; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and then shakes
her Head, as tho' she would shake the Teeth out of her 
Mouth:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Neighbour, these are ill Things.
<pagebreak id="122" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And thus sometimes Drinking, and sometime Chatting,
they spent their Time, till their Husbands were come to
attend them Home. And now the young Father (who was
loth to disturb them before, that they might Chat the more
freely together) enters the Room, attended by all their
Husbands; who are resolved to have their Turn of 
Talking as well as the Women:</nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, my Dear, </dialogue><nonSpeech>cries one of
them,</nonSpeech><dialogue> take notice of this Youngster: I intend to get you
such another before to Morrow Morning. Stay and hold,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>says his Wife:</nonSpeech><dialogue> But I will not tye you up to such hard
Meat; I will give you a Week's Time, and do the Best you
can; and yet I am afraid you will come short of my
Neighbour. </dialogue><nonSpeech>And is not this a Pleasure for the young Father, to
hear his Workmanship commanded thus?</nonSpeech>

<omission type="line" /> <nonSpeech>There are
some Men indeed in the World that do not care to have
their Children (almost as soon as born) in gaudy Silk,
<pagebreak id="125" />
Lac'd Coats, and all other Matters correspondent; but
their Wives have an Answer ready cut and dry'd for them,
which is,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Is it finer than my Neighbour <font>Allfine's</font> Child?
Nor so fine neither, I am sure: And I am sure we may
afford it as well as she: </dialogue><nonSpeech>And this Answer stops the 
Husband's Mouth presently. And yet he is not so well
satisfy'd, but that he shakes his Head, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> My Dear, the
<font>Lacedemonians</font> were a frugal Nation, and never used to
dress up their little Ones in so gay a Manner. </dialogue><nonSpeech>This makes
the Wife angry, and therefore she returns,</nonSpeech><dialogue> Fart for the
<font>Lacedemonians</font> , and their Frugality too; What do you tell
me of the <font>Lacedemonians </font> ? Sure I know how to dress my
Children as well as the <font>Lacedemonians</font> ; and I tell ye, I
had as live have no Children, as not to see them go fine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>This may perhaps look a little rough; but by-and by
comes the God-mother, who having heard the Child is
to be Coated, brings in a gilt Coral, a Silver Spoon and
Poringer, and a new Tankard of the same Metal, with
a Train of half a score Gossips, and by-and-by such
another parcel, and as many more after them, till at last the
House be as full as the late Gossip's Feast. Why, here is
a new Trouble all of a sudden: And yet it cannot be
avoided neither; for the Odd-Mother will expect to be
treated, and handsomely too, for she deserves it; marry,
she should be treated every Day in the Week upon the 
same Terms. And as for the Provision, they that live
at <font>London</font> never want a Market. Then the Husband
beckons to his Wife.</nonSpeech><dialogue> -- Hark ye, do you hear? Why here is the
whole Tribe of <font>Gad</font> come in upon us: What, more Treats
yet? Yet, ah yes, and yet too, if I please: And what
of all that: they are your Friends as well as mine, be not
they? Come, prithee, do not stand, shall I, shall I; but
make hast to Market, and buy that which is good,
and send it Home quickly, for it is near Twelve a Clock,
and then, what Time will Dinner be ready?
