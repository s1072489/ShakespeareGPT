   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Mr. <font>Colledge</font> , will you call     
your Witness, for I
must tell the Jury as I did at your request, concerning Mr.          
<font>Attorney</font> , that
as nothing he said, so nothing you say is to be believed upon your   
own
Allegation; for then no man would ever be guilty, if his own Purgation
by words were to be believed.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I thank God, I know my own           
Innocency, and
hope to prove it. I have a Soul that must live to Eternity, either   
in Joy
or Misery, I act according to those principles, and I hope I have    
some
assurance of my own salvation when I dye, I would not call God to
Witness to a Lye, to save 1000 lives. My Lord, this is a villanous   
Conspiracy
against me, and if it take place against me, it may go a great way,  
God
knows how far, This is the <font>17th</font> or <font>18th</font> Sham Plot the        
Papists have
made against the Protestants, to get over their own; but I hope my   
Lord
God Almighty will never suffer it. If they can make me a Traytor,
they will try it upon others, and so hope to sham off their own      
Treasons;
but I say, I hope God Almighty will never suffer it. My Lord, I think
the first Witness that swore against me was Mr. <font>Dugdale</font> ; and I  
must call
my Witnesses as I have them here, I know no person of them hardly,   
and
this that is done for my defence was done abroad. My Lord, I have
been kept close Prisoner in the <font>Tower</font> , and none of them         
suffered to come
to me, whilst the Popish Lords have had the Liberty and Priviledg to
talk with their friends. Here are Witnesses I hope will prove that   
these
are Suborned men, for <font>Macnamarra</font> did tell me presently after the
Parliament broke up at <font>Oxon</font> , and whispered it to me in the      
Coffee-house, 
Said he, there is a Design laid to make us retract our Evidence, and 
go
over to <font>Fitz Girald</font> . Said I, I suppose they have been at that   
sport a great
while. Ah, said he, they make large offers. Said I, by whom? Said he,
Colonel <font>Warcupp</font> hath been at me, and he tells me --

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Macnamarra</font> is not produced against 
you as a
Witness at all.
<pagebreak id="39" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, but he told me this, that there was such  
a design, and, said he, I will
get you, and some other honest men, and he desired me to be by when  
he had
something more to tell which would do his business for him, but the  
next news I
heard of him was, he was put into <font>Newgate</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call your Witnesses, Mr. <font>Colledge</font> ,    
and prove what you can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mr. <font>Hickman</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire he may observe the    
same rule he desired
about our Witnesses; that he may call but one at a time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes, I will call them one by one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are not your Witnesses together? send to   
them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I don't know, I have not seen one since  
I come. This is not
the first time, my Lord, the Papists have designed to take away my   
Life, though it
is the first time they went about to take it away by a Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know not of one Papist that is a Witness 
against you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is never a man of them, except Sir          
<font>William Jennings</font> , but what was
a Papist.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What say you to Mr. <font>Masters</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Masters</font> says nothing material, it was     
only a jocose discourse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was very pleasant discourse upon my   
word; you were as
merry as when you were singing of the <font>Rary Shew</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you make mirth of the blackest  
Tragedy that ever
was. That horrid Rebellion, and the Murther of the late King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never justified that Parliament in any such     
thing that they did contrary to
Law.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He swears it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hickman</font> does not appear, call       
another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>William Shewin</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (who appeared.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you here Friend, you are not to be    
sworn; but when you
speak in a Court of Justice, and in a course of Justice, you must    
speak as in the
presence of God, and only speak what is true.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would not have any body speak any thing for me, 
but what is truth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now ask him what you will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know the Gentleman. But pray, Sir, will   
you tell what you know
of these Witnesses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name any of them that I know, pray Sir, and  
I'll tell you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know <font>Bryan Haynes</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know there is such a man, but I have       
nothing to say to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know <font>Turbervile</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray tell what you know of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I was in <font>Turbervile's</font> Company   
on Thursday night last at
the Golden Posts at <font>Charing-cross</font> , and there I heard him say,   
that if I were at
<font>Oxford</font> I should hear strange things against <font>Colledge</font> , and   
he would lay ten to one that
Mr. <font>Bethel</font> and Mr. <font>Wilmore</font> should be hanged at               
<font>Christmas</font> , and he would lead him
by the Gold Chain along <font>Fleetstreet</font> , and down with his Breeches 
in the middle of
the Coffee-house, with a Band about his Neck and a Cloak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say all these things against Mr.  
<font>Sheriff Bethel</font> , I assure you
he is a bold man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of Mr. <font>Smith</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know him by sight, but I have nothing in   
particular to say
concerning him. I have something to say to <font>Macnamarra</font> , Sir, if  
he were here.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of this Conspiracy in       
general?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What of your Conspiracy?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know that they did lay, who should be      
hang'd at <font>Candlemas</font> , who
at <font>Christmass</font> , and who at several other times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did you hear <font>Turbervile</font> say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those words I spake before about Sheriff     
<font>Bethel</font> , and about the
<font>Amsterdam</font> Coffee-house.
<pagebreak id="40" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they say what time I should be hang'd? for    
the discourse 'rose about
me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One told me that there was one that did      
design to be returned
upon this Jury, that was resolved to hang him right or wrong.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>High Sher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I did hear there was such a one, 
and I left him out
of the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For Mr. Sheriffs honour we must take       
notice of what he hath said.
He say, he heard of a man that spoke something of that nature, and   
therefore he
left him out of the Jury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now 'tis possible these Witnesses were at the     
same sport.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Shewin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was Mr. <font>Peacock</font> Mrs. <font>Fits-harris</font>     
Maids Father, or she here, either
of them Witnesses against you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, they were not, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did swear against me at the finding of the   
Bill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have only called these Witnesses, if  
you can say any thing
against them do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>Henry Hickman</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech> (who appeared.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Holl.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where do you live, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hickman.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Holborn-bridge</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Trade are you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Cabinet-maker.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you ask him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know <font>Haynes</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, very well; because he used to come to my    
house to a Popish
Widow that was a Lodger in my house where I live now; and this       
person was a
Prisoner at <font>Haynes's</font> when he was a Prisoner in the <font>Fleet</font> . I 
always had a suspicion
he was a Priest, not that I could accuse him really of any thing,    
but he several
times using to come to my house I thought so of him, and discoursing 
with my
Land-lady.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Tenant you mean?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Tenant. I asked her, what this fellow 
was; said she, he
is a very dangerous Fellow though he is a Papist, and I am one my    
self, yet he is
a dangerous person, and he does not much care what he swears against 
any one.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thus your Tenant told you, what do you  
know your self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Another time he came to speak with my Tenant  
Mrs. <font>Scot</font> , who is
now gone into <font>Ireland</font> ; when he came to the house, he asked me,  
is Mrs. <font>Scot</font>
within? Yes, said I, Mr. <font>Haynes</font> , she is above; and up he goes,  
and there they
locked the door, and plucked out the key; so I slipt off my Shoes,   
for I thought
there might be more danger from such people than I could discover    
any other
way. So I went up stairs, and stood at the door, and hearkned,       
hearing my
Land-lady talk something to him, he wraps out a great Oath, <font>God    
dam me</font> , said
he, <font>I care not what I swear, nor who I swear against; for 'tis my  
Trade to get money by
swearing</font> . Whereupon, my Lord, I came down as fast as I could, and 
a little
after I saw him go out, and as soon as my Land-lady came down, said  
I, Mrs. <font>Scot</font>
I desire you would provide your self as soon as you can; I would be  
civil to you,
and I would not put you to a Non-plus, because your Goods by the Law 
will be
seized for not departing according to the King's Proclamation. So a  
while ago 
since this business of <font>Haynes's</font> swearing against my Lord of      
<font>Shaftsbury</font> , I bethought
my self of some other businesses I had heard: To find out the        
Knavery I went to
the <font>Fleet</font> , where he hath a very ill Character as well amongst   
the Papists as the
Protestants. Whereupon I asked one fellow that was a kind of a       
Porter, if he
knew any thing of him; said he, Go you to such an one --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We must not permit this for Example      
sake, to tell what others
said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing is Evidence, but what you know of  
your own knowledge;
you must not tell what others said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This I do say, I heard him say; and there are    
those that can produce a
Letter --
<pagebreak id="41" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bring those people, but you must speak   
nothing, but upon your
own knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was at the Chamber door, and looked in at the  
Key-hole, and he sat
down at the Window.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How long ago was it, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Year and a half.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are an Eves-dropper, I perceive.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hickm.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not know what danger he might bring Men    
into, because he was
a Papist. I have taken an Oath to be true to the King, and I will as 
long as I live.
For this Gentleman, I never beheld him, till last night, in all my   
days; though
he lived by me, I never saw him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, call the next.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw this Gentleman; but you see what      
<font>Haynes</font> hath declared.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This Man says, he did say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And, for ought I perceive, he does accordingly.   
Call <font>Elizabeth Oliver</font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> (who appeared.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Oliver</font> , stand up. What do you    
ask her?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know <font>Haynes</font> , pray? <font>Bryan Haynes</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray tell the Court what you know of him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know him very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He writ a Letter in my Father's name,       
unknown to my Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you see him write it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him write it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Read it. By whom is it subscribed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Clerk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By no body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, how is it written in your Father's    
name, when it is not
subscribed at all?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> he writ it as from my Father.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whither did he bring it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He sent it into the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Can you write and read, Mistress?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who did he send it by?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Carrier.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When is it dated?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Clerk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In 77.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Read the Letter. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (Which was done.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Clerk.</font> Reads.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is all this to the purpose? unless    
your Father were here to
prove it was done without his knowledge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Father did not write it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was your Father in the Fleet then?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Lord, he was a Prisoner then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mrs. <font>Oliver</font> , do you know any thing more of   
him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have known him a great while; I know him  
to be a very ill Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Must she tell you all she knows?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you ever know him forswear himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Oliver.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I do not know that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, call another; this is nothing to the 
purpose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call Mrs. <font>Hall</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech> (who appeared.) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray,  
do you know Mr. <font>Bryan Haynes</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, if I see him I know him very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He lodged at my House, and came there the day 
before <font>Fitz-harris</font>
was tryed, and there was a great discourse about his Tryal, and I    
was enquiring
of him, and I told him, I must expose my Ignorance, I did not know   
what it was
he was tried for: And, said he, if you please to sit down, I will    
tell you: Madam
<pagebreak id="42" />
<font>Portsmouth</font> came to him, and went upon her knees, and begg'd of   
him, if he had
any kindness for His Majesty, that he would now shew it at this      
juncture, and she
told him she had heard he had formerly Acquaintance with one Mr.     
<font>Everard</font> abroad,
and therefore desired him to go now and renew it, and endeavour to   
get him over;
and, if he could possibly, to get over some others to make a         
Presbyterian Plot of
it. This is true, I very well know it: as for this Gentleman, I      
never saw his face
before, but those were the words I am sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What were the words?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That they might make a Presbyterian Plot of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he say so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said that the Dutchess of <font>Portsmouth</font>   
did so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What a story is this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not he say that the Dutchess of               
<font>Portsmouth</font> employed him too?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, this was about <font>Fitz-harris</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know more about <font>Haynes</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One night he had been about some business for 
me in Law with one
Mr. <font>Woodward</font> an Attorney at Law, and when he returned I was      
busie in the Kitchin
with my Maid about the House, and he came up to me; Madam, said he,  
this
night I had a Message from the King; a Justice of Peace met me, and  
brought me
word, that the King had sent into <font>Ireland</font> , to enquire into the  
Loyalty of my
Family, and he hath heard that my Father was a Loyal Subject, but he 
understood
strange things of me; but if I would come in, he would grant me my   
Pardon. I
told him, said he, I did not value His Majesty's Pardon a Pin, for I 
had done
nothing that might make me stand in need of it; but I would do any   
thing that might
tend to the preservation of His Majesty's Person or Honour, but to   
do such base
things as are beneath a Man, I will never do it; and he whisper'd me 
in the ear
(as the accusing of several Persons;) and since, he sent me a Letter 
by his Mother
in Law, Mrs. <font>Wingfield</font> , that I should not believe it, if I      
heard he should accuse
any body, but I might be confident he had not, nor would accuse any  
body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was he to swear against the Protestants?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did not enquire any Questions; but he said, 
such base things he
would never do as the accusing of several Persons.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray Mistress, did you believe him when 
he told you he was so
honest a Man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you mean, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When he said he would not do those base 
things, did you
believe him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw his face before he came there to  
lodge; but I saw him to
be a Man that made little Conscience what he said or swore.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did not you find him a bragging Man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I had little discourse, but what he said of   
himself. But there is one
thing more about an Intelligence: When <font>Thompson</font> had written      
something in his
Intelligence concerning <font>Bryan Haynes</font> , he said he would write an 
Answer to it; and
accordingly, he read it to us: he said, he was going that Evening to 
get it put
into one of the Intelligences: the words were to this purpose.       
&quot;Whereas one
<font>Nathaniel Thompson</font> had falsely and maliciously accused one       
<font>Bryan Haynes</font> for speaking
Treasonable Words; he the said <font>Bryan Haynes</font> doth declare that he 
challenges any
Man to charge him with it: but he owned he had an hand, or was       
employed to
put the Plot upon the dissenting Protestants.&quot; <comment type="compiler">NO END QUOTATION

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he publish that in the Intelligence?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Hall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never read it published; but he had writ    
it, and read it to us
several times.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you go to Church, Mistress?

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What will you ask her?

<pagebreak id="43" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, he lodged there where I lived.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know he writ that in the Intelligence my    
Mistress spoke of; <font>Thomson</font> ,
in his Intelligence, accusing him of having spoken Treason, he read  
what he said
he would put into the Intelligence: That he never spake one word of  
Treason, and
he writ it for his own vindication; that whereas <font>Nathaniel         
Thomson</font> , in his
Intelligence of the 18th. of <font>June</font> , had maliciously accused one  
<font>Bryan Haynes</font> of
Treasonable Words; there was no such thing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And that was to vindicate him, that he     
never did speak any
Treasonable Words. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you ask her any thing else?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell what she says.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Ch. Just.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She says, he writ something that was in    
Answer to <font>Thomson's</font>
Intelligence, to vindicate himself that he never did speak any       
Treasonable Words.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But did you hear him say any thing of these       
words, that he was employed
in a Plot against the Protestants?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I read that, in what he writ to put in the    
Intelligence, that he
challenged any one to appear, and charge him with Treason; but, said 
he, I own that
I was employed or had a hand in putting the Plot upon the dissenting 
Protestants:
and he telling my Mistress he had a Message from the King, offering  
him his
Pardon; I asked him why he did not accept the King's Pardon. Alas,   
said he, you
do not understand what I was to do for it; I was to do such base     
things so beneath
a Man, that I will never do them: I had five hundred Pounds offered  
me, besides
the King's Pardon, to do such base things as are beneath a Man to do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What were the base things he said he was to do,   
and would not do?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I cannot tell, he did not say to me what they 
were.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a Week before he was taken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Attorn. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is two Months ago.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was since the Parliament sat at <font>Oxford</font> :  
But what was that he was
employed to do, did he say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Richards.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, he said in his Answer to the             
Intelligence, he was one that bad
an hand to put the Plot upon the dissenting Protestants.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Wingfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, very well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you know of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Wingfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know nothing of him, but he is an      
honest Man; he married
my Daughter, and always carried himself like a Gentleman; he scorns  
the thing
that is unhandsome, and never did any thing that is unhandsome in my 
life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, how came you by this Witness? Have 
you any more of
them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I never saw her before, but I believe she hath    
said something else in
another place. Did you ever say the contrary, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Wingfield.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No body can say so; and I had done the

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We set forward the <font>3d</font> day of <font>August</font>

you came to <font>Lond.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I think we came in on the Thursday after.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Road on Sunday. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
Was that the first time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes. He had been at <font>York</font> , and went         
further, and afterwards
came to us. </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did you come from <font>York</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> About the Thursday before, if I be not mistaken.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was it in a week before? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>  
Yes, within a week it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you and Mr. <font>Bolron</font> came together?   
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And you left <font>Mr. Smith</font> behind?        
</dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And he overtook you upon the Road.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes: He was to go further into the North as     
soon as the Tryal of
Sir <font>Miles Stapleton</font> was over, and therefore he did very much     
importune
me to stay in the Countrey till he came to go up with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What day was the Tryal of Sir <font>Miles     
Stapleton</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> On the Monday before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>S. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are sure of that, &amp; that Mr. <font>Smith</font>     
went further into the North. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I see him take Horse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But he did not come into the Company of   
you and Mr.
<font>Bolron</font> till the Sunday after that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> See ye, Sir, He did desire me to stay in the    
Countrey till he
came, for he had a business of great concernment to impart to me,    
but it
would be a week or a fortnight ere he came, but yet he came in a     
shorter
time, for he said, he had received a Letter that brought him up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serg. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are sure of this? </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now then, I ask you, where was that place   
that he met with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At <font>Wentbridge</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then you came from thence towards         
<font>London</font> the next day?    </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now would I desire to know of you, for I   
perceive he did attack you to say
<pagebreak id="61" />
something against Sir <font>John Brooks</font> , and finding that you could   
not do it, because you had
no Acquaintance, he applied himself to <font>Bolron</font> . I would know,    
was it between that place
and <font>London</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And after the <font>3d.</font> of <font>August</font> ?      
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was after we set out.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought it had been the <font>24th.</font> of     
<font>July</font> that you set out, and continued your
Journey the 25, 26, 27, 28, &amp; <font>29th.</font> Alas, we have lost a great   
deal of time between Mr.
<font>Bolron</font> and Mr. <font>Mowbray</font> . <font>Bolron</font> said, it was the         
<font>25th.</font> they lay at such a place, and you are
gotten to the <font>3d.</font> of <font>August</font> ; you are mistaken certainly, as 
to point of time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> See, Sir, I will look in my Almanack, 'tis all 
set down there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let us see now if your <font>Oxford</font> Journey be  
as well set down, as your Journey to <font>Lond.</font> is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here is my Almanack, Sir. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Here, look upon his Almanack.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Jones</font> , I don't care for his     
Almanack, I had rather <font>Mr. Mow.</font> and <font>Mr.
Bolron</font> could bring their Almanacks together, and I would have them 
compared to see whether
the <font>3d.</font> of <font>August</font> in one be the <font>25th.</font> of <font>July</font> in the 
other. Did you Discourse with him upon
the Road the <font>3d</font> of <font>August</font> , and not before, and <font>Bolron</font>   
that came up with you, Discourse with
him the <font>25th.</font> of <font>July</font> ? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am mistaken, I  
find.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, that you are, one of you most grosly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> See, Sir, here is my Almanack, whereby I find  
that it is my mistake; but pray see,
Sir, here it is set down, the day we came out was the 24. the day we 
came to <font>London</font> was the 27.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How didst thou set out the 3 of <font>August</font> 
from that place, and yet come to <font>London</font>
the <font>27th.</font> of <font>July</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will refer my self to <font>Mr. Smith</font> , as to  
the time we came up, &amp; here is my Almanack.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will believe thy Almanack to speak       
truth, though it have never so many
Errors about the Changes of the Weather, sooner than I will believe  
thee.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I perceive the man is mistaken in the moneth and  
the time; but pray my Lord will
you please to see, for Justice sake, if the Almanack be new writ.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you, here is the matter,                  
<font>Mr Colledge</font> , he was asked again, and again, what
day it was, and he was positive to the <font>3d.</font> of <font>August</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was mistaken, but his Almanack is right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He speaks rashly, that is the best can be said.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was a mistake of mine, Sir <font>George</font> , but 
my Almanack is right.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, <font>Mr. Mowbray</font> , don't enter into  
Dialogues with me, I only make a 
little Observation upon your Almanack. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was     
only my mistake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are a rash man to affirm so: If you had an 
Almanack, you should have
consulted it, or referred to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Ser. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, we have lost a day even by your     
Almanack; for yours says, it was
the <font>27th.</font> you came to Town, <font>Bolron</font> the <font>28th.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I refer my self to <font>Mr. Smith</font> , he can't    
deny, but he came up with us at that time. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You were examined at Sir <font>Miles           
Stapletons</font> Tryal, was you not, <font>Mr. Mowbray</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was an Evidence there.                       
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. S. Jeff.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Jury believe you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They did acquit Sir <font>Miles Stapleton</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That is nothing to the purpose; so was            
<font>Mr. Smith</font> too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would you ask any thing further?               
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>Mrs. Mary Bolron</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you have any more Witnesses, pray call them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Mowbray</font> , was <font>Mr. Bolron's</font> 
Wife by when this Discourse was?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Mow.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, she was in Town, she did not go down with  
him at all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you <font>Mr. Bolron's</font> Wife?                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bolron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, what do you ask her? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>     
<font>Mrs. Bolron</font> , Pray do you know <font>Mr. John Smith</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do know him. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can  
you say of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He sent several times for my Husband and      
<font>Mr. Mowbray</font> to my House, something
he would have them be concerned in, some business he had in hand.    
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When was that?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within this 3 weeks, since he came up from    
<font>York</font> Assizes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coll.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You may see there was an understanding between    
them then.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did they go accordingly?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Bol.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now and then they have gone to him, but they  
knew his business, because they
had Discourse with him, as they said, upon the Road, and they would  
not go.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Would you ask her any thing else? What do you  
know more?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Bolron.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nothing, for I am not one that stirs much   
abroad.

Author; but I heard a man
was in trouble about them, upon a By-Law in the <font>Stationers</font>       
Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came you by that Original?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you it there? I know of none was         
produced. But if I were a
person concerned, it were no Treason; and, my Lord, I hope you will  
do me that Justice,
to let the Jury know they are not Treason, none of these Papers. And 
I do declare I
know nothing of the Original, the Printer, nor the Author.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You spend time in making Observations out of   
order of time: when you
have given your Evidence, then make your Observations.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess I may erre as to matter of Order,   
for I was never in this
capacity before. But pray do you tell the Court how the Papers came  
there, and all the
transactions. For I was a Prisoner when they came and searched.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, it was eight weeks before you were taken   
they were left there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you tell your Master soon      
after they were left there?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Within what time did you tell him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe it was a week or a fortnight.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where was your Master all that time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He was in the Countrey.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I did see them there, I must         
confess, I do not deny but I saw them
there, but I knew not whence they came, nor whose they were. Nor did 
I ever intend
to meddle with them, nor concern my self about them. What have you   
to say more?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Concerning Mr. <font>Dugdale</font>                    
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: <font>Dugdgale</font> </comment> , if I may speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, go on.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I went to receive the Money of <font>Mr.          
Dugdale</font> that he owed my Master, and
asking him for it, he said, he would pay me such a time to morrow    
morning if I would
come for it; but when I came, he had not the Money ready for me.     
Sir, said I, I think 'tis
very hard that you should keep my Masters Money from him, and yet    
you go and Swear
against his Life too: what do you think we shall do at home in the   
Family, if you keep
my Masters Money and he be in Prison? Said he, There is a great deal 
of do about my
Swearing against your Master, more than needs; but as I hope for     
Salvation, I do not
believe <font>Mr. Colledge</font> had any more hand in any Conspiracy against 
His Majesty, than the
Child unborn. Here is <font>Dugdale</font> , let him deny it if he can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Dugdale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I hope for Salvation I did not say so.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Salvation 'tis true what I say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Stephens.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was the Maid that hid her Masters papers 
when they were searched
for.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be quiet; art thou got into         
Dialogues with the Maid now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Stevens</font> , 'tis well known what a man  
you are to propagate Witnesses.
My Lord, she gave me an account of this in the <font>Tower</font> , before I  
came away, that
<font>Dugdale</font> desired to speak with Mr. <font>Smith</font> , and told her, that 
nothing that he had to say would
touch my Life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As I am alive 'tis true.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Dugdale</font> denies it now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He is not a right man if he denies it, for he 
told it me twice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I told Mr. <font>Smith</font> of it, when he had leave 
to come to me: I told him what
the Maid said he had said to her, and this was three weeks ago; said 
he, I will speak
with him with all my heart, if he has a mind to speak with me; for   
he hath said
that he hath nothing against her Master that can touch an hair of    
his head, nor nothing
that can touch his Life, that he knew nothing of a Plot or           
contrivance against the King;
and if I could help it, I had as lieve have given a hundred pound I  
had never spoken
what I have. This he said to her.
<pagebreak id="76" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You tell her what to say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, he does not tell me, for Mr. <font>Dugdale</font> 
said those very things to me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is an account I had when I was a         
Prisoner, I could not direct her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you deny what they say to be true, Mr.      
<font>Dugdale</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Dugdale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, she came to me for money; I told  
her I had it not ready, but
would pay her: And in the shop, before the Apprentice-boy, she       
desired of me that I
would write two or three words what I had to say against her Master, 
and I told Mr.
<font>Graham</font> of it. So, said I, I cannot tell, I have not the Papers,  
nor what Informations
I have given against him. So she came again the next morning, and    
she was at me to
write down what I said. I wonder, said I, your Master will send you! 
had not he as
good send Mr. <font>Smith</font> , who is his Counsel? And this was all the   
words we had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I do solemnly assure you, he said he 
would write down what he
had said against my Master, and would fain speak with Mr.            
<font>Smith</font> , for there was more
ado made about it than needs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Dugdale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Graham</font> can tell what it was; for I 
came and told him
immediately.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you tell her you had nothing to say        
against her Master that would touch
his life?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Dugdale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could not say that I had said nothing    
against her Master, for she
asked me that I would write down what I had said; but I told her I   
knew not what
was Treason, that must be referred to the Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did he speak it openly or privately to 
you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He did not speak it aloud; no body heard him  
but my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Dugdale.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was in the shop, and the Apprentice-boy 
was by.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Levins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was this after he had been at the     
<font>Old-bayly</font> , or before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was after he had been at the          
<font>Old-bayly</font> , and after he had been at
<font>Oxon</font> too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Levins.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then it was before the Court what     
could be made of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She hath gone forty times for the money I     
lent him out of my pocket; and
I lent him that, when I had little more my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Hunt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I did tell him, Mr. <font>Dugdale</font> , if you       
can't let me have my Masters money, if
you please to tell me what you have made Oath against my Master.     
Said he, I can't
let thee have it now; but thou shalt have what I have to say against 
him: I will draw
it up in Writing, and thou shalt have it to morrow-morning. The next 
morning I
came to him again, and said I, I am come again, what must I do? Said 
he, I have no
money, such an one hath not hoped me to it. Sir, then, said I, I     
hope you will be as
good as your word, to let me know what you have made Oath against my 
Master.
Said he, I was about it yesterday, but could not do it: But,         
Sweetheart, said he, (and
took me by the hand) I will give you a Copy of it to day at ten of   
the clock; and if I
do not, I will tell it thee by word of mouth. So I came to the house 
at ten, and staid
till eleven, but did not see him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Just. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You had a great mind to be tampering.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>El. Jones.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The first time, he asked me who was his      
Counsel; I told him, Mr. <font>Smith</font> ;
then said he, I have a great desire to speak with him: So I told my  
Master of it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, you see it is but black and white,   
all this whole contrivance upon
me. She hath proved I knew nothing of these Papers, and indeed I did 
not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you call any more Witnesses?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There is my Brother-in-law that received      
those Papers. Call <font>George Spur</font>
and <font>Sarah Godwin</font> .

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you know any thing of the Papers that were 
carried to my Brother
<font>George Spurrs</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I do. The Saturday after my Brothers 
Confinement, about
eight of the clock in the morning, I having heard of it, came into   
the House, and in a
quarter of an hours time, in comes a Waterman and desires an handful 
or two of shavings.
I knowing not who he was, nor what he desired them for, told him, he 
should have them;
so he went up to the working shop to gather them, for he pretended   
that to be his 
business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whose Waterman was it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Waterman I suppose that belonged to His 
Majesty, for he had a Coat
marked with <font>R. C.</font>
<pagebreak id="77" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This is after I was in Custody.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, it was the Saturday after. So no     
sooner had he the shavings,
but he goes out of the Shop, and comes in again with Three of His    
Majesties 
Messengers, and they made enquiry after papers, and I being innocent 
of concealing any
papers, or any thing said I knew of none, so they came to one box    
that had the Tooles
for the men to work with, and they demanded the keys. I told him, I  
knew not where
the keys were. So they went to the next and found it open, but       
nothing did they find
there, there was a Bed wherein formerly my Brothers Servants did     
lye. Said one to the
other, Look well whether there be not something hid in that bed,     
said I, I suppose there
is no such thing as you inquire for: if you please, you may take off 
the Cloths, and
gave them free toleration to look, but for the Chest, I would not    
deliver the keys,
because the man was not there that owned it. In their searching,      
they flung down the
Wainscote, and did a great deal of damage to his Goods. Gentlemen,   
said I, I
suppose you have Order to search, but none to spoil a mans Goods.    
When they were
gone, having found none, they threatned God dam them they would have 
them, for
there they were. But I being ignorant of the concealment of the      
papers, I requested
the Maid and my Brothers Son, whether they knew of any papers, and   
they satisfied me
they knew of some prints that were brought by a Porter, to be left   
at my Brothers,
but they knew not whence they came, nor what they were: and the same 
answer gave
my Brothers Son, that he did not know whose the papers were. But     
since his Fathers
Confinement, they were laid up sure and safe, for they knew not what 
they concerned.
Upon this, my Lord, my Brother-in-law <font>George Spur</font> , he comes     
into the house, and if it
please your Honour, I requested him to carry them into the Countrey  
to his house, to
secure them till we knew what they did concern, and who they did     
belong to.
Whereupon he replyed, my Lord, That he was fearful to carry any      
thing out of the house;
said I, If you will please to take them of me, I will carry them out 
of the house for your
security, because his Wife looked every hour (being with Child) when 
she should be
delivered, and he was fearful of troubling her. So I carried them    
out of the house,
and delivered them to him. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To my Brother-in-law <font>Mr. George         
Spur</font> . So at my going out, after I
had delivered them to him, in my way back again, I found a small     
paper-Book, and a
small parcel of Writings, who dropped them, or who laid them there,  
I cannot tell. But
taking them up unadvisedly, I put them among the prints, which I     
carried out; I
delivered them to my Brother-in-law. This is all I have to say as to 
the papers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Stevens.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three parts of what she hath said is false.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, hold you your tongue.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Stevens.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Mr. Atterbury</font> is here, my Lord, that       
searched the house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Be pleased to give me my Oath, I will tell   
you what passed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Att. Gen.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We don't think it material, but you were  
Sworn before, stand up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tell the manner of finding the papers. This    
woman gives us an account of
a Waterman that came in, pretending to fetch shavings.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Oath it was not so. The Waterman was 
a Waterman that
brought me and two more of my Fellows, and the Waterman followed us  
into the
yard but came after us: and being ordered to look for papers, I did  
search the House;
for I had Intelligence that there were papers there, but I did not   
find them there. But
upon finding the first papers, I made the more diligent search, but  
could not find the rest
I most chiefly sought after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did the Kings Waterman take any    
shavings by himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We were all together, we did not move out of 
any one Room, but
together, this Gentlewoman was in the house when I came, and there   
was a little Child,
a Girl, and this Maid was there.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did you come for shavings there,   
pray <font>Mr. Atterbury</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Atterbury.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I did not. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The   
Waterman did though first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>George Spur</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech> (But he did not     
appear.) </nonSpeech><dialogue> But <font>Mr. Atterbury</font> , before you go
down, pray tell the Court, did you take any of these papers at my    
house, or at my
Brother-in-law <font>Spurs</font> house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sewel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I took the papers, and I took them at   
<font>Bushy</font> at <font>Spur's</font> house. And
this woman carried out one half to <font>Spur</font> , and the Maid carried   
out the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When did he carry them?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The same day they searched for them, for  
my Brother came in at the
same time. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How do you know <font>Spur</font> carried any   
away?
<pagebreak id="78" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He carried none out of the house, I       
carried them out of the house and
delivered them to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then they were in your house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Goodwin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They were in the Counting-house.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, If they were in any other place, I   
know not how they came there,
for this was all done after I was a Prisoner, and <font>Sewel</font> says     
they were removed when I
was a Prisoner. Where is <font>George Spur</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Serj. Jefferies.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is admitted they were at your   
house, and taken thence, and
afterwards carried to <font>Spurs</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They carried them abroad and handed them from 
one to another, and took
them into the Countrey, I know not what they did with them, but, my  
Lord, I
neither know the Printer nor the Author, I declare it upon my life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. C. J.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you any more Witnesses?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Colledge.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, my Lord, I have not.
