<pagebreak id="2" />
   <nonSpeech>As concerning <font>William Durent</font> ,
being an Infant, his Mother
<pagebreak id="3" />
<font>Dorothy Durent</font> sworn and examined
deposed in open Court, That
about the Tenth of <font>March, <foreign>Nono
Caroli Secundi</foreign> </font> , she having a special
occasion to go from home, and
having none in her House to take
care of her said Child (it then
sucking) desired <font>Amy Duny</font> her
Neighbour, to look to her Child
during her absence, for which
she promised her to give her a
Penny: but the said <font>Dorothy
Durent</font> desired the said <font>Amy</font> not to
Suckle her Child, and laid a great
charge upon her not to do it. 
Upon which it was asked by the
Court, why she did give that
direction, she being an old Woman
and not capable of giving Suck?
It was answered by the said
<font>Dorothy Durent</font> , that she very well
knew that she did not give Suck,
but that for some years before;
<pagebreak id="4" />
she had gone under the 
Reputation of a <font>Witch</font> , which was one
cause made her give her the
caution: Another was, That it was
customary with old Women, that
if they did look after a sucking
Child, and nothing would please
it but the Breast, they did use to
please the Child to give it the
Breast, and it did please the Child,
but it sucked nothing but Wind,
which did the Child hurt.
Nevertheless after the departure of
this Deponent, the said <font>Amy</font> did
Suckle the Child: And after
the return of the said <font>Dorothy</font> , the
said <font>Amy</font> did acquaint her, <font>That
she had given Suck to the Child</font>
contrary to her command. 
Whereupon the Deponent was very
angry with the said <font>Amy</font> for the 
same; at which the said <font>Amy</font> was
much discontented, and used
<pagebreak id="5" />
many high Expressions and
Threatning Speeches towards her; 
telling her, <font>That she had as good to
have done otherwise than to have found
fault with her, and so departed out of
her House</font> : And that very Night
her Son fell into strange fits of
swounding, and was held in such
terrible manner, that she was
much affrighted therewith, and
so continued for divers weeks.
And the said Examinant farther
said, that she being exceedingly
troubled at her Childs 
Distemper, did go to a certain Person
named Doctor <font>Jacob</font> , who lived
at <font>Yarmouth</font> , who had the
reputation in the Country, to help
children that were Bewitch'd;
who advis'd her to hang up the
Childs Blanket in the
Chimney-corner all day, and at night when
she put the Child to Bed, to put
<pagebreak id="6" />
it into the said blanket, and if she
found any thing in it, she should
not be afraid, but to throw it 
into the Fire. And this Deponent
did according to his direction;
and at night when she took down
the Blanket with an intent to put
her Child therein, there fell out
of the same a great Toad, which 
ran up and down the hearth, and
she having a young youth only
with her in the House, desired 
him to catch the Toad, and throw
it into the Fire, which the youth
did accordingly, and held it there
with the Tongs; and as soon
as it was in the Fire it made a
great and horrible Noise, and
after a space there was a flashing
in the Fire like Gun-powder,
making a noise like the discharge
of a Pistol, and thereupon the
Toad was no more seen nor
<pagebreak id="7" />
heard. It was asked by the Court,
if that after the noise and flashing,
there was not the Substance of
the Toad to be seen to consume
in the fire? And it was answered
by the said <font>Dorothy Durent</font> , that
after the flashing and noise, there
was no more seen than if there
had been none there. The next
day there came a young Woman
a Kinswoman of the said <font>Amy</font> , and
a neighbour of this Deponent, and
told this Deponent, that her Aunt
(meaning the said <font>Amy</font> ) was in
a most lamentable condition 
having her face all scorched with
fire, and that she was sitting alone
in her House, in her smock 
without any fire. And thereupon
this Deponent went into the
House of the said <font>Amy Duny</font> to
see her, and found her in the same
condition as was related to her;
<pagebreak id="8" />
for her Face, her Leggs, and
Thighs, which this Deponent
saw, seemed very much scorched
and burnt with Fire, at which
this Deponent seemed much to
wonder. And asked the said
<font>Amy</font> how she came into that sad
condition? and the said <font>Amy</font>
replied, she might thank her for it,
for that she this Deponent was the
cause thereof, but that she should
live to see some of her Children
dead, and she upon Crutches.
And this Deponent farther saith,
that after the burning of the said
Toad, her Child recover'd, and
was well again, and was living 
at the time of the Assizes. And
this Deponent farther saith, That
about the <font>6th.</font> of <font>March</font> , 11=o= <font>Car.</font> 2.
her Daughter <font>Elizabeth Durent</font> ,
being about the Age of Ten Years,
was taken in like manner as her
<pagebreak id="9" />
first Child was, and in her fits
complained much of <font>Amy Duny</font> ,
and said, That she did appear to
her, and Afflict her in such
manner as the former. And she this
Deponent going to the 
Apothecaries for some thing for her said
Child, when she did return to
her own House, she found the
said <font>Amy Duny</font> there, and asked
her what she did do there? and
her answer was, <font>That she came
to see her Child, and to give it some
water</font> . But she this Deponent
was very angry with her, and
thrust her forth of her doors, and
when she was out of doors, she
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>You need not be so angry, for
your Child will not live long</font> : </dialogue><nonSpeech>and
this was on a <font>Saturday</font> , and the
Child dyed on the <font>Monday</font> 
following. The cause of whose
Death this Deponent verily
<pagebreak id="10" />
believeth was occasion'd by the
Witchcraft of the said <font>Amy Duny</font> :
for that the said <font>Amy</font> hath been
long reputed to be a <font>Witch</font> , and
a person of very evil behaviour,
whose Kindred and Relations
have been many of them accused
for <font>Witchcraft</font> , and some of them
have been Condemned.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The said Deponent further
saith, that not long after the death
of her Daughter <font>Elizabeth
Durent</font> , she this Deponent was taken
with a Lameness in both her
Leggs, from the knees 
downward, that she was fain to go
upon Cruches, and that she had no
other use of them but only to
bear a little upon them till she
did remove her Crutches, and so 
continued till the time of the 
Assizes, that the <font>Witch</font> came to be
Tryed, and was there upon her
<pagebreak id="11" />
Crutches; the Court asked her,
<font>That at the time she was taken with
this Lameness, if it were with her
according to the Custom of Women</font> ?
Her Answer was, that it was so,
and that she never had any
stoppages of those things, but when
she was with Child.</nonSpeech>

<pagebreak id="15" />
 <head> <font>THE EVIDENCE WHICH WAS GIVEN
CONCERNING THESE TWO CHILDREN
WAS TO THIS EFFECT.</font> </head>  
   <nonSpeech> <font>Samuel Pacy</font> a Merchant of
<font>Leystoff</font> aforesaid, (a man who
carried himself with much 
soberness during the Tryal, from
whom proceeded no words
either of Passion or Malice, though
his Children were so greatly
Afflicted) , Sworn and Examined,
Deposeth, That his younger
Daughter <font>Deborah</font> , upon <font>Thursday</font>
the Tenth of <font>October</font> last, was
suddenly taken with a Lameness
in her Leggs, so that she could
not stand, neither had she any
strength in her Limbs to support
her, and so she continued until
the Seventeenth day of the same
<pagebreak id="16" />
Month, which day being fair and
Sunshiny, the Child desired to be
carryed on the <font>East</font> part of the
House, to be set upon the Bank
which looketh upon the Sea;
and whil'st she was sitting there,
<font>Amy Duny</font> came to this Deponents
House to buy some Herrings, but
being denyed she went away
discontented, and presently
returned again, and was denyed,
and likwise the third time and
was denyed as at first; and at
her last going away, she went
away grumbling; but what she
said was not perfectly 
understood. But at the very same
instant of time, the said Child
was taken with most violent fits,
feeling most extream pain in her
Stomach, like the pricking of
Pins, and Shreeking out in a most
dreadful manner like unto a
<pagebreak id="17" />
Whelp, and not like unto a
sensible Creature. And in this
extremity the Child continued to the
great grief of the Parents until
the Thirtieth of the same Month.
During this time this Deponent
sent for one Dr. <font>Feavor</font> , a Doctor
of Physick, to take his advice
concerning his Childs Distemper; the
Doctor being come, he saw the
Child in those fits, but could not
conjecture (as he then told this
Deponent, and afterwards 
affirmed in open Court, at this Tryal)
what might be the cause of the
Childs Affliction. And this
Deponent farther saith, That by
reason of the circumstances aforesaid,
and in regard <font>Amy Duny</font> is a
Woman of an ill Fame, &amp; commonly
reported to be <font>Witch</font> &amp; <font>Sorceress</font> ,
and for that the said Child in her
fits would cry out of <font>Amy Duny</font> as
<pagebreak id="18" />
the cause of her Malady, and that
she did affright her with
Apparitions of her Person (as the Child
in the intervals of her fits related)
he this Deponent did suspect the
said <font>Amy Duny</font> for a <font>Witch</font> , and
charged her with the injury and
wrong to his Child, and caused
her to be set in the Stocks on the
Twenty eighth of the same
<font>October</font> : and during the time of her
continuance there, one <font>Alice
Letteridge</font> and <font>Jane Buxton</font> 
demanding of her (as they also affirmed in
Court upon their Oathes) what
should be the reason of Mr.
<font>Pacy's</font> Childs Distemper? telling
her, That she was suspected to be 
the cause thereof; she replyed,</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Mr.</font> Pacy <font>keeps a great stir about
his Child, but let him stay until he
hath done as much by his Children, as
I have done by mine</font> . </dialogue><nonSpeech>And being
<pagebreak id="19" />
further examined, what she had
done to her Children? She
answered, <font>That she had been fain to
open her Child's Mouth with a Tap to
give it Victuals</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And the said Deponent further
deposeth, That within two days
after speaking of the said words
being the Thirtieth of <font>October</font> , the
eldest Daughter <font>Elizabeth</font> , fell into
extream fits, insomuch, that they
could not open her Mouth to
give her breath, to preserve her
Life without the help of a Tap
which they were enforced to use;
and the younger Child was in the
like manner Afflicted, so that they
used the same also for her
Relief.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And further the said Children
being grievously afflicted would
severally complain in their
extremity, and also in the intervals,
<pagebreak id="20" />
That <font>Amy Duny</font> (together with
one other Woman whose person
and Cloathes they described) did
thus Afflict them, their
Apparitions appearing before them, to
their great terrour and 
affrightment: And sometimes they
would cry out, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>There stands</font>
Amy Duny, <font>and there</font> Rose
Cullender; </dialogue><nonSpeech>the other Person 
troubling them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Their fits were various, 
sometimes they would be lame on one
side of their Bodies, sometimes
on the other: sometimes a
soreness over their whole Bodies, so
as they could endure none to
touch them: at other times they
would be restored to the perfect
use of their Limbs, and deprived
of their Hearing; at other times
of their Sight, at other times of
their Speech; sometimes by the
<pagebreak id="21" />
space of one day, sometimes for
two; and once they were
wholly deprived of their Speech for
Eight days together, and then
restored to their Speech again. At
other times they would fall into
Swounings, and upon the
recovery to their Speech they would 
Cough extreamly, and bring up
much Flegme, and with the same
crooked Pins, and one time a
Two-penny Nail with a very
broad head, which Pins
(amounting to Forty or more) together
with the Two-penny Nail were 
produced in Court, with the
affirmation of the said Deponent,
that he was present when the said
Nail was Vomited up, and also
most of the Pins. Commonly
at the end of every fit they would
cast up a Pin, and sometimes they
would have four or five fits in
one day.</nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="22" />
   <nonSpeech>In this manner the said
Children continued with this 
Deponent for the space of two Months,
during which time in their
Intervals this Deponent would cause
them to Read some Chapters in
the <font>New Testament</font> . Whereupon
this Deponent several times
observed, that they would read till
they came to the Name of Lord,
or Jesus, or Christ; and then
before they could pronounce either
of the said Words they would
suddenly fall into their fits. But
when they came to the Name of
Satan, or Devil, they would clap
their Fingers upon the Book,
crying out,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>This bites, but makes me
speak right well</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>At such time as they be
recovered out of their fits (occasion'd
as this Deponent conceives upon
their naming of Lord, or Jesus, or
<pagebreak id="23" />
Christ) , this Deponent hath
demanded of them, what is the
cause they cannot pronounce
those words, They reply and say,
<font>That</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Amy Duny <font>saith, I must not
use that name</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>And farther, the said Children
after their fits were past, would
tell, how that <font>Amy Duny</font> , and
<font>Rose Cullender</font> would appear
before them, holding their Fists at
them, threatning, <font>That if they
related either what they saw or heard,
that they would Torment them Ten
times more than ever they did
before</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>In their fits they would cry out,
<font>There stands</font> Amy Duny, <font>or</font> Rose
Cullender; and sometimes in one
place and sometimes in another,
running with great violence to
the place where they fancied
them to stand, striking at them as
<pagebreak id="24" />
if they were present; they would
appear to them sometimes 
spinning, and sometimes reeling, or
in other postures, deriding or
threatning them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And this Deponent farther
saith, That his Children being
thus Tormented by all the space
aforesaid, and finding no hopes
of amendment, he sent them to
his Sisters House, one <font>Margaret
Arnold</font> , who lived at <font>Yarmouth</font> , to
make tryal, whether the change
of the Air might do them any
good. And how, and in what
manner they were afterwards
held, he this Deponent refers
himself to the Testimony of his
said Sister.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Margaret Arnold</font> , Sworn and
Examined, saith, That the said
<font>Elizabeth</font> and <font>Deborah Pacy</font> came
to her House about the
<pagebreak id="25" />
Thirtieth of <font>November</font> last, her Brother
acquainted her, that he thought
they were Bewitch'd, for that
they vomited Pins; and farther
Informed her of the several
passages which occurred at his own
House. This Deponent said,
that she gave no credit to that
which was related to her,
conceiving possibly the Children
might use some deceit in putting
Pins in their mouths themselves.
Wherefore this Deponent 
unpinned all their Cloathes, and left
not so much as one Pin upon
them, but sewed all the Clothes
they wore, instead of pinning of
them. But this Deponent saith,
that notwithstanding all this care
and circumspection of hers, the
Children afterwards raised at
several times at least Thirty Pins in
her presence, and had most fierce
<pagebreak id="26" />
and violent Fitts upon them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>The Children would in their
Fitts cry out against <font>Rose
Cullender</font> and <font>Amy Duny</font> , affirming that
they saw them; and they
threatned to Torment them Ten times
more, if they complained of them.
At some times the Children
(only) would see things run up
and down the House in the
appearance of Mice; and one of
them suddainly snapt one with
the Tongs, and threw it into
the fire, and it screeched out like
a Rat.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At another time, the younger
Child being out of her Fitts went
out of Doors to take a little fresh
Air, and presently a little thing
like a Bee flew upon her Face,
and would have gone into her
Mouth, whereupon the Child
ran in all haste to the door to get
<pagebreak id="27" />
into the House again, screeking
out in a most terrible manner;
whereupon, this Deponent made
haste to come to her, but before
she could get to her, the Child
fell into her swooning Fitt, and
at last with much pain straining
herself, she vomited up a 
Two-penny Nail with a broad Head;
and after that the Child had
raised up the Nail she came to her
understanding; and being
demanded by this Deponent, how
she came by the Nail? she
Answered, <font>That the Bee brought this
Nail and forced it into her Mouth</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And at other times, the Elder
Child declared unto this
Deponent, that during the time of her
Fitts, she saw Flies come unto her,
and bring with them in their
Mouthes crooked Pins; and
after the Child had thus declared
<pagebreak id="28" />
the same, she fell again into
violent Fits, and afterwards raised
several Pins.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At another time, the said Elder 
Child declared unto this 
Deponent, and sitting by the Fire
suddainly started up and said, <font>she saw
a Mouse</font> , and she crept under the
Table looking after it, and at
length, she put something in her
Apron, saying, <font>she had caught it</font> ;
and immediatly she ran to the 
Fire and threw it in, and there
did appear upon it to this 
Deponent, like the flashing of
Gunpowder, though she confessed
she saw nothing in the Childs
Hand.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At another time the said Child
being speechless, but otherwise,
of perfect understanding, ran
round about the House holding
her Apron, crying</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>hush, hush</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>as
<pagebreak id="29" />
if there had been some Poultrey
in the House; but this Deponent
could perceive nothing: but at
last she saw the Child stoop as
if she had catch't at something,
and put it into her Apron, and
afterwards made as if she had
thrown it into the Fire: but this
Deponent could not discover any
thing: but the Child afterwards
being restored to her speech, she
this Deponent demanded of her
what she saw at the time she used
such a posture? who answered,
<font>That she saw a Duck</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At another time, the Younger
daughter being recovered out of
her Fitts, declared, <font>That</font> Amy
Duny <font>had been with her, and that
she tempted her to Drown her self,
and to cut her Throat, or otherwise
to Destroy her self</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>At another time in their Fitts
<pagebreak id="30" />
they both of them cryed out 
upon <font>Rose Cullender</font> and <font>Amy Duny</font> ,
complaining against them;</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Why
do not you come your selves, but send
your Imps to Torment us</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>These several passages as most
remarkable, the said Deponent
did particularly set down as they 
daily happen'd, and for the
reasons aforesaid, she doth verily
believe in her conscience, that the
Children were bewitched, and
by the said <font>Amy Duny</font> , and <font>Rose
Cullender</font> ; though at first she could
hardly be induced to believe it.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>As concerning <font>Ann Durent</font> , one
other of the Parties, supposed to
be bewitched, present in Court.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Edmund Durent</font> her Father
Sworn and Examined; said, That
he also lived in the said, Town 
of <font>Leystoff</font> , and that the said
<font>Rose Cullender</font> , about the latter
<pagebreak id="31" />
end of <font>November</font> last, came into
this Deponents House to buy
some Herrings of his Wife, but
being denyed by her, the said 
<font>Rose</font> returned in a discontented
manner; and upon the first of
<font>December</font> after, his Daughter <font>Ann
Durent</font> was very sorely Afflicted
in her Stomach, and felt great
pain, like the pricking of Pins,
and then fell into swooning fitts,
and after the Recovery from her
Fitts, she declared, <font>That she had
seen the Apparition of the said</font> Rose,
<font>who threatned to Torment her</font> . In
this manner she continued from
the first of <font>December</font> , until this
present time of Tryal; having
likewise vomited up divers Pins
(produced here in Court) . This
Maid was present in Court, but
could not speak to declare her
knowledge, but fell into most
<pagebreak id="32" />
violent fits when she was brought
before <font>Rose Cullender</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ann Baldwin</font> Sworn and
Examined, Deposeth the same thing
as touching the Bewitching of
the said <font>Ann Durent</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>As concerning <font>Jane Bocking</font>
who was so weak, she could not
be brought to the Assizes.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Diana Bocking</font> Sworn and
Examined, Deposed, That she lived
in the same Town of <font>Leystoff</font> ,
and that her said Daughter 
having been formerly Afflicted with
swooning fitts recovered well of
them, and so continued for a
certain time; and upon the First of
<font>February</font> last, she was taken also
with great pain in her Stomach,
like pricking with Pins; and 
afterwards fell into swooning fitts
and so continued till the
Deponents coming to the Assizes,
<pagebreak id="33" />
having during the same time taken
little or no food, but daily
vomiting crooked Pins; and upon
Sunday last raised Seven Pins.
And whilst her fits were upon her
she would spread forth her Arms
with her hands open, and use
postures as if she catched at 
something, and would instantly close
her hands again; which being
immediatly forced open, they found
several Pins diversly crooked, but
could neither see nor perceive
how or in what manner they
were conveyed thither. At
another time, the same <font>Jane</font> being in
another of her fitts, talked as if
she were discoursing with some
persons in the Room, (though
she would give no answer nor
seem to take notice of any
person then present) and would in
like manner cast abroad her
<pagebreak id="34" />
Arms, saying,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I will not have it,
I will not have it</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>and at last she
said,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Then I will have it</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>and so
waving her Arm with her hand
open, she would presently close
the same, which instantly forced
open, they found in it a 
Lath-Nail. In her fitts she would
frequently complain of <font>Rose
Cullender</font> and <font>Amy Duny</font> , saying, That
<font>now she saw</font> Rose Cullender 
<font>standing at the Beds feet, and another time
at the Beds-head, and so in other
places</font> . At last she was stricken
Dumb and could not speak one
Word, though her fitts were not
upon her, and so she continued
for some days, and at last her
speech came to her again, and she
desired her Mother to get her
some Meat; and being
demanded the reason why she could
not speak in so long time? She
<pagebreak id="35" />
answered, <font>That</font> Amy Duny <font>would
not suffer her to speak</font> . This
Lath-Nail, and divers of the Pins were
produced in Court.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>As concerning <font>Susan Chandler</font> ,
one other of the Parties 
supposed to be Bewitched and 
present in Court.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mary Chandler</font> Mother of the
said <font>Susan</font> , Sworn and Examined,
Deposed and said, That about the
beginning of <font>February</font> last past,
the said <font>Rose Cullender</font> and <font>Amy
Duny</font> were Charged by Mr.
<font>Samuel Pacy</font> for Bewitching of his
Daughters. And a Warrant 
being granted at the request of the
said Mr. <font>Pacy</font> , by Sir <font>Edmund Bacon</font>
Baronet, one of the Justices of the 
Peace for the County of <font>Suffolk</font>
to bring them before him, and
they being brought before him
were Examined, and Confessed
<pagebreak id="36" />
nothing. He gave order that they
should be searched; whereupon
this Deponent with five others
were appointed to do the same:
and coming to the House of <font>Rose
Cullender</font> , they did acquaint her
with what they were come
about, and asked whether she was
contented that they should search
her? she did not oppose it, 
whereupon they began at her Head, and
so stript her naked, and in the
lower part of her Belly they
found a thing like a Teat of an
Inch long, they questioned her
about it, and she said, <font>That she
had got a strain by carrying of
water which caused that Excrescence</font> .
But upon narrower search, they
found in her Privy Parts three
more Excrescencies or Teats, but
smaller than the former: This
Deponent farther saith, That in
<pagebreak id="37" />
the long Teat at the end thereof
there was a little hole, and it
appeared unto them as if it had been
lately sucked, and upon the
straining of it there issued out white
milkie Matter.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>And this Deponent farther
saith, That her said Daughter
(being of the Age of Eighteen
Years) was then in Service in the
said Town of <font>Leystoff</font> , and 
rising up early the next Morning
to Wash, this <font>Rose Cullender</font> 
appeared to her, and took her by
the hand, whereat she was much
affrighted, and went forthwith to
her Mother, (being in the same
town) and acquainted her with
what she had seen; but being
extreamly terrified, she fell
extream sick, much grieved at her
Stomach; and that Night after
being in Bed with another young
<pagebreak id="38" />
Woman, she suddenly scrieked
out, and fell into such extream
fits as if she were distracted, 
crying against <font>Rose Cullender</font> ; saying,
<font>she would come to bed to her</font> . She
continued in this manner beating
and wearing her self, insomuch,
that this Deponent was glad to
get help to attend her. In her
Intervals she would declare, <font>That
some time she saw</font> Rose Cullender,
<font>at another time with a great Dog
with her</font> : She also vomited up
divers crooked Pins; and 
sometimes she was stricken with
blindness, and at another time
she was Dumb, and so she
appeared to be in Court when the 
Tryal of the Prisoners was; for
she was not able to speak her
knowledge; but being brought
into the Court at the Tryal, she
suddenly fell into her fits, and
<pagebreak id="39" />
being carryed out of the Court
again, within the space of half
an hour she came to her self and
recovered her speech, and
thereupon was immediatly brought
into the Court, and asked by the
Court, whether she was in
condition to take an Oath, and to
give Evidence, she said she could.
But when she was Sworn, and
asked what she could say against
either of the Prisoners? before she
could make any answer, she fell
into her fits, screeking out in a
miserable manner, crying</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Burn her,
burn her</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>which were all the
Words she could speak.</nonSpeech>

<pagebreak id="48" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>2ly.</font> One <font>John Soam</font> of <font>Leystoff</font>
aforesaid, Yeoman, a sufficient
Person, Deposeth, That not long
since, in harvest time he had three
Carts which brought home his
Harvest, and as they were going
<pagebreak id="49" />
into the Field to load, one of the
Carts wrenched the Window of
<font>Rose Cullenders</font> House, 
whereupon she came out in a great rage
and threatned this Deponent for
doing that wrong, and so they
passed along into the Fields and
loaded all the Three Carts, the
other two Carts returned safe
home, and back again, twice
loaded that day afterwards; but as
to this Cart which touched <font>Rose
Cullenders</font> House, after it was
loaded, it was overturned twice
or thrice that day; and after that
they had loaded it again the
second or third time, as they
brought it through the Gate
which leadeth out of the Field
into the Town, the Cart stuck so
fast in the Gates-head, that they
could not possibly get it through,
but were inforced to cut down
<pagebreak id="50" />
the Post of the Gate to make the
Cart pass through, although they
could not perceive that the Cart
did of either side touch the 
Gateposts. And this Deponent 
further saith, That after they had
got it through the Gate-way,
they did with much difficulty get
it home into the Yard; but for 
all that they could do, they could
not get the Cart near unto the 
place where they should unload
the Corn, but were fain to unload
it at a great distance from the
place, and when they began to
unload they found much
difficulty therein, it being so hard a
labour that they were tired that
first came; and when others
came to assist them, their Noses
burst forth a bleeding: so they
were fain to desist and leave it
until the next Morning, and then
<pagebreak id="51" />
they  unloaded it without any 
difficulty at all.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Robert Sherringham</font> also
Deposeth against <font>Rose Cullender</font> ,
That about Two Years since,
passing along the Street with his
Cart and Horses, the Axletree of
his Cart touched her House, and
broke down some part of it, at
which, she was very much
displeased, threatning him, that his
Horses should suffer for it; and
so it happen'd, for all those
Horses, being Four in Number, died
within a short time after: since
that time he hath had great Losses
by the suddain dying of his other
Cattle; so soon as his Sows 
pigged, the Pigs would leap and
caper, and immediately fall down
and dye. Also, not long after,
he was taken with a Lameness in
his Limbs that he could neither go
<pagebreak id="52" />
nor stand for some days. After
all this, he was very much vexed
with great Number of Lice of an
extraordinary bigness, and
although he many times shifted
himself, yet he was not any thing
the better, but would swarm
again with them; so that in the
Conclusion he was forc'd to burn
all his Clothes, being two suits
of Apparel, and then was clean
from them.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>As concerning <font>Amy Duny</font> , one
<font>Richard Spencer</font> Deposeth, That
about the first of <font>September</font> last,
he heard her say at his House,
<font>That the Devil would not let her rest
until she were Revenged on one</font>
Cornelius Sandeswell's <font>Wife</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ann Sandeswel</font> Wife unto the
above-said <font>Cornelius</font> , Deposed,
That about Seven or Eight Years
since, she having bought a certain
<pagebreak id="53" />
number of Geese, meeting with
<font>Amy Duny</font> , she told her, <font>If she
did not fetch her Geese home they
would all be Destroyed</font> : which in
a few days after came to pass.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Afterwards the said <font>Amy</font>
became Tenant to this Deponents
Husband for a House, who told
her, <font>That if she looked not well to
such a Chimney in her House, that
the same would fall</font> : Whereupon
this Deponent replyed, That it
was a new one; but not
minding much her Words, at that time
they parted. But in a short time
the Chimney fell down
according as the said <font>Amy</font> had said.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Also this Deponent farther
saith, That her Brother being a
Fisherman, and using to go into
the <font>Northern Seas</font> , she desired him
to send her a Firkin of Fish, which
he did accordingly; and she
<pagebreak id="54" />
having notice that the said Firkin
was brought into <font>Leystoff-Road</font> ,
she desired a Boatman to bring
it ashore with the other Goods
they were to bring; and she
going down to meet the Boat-man
to receive her Fish, desired the
said <font>Amy</font> to go along with her to
help her home with it; <font>Amy</font>
Replyed, <font>She would go when she had
it</font> . And thereupon this
Deponent went to the Shoar without
her, and demanded of the
Boatman the Firkin, they told her,
That they could not keep it in
the Boat from falling into the
Sea, and they thought it was gone
to the Divel, for they never saw
the like before. And being
demanded by this Deponent, 
whether any other Goods in the Boat
were likewise lost as well as hers?
They answered,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Not any</font> .
<pagebreak id="55" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>This was the substance of the 
whole Evidence given against the 
Prisoners at the Bar; who being 
demanded, what they had to say
for themselves? They replyed,
<font>Nothing material to any thing that
was proved against them</font> .
Whereupon, the Judge in giving his 
direction to the Jury, told them,
That he would not repeat the
Evidence unto them, least by so
doing he should wrong the
Evidence on the one side or on the 
other. Only this acquainted them,
That they had Two things to
enquire after. <font>First</font> , Whether or
no these Children were 
Bewitched? <font>Secondly</font> , Whether the
Prisoners at the Bar were Guilty of
it?</nonSpeech>
