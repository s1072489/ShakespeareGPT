   <nonSpeech>Cryer.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Hardresse Waller</font> Knight, <font>hold up thy hand, what  
sayest
thou, art thou guilty of this horrid Act of Treason whereof thou
standest indicted, or not guilty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hard. Wall.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I cannot say, I am not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Then you plead, you are guilty.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hard.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes my Lord, I am guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Set him aside.</font>
Thomas Harison, <font>Hold up thy hand, art thou guilty or not guilty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If I should say I am not guilty, I should wrong my 
own
conscience, yet in matter and form as it is laid down in this
Indictment, I am not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you plead not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire I may have counsell afforded me, 
and
time to make my defence, for I have been kept close prisoner in a
dark Chamber, and had no notice of my Tryal till five of the clock
in the morning, that I am altogether unprepared.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>You are to plead guilty or not guilty, for in cases  
of
Treason Counsel is not to be assigned, for that would make it
justifiable, and that it were not Treason, and you would be quit,    
but if
it be treason, then it is not justifiable.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>How wilt thou be tryed.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By the Lords Lawes, and by the good and wholesome
Laws of the Land.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Wilt thou be tryed by God and the Countrey.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Har.</font> He answered that was a profane word.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Then the Judge answered</font> ,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>he shall be turned over to   
God and the
Countrey.</font> 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Har.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>No Sir, I will be tryed by God and the Country.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God send thee a good deliverance, </dialogue><nonSpeech>and turn'd    
him aside.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Henry Heveningham, <font>hold up thy hand, guilty or not guilty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hev.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>How wilt thou be tryed.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Hev.</nonSpeech><dialogue> I will present an humble Petition to His Majesty and the
Parliament, and desire your Lordships to let me return to my
lodgings in the Tower, for I have some infirmities upon me.
<pagebreak id="5" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>We can give you no answer to that,</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> How wilt thou be tryed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Hev.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>By God and the Countrey.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God send thee a good deliverance.
<font>Set them by, Bring</font> Isaac Pennington, Henry Martin, Gilbert
Millington, Robert Tichborn, and Robert Lilborn <font>to the Bar</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Henry Martin, <font>Hold up thy hand to the Bar, what 
sayest
thou, art guilty of this horrid act of Treason whereof thou standest 
indicted or not guilty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I desire the benefit of the Act of        
Indempnity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>First you are to plead before you can have the       
benefit of
any thing, and for your pleading the Act of Indemnity that makes
you guilty.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, If I plead, I loose the benefit of that   
Act.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Your name is in that Act.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My name is not there my Lord, my name is <font>Henry 
Marten</font> , not <font>Martin</font> , </dialogue><nonSpeech>Then the Judge said</nonSpeech><dialogue> there is no      
difference
between <font>Martin</font> and <font>Marten</font> in Law, the difference is very     
little in
the sound, </dialogue><nonSpeech>then said the Clerk,</nonSpeech><dialogue> art thou guilty or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>The Judge bid him</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>be advised, for it makes no         
difference if there
were two names of the like form, the difference is betwixt the six
Names, and 'twill but make you a Mute in Law, and a Mute in
Treason, Sir, you must have Judgement passed on you</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you guilty or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mar.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I desire Counsel my Lord in that which is matter of    
Law.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What do you desire counsel for? you are indicted  
for
matter of Treason, for Contriving and Composing the Kings
death: you have justification to plead if it be Treason, it is not
justifiable; or if it be justifiable, it is not Treason.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Then my Lord I plead not guilty.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How will you be tryed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mar.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>By God and the Countrey.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God send thee a good deliverance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>You may give any Evidence, but in a case of this     
nature
you can give no Evidence.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Gilbert Millingtoun</font> , Hold up thy hand, what  
sayst thou
<pagebreak id="6" />
art guilty of this horrid Act of Treason or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mil.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I humbly crave your Lordships pardon in some few       
words.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Judg.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir we must do in this case as in all other       
cases, either
you must plead guilty or not, if you plead not guilty, you shall be
heard hereafter: but you must plead guilty or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mil.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>There is something in that Indictment which I am not    
guilty of.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Jud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then plead not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mil.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I am not guilty my Lord.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How wilt thou be tryed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>M.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>By God and my Countrey.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God send thee a good deliverance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Robert Tichborn, <font>hold up thy hand, art thou guilty of
this horrid Act of Treason, or not guilty</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tich.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have for some space been kept close    
prisoner,
and I am altogether unable in the Law to speak for my self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Jud.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>You must plead guilty, or not guilty.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tich.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Spare me one word, if the Tryal be matter of Law, 
give
leave for Counsel to plead for me: if I should plead my own case
in Law, I might be overpowred, since there are many persons of
great eminency and honour will plead against me, but I will not
trouble you long if this be the case in matter and form as I am
here Indicted, I am not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>How wilt thou be tryed?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Tich.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <comment type="compiler">NO SPEAKER NAME GIVEN IN SOURCE TEXT.</comment> By God  
and the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>God send you a good deliverance.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Owen Roe, Hold up your hand, art thou guilty of    
this
horrid act of Treason or not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Owen Roe,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>My Lord, I will rest upon the Judgement of the
Court, in matter and form as I stand indicted, I am not guilty.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How wilt thou be try'd?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Owen Roe,</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>By God and the Country.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> God send thee a good deliverance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Robert Lilburn, <font>Hold up thy hand, art thou guilty or  
not 
guilty</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lilburn,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been close Prisoner my Lord these twenty 
dayes, and none suffered to come to me, and I am told that I
ought to have counsel before I plead.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>You are misinformed, you cannot have it, you must     
plead
guilty or not guilty, for if this be your argument, and this answer
return of Iudgement will be given against you, for the rule is set
before us.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lilborn,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, if you over rule me, I cannot help it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Judg.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sir, Pray let no such words fall from your mouth.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Lilborn,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I must say in matter and form as I    
stand
indicted, I am not guilty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>How wilt thou be try'd?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L.</nonSpeech><dialogue> By God and the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>God send thee a good deliverance.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Cler.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Call <font>Adrian Scroop, Augustine Garland, Gregory Clement,
Peter Temple, John Jones, Iames Temple, Iohn Cook, Iohn Carew</font> ,
</dialogue><nonSpeech>all which held up their hands as others before by degrees, 
pleading not guilty?</nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech>Afterwards was called <font>Tho. Scot, Henry Smith, Gregory Clement,
Vincent Potter, Edmund Harvy, Tho. Wait, Hugh Peters</font> , to hold up 
their hands and read the Charge,</nonSpeech><dialogue> are ye guilty or not guilty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pet.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>I cannot say I am guilty my Lord, for I would not be   
guilty
of the murder for ten thousand Worlds.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cler.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How wilt thou be tryed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Pet.</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>By the word of God</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech>at which the Court smiled.</nonSpeech>
