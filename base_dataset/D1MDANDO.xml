<nonSpeech> <font>Bankes</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Holla Marocco, whose mare is
dead, that you are thus 
melancoly, vp I saie, and let you and
me conferre a little vppon the
cause, wherby matters &amp; 
dealings may seeme to be so, you
know my meaning.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whereby matters and dealinges may seeme
for to be. Verie good sir, spoke like a wholesome 
haberdasher, and as wisely by Lady master, as he that was
sworne to his <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: hls</comment> wiues friends, not to credit out  
his wares
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
to anie man for the first fifteene yeeres hee was 
married.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And therewith mee thinkes I see him hang
the hat vpon the pin againe. Wast not so Marocco? I
am glad sir to heare you so pleasant in the threshold of
my discourse, for I am come in purpose to debate a
while and dialogue with you, and therefore haue at
you after your watering. Laie out your lips and sweep
your manger cleane, and summon your wits together,
for I meane (by mine host leaue) to recreate my selfe 
awhile with your horsemanship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I am as like master to shew you some
horse plaie as ere a nag in this parish, for tis a iade can
neither whihie nor wag his taile, &amp; you haue brought
me vp to both I thanke you, and made me an 
vnderstanding horse, and a horse of seruice, master, and that
you know.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Marocco I know it and acknowledge it, &amp;
so must thou if thou haue so much ingenuitie, confesse
my kindnes, thou art not onely but also bound to 
honest Bankes, for teaching thee so many odde prankes. I
haue brought thee vp right te~derly, as a Bakers 
daughter would bring vp a Cosset by hand, &amp; allow it bread
and milke by the eie.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font> <foreign>Maius peccatum habes</foreign> </font> , master you haue 
the
more to answere, God helpe you. For I warrant you,
(though I saie it that should not saie it) I eat more 
prouender in foure and twentie houres, than two of the
best geldings that Robin Snibor keeps, that a hires for
two shillings a daie a peece.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bank.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two shillings Marocco, nay what saist thou by
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
halfe a crowne, and ten groats.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marie I say, three daies hire is worth foure 
such horses, saddles, and all. For a buyes them for
ten pence a saddle at S. Giles one with another,
and those accoutrements are sutable to his steeds.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Me thinkes such steedes should stand a
man in small stead, by that he had ridde some fiue
miles out of towne.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea bee sure, or halfe fiue miles either.
And commonly the saddle fals asunder and splits
in two peeces at the towns end, and one side takes
his iourney towards Vxbridge, and the other 
towards Stanes, to stop mine Hosts cushions of the
George.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why thats <font> <foreign>Suum cuique</foreign> </font> boye, for the
waine-men of the West countrie, and the 
Carryers of Gloucester shire commonlye barter awaye
their broken ware with the hostlers for pease and
horsebread, and they returne them a horsebacke
to Peter Pympe the patchpannell. Marocco thou
knowest where I am now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not I truely master, vnlesse you meane
that shrewde Sadler that serued you so ill the last
Tearme, and as I trowe his name was not Peter,
his name was Iohn Indifferent, for a wrought me
thought as if a had not cared whether a had 
earned your money or no.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Beshrew him Marocco, a deceiued my
hope, in a good part of purple veluet hose, that I
purposde should haue made mee a seemely 
saddle.
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Maister you are to purpose, and he to
dispose, of those hose then were your breeches in
his hands, and sweetely he handled them as you
know: here mee thinkes had you supde vp but a
quarter of sack, a quart of sacke, I should haue said.
See how my minde was Master Patinis vpon the
bagge of Otes &amp;c. Or had you come in but 
reasonably loded from the Tauerne, or taken some of
the excellent Muscadine at the Horne: why,
what an occupation might you apprehend to
rayle horribly against these mechanicall fellowes
of the Towne, that so they haue it, care not howe
they come by it. Twas but a veneriall sinne in this
Sadler, to nycoll you, or nicke you rather of an
old peece of Veluet hose. But what thinke you by
him that had the conscience to aske fourteene
yeardes of Satten for a sute of Apparell, and not
to put in nine of them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bancks.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea Marocco, as well as of him that sold it
for eighteene shillings a yearde, being not worth
ten.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O he gaue time Master: And then take heed
of that while you liue, In space, growes grace And
in prosperitie of the Satten, will swell 
wonderfully.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Banckes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am fall as fast in a cunning stealers
hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A hard harte hath hee that hath such a
hande to cut such large thonges of another
mans lether, and lappe him selfe in a gentle mans
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
liuery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Banckes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush, this is but a pettye matter to
stande vpon: And yet Marocco I dare saie it and
sweare it to thee, because thou art no talker:
this petty matter hath pyncht neerer than
euery man weenes for. I am vndone, nowe
young gentleman <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: genleman</comment> . Well, <font> <foreign>Motos

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why maister of whome should you bee
afraide, I am able to iustifye as much as you
say. Indeed those be the young men that neuer
sawe the Lyons. Young maisters and 
gentlemen of the carelesse cut, such as care not howe
they bee cut, or of what cut they bee like, so they
may haue, to follow al fashions, and then they are
cut indeed, no force <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: noforce</comment> , so they fall into a 
fashion, and walke but twentie foure turnes in
Paules, let it packe the next daye for the third
peny. Maister M. <font> <foreign>Nemo ceditur nisi a seipso</foreign> </font> . Byrch
and greene holly, and thou be beaten boy, thank
thine owne follie: He that will thrust his necke
into the yoke, is worthy to be vsed like a iade. He
that hath been a gentleman of faire demeanes,
and will so demeane him selfe to let landes
and lordeshippes flie for a little brauery 
<font> <foreign>Luat paenas &amp; in pistrino</foreign> </font> , let him crye and let him lye,
yea and dye to, for any pittie hee is like to haue
at my handes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ba.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why how now Marocco. O ye are too sowre.
Dare <comment type="compiler">CATCHWORDS ARE Dare you BUT Dare IS NOT REPEATED ON 
FOLLOWING PAGE</comment>
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
you tell mee of my splene agaynst the Sadler, and
bee so bitter against the young gallantes of our
age. What man, nay horse rather, nay asse as thou
art, to become odious to the flower of Englande
with thy foule manners. It is as naturall for young
men to be braue and amorous, as for olde men to
be graue and serious. Why colte then, youle take
vppon you I see? Doo you not heare what they
saie that scarse vouchsafe you an answere? <font> <foreign>Patres
aequum esse censent nos iam iam a pueris illico nasci
senes, neque illarum affines esse rerum, quas fert 
adolescentia</foreign> </font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Maister you mistake me, I am no such
seuere horse nor sullen asse, but I can allowe a yong
Gentleman his madde trickes, yea, and his merrie
trickes too for a need. But master, this Latine I
learned when I gambolde at Oxforde, <font> <foreign>Est modus
in rebus sunt, certi denique fines</foreign> </font> . This is it vrgeth me
thus farre, and I speake it in passion too, and wyth
the action of my head and heeles, that a
Mercadore, naye, a mechanicall fellowe shall go so farre
into a Gentleman, and a Gentleman so farre out
of himselfe &amp; all a has, that for one or two tearmes
arraie, a shall for his liues tearme, and tearme of
life become beggeries bondman, and vsuries 
vassall, <font> <foreign>O tempora, O mores, O Poetarum flores</foreign> </font> . You shall
finde in an olde Tracte printed by Winkin de
Woorde, this olde sayde sawe, Whats a
Gentleman but his pleasure, O pleasure, what a treasure
is it to take pleasure with measure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Measure Marocco, nay, nay, they that
<pagebreak id="B4R" />
take vp commodities make no difference <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: differnce</comment> for
measure betweene a Flemishe ell and an Englishe
yard.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I knowe an ell Flemish cost English
Anthonie halfe a yard of the best ware he had.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That ware will neuer see ware againe,
in so good sorte as it hath done, nor sit in a 
shower of raine on the top of Amwell hill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Go to master, hum drum is sauce for a
cunnie, you and I should doo verie ill to speake in
priuate, we are so plaine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Plaine Marocco, nay and I were as
plaine as I will bee, I should crie out-right, for in
this I agree with thee, and with thee the world
agrees, and besides teares and commiseration on
the state of Gentlemen that haue vngentlefied,
why I might saie, dishonored themselues by
buying and selling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Haue they so master? Why woulde hee
bee a buyer then? Why woulde hee bee a seller?
This buying and selling,
By all mens telling,
Is gaine without swelling,
To him that sels his dwelling,
For his bonds cancelling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ho, ho, good Marocco, I see now a
dozen of bread dooes as much with you, as three
pipes of Tobacco taken in an odde alehouse, to a
weake braine.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am not dronke master, after my
watering, that you need to challenge mee thus: I know
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
what I saie, and I saie what I knowe:
To buy this measure,
And this momentanie pleasure,
With so much treasure,
To sell seate and seizure,
And repent at leasure.
   Go to master, he is a bad waster, that consumes
his daies and houres, and reapes <foreign>Pour vn plaisure,
<font>mille</font> </foreign> . Cambridge and Oxford can record: and the
foule dolorous fortune of many a faire boorde,
What it is?
What it is to come into the clouches,
For Aglets or brouches,
Of these pure appearing asses,
That like simple glasses
Seeme that they are not,
Let them storme I care not:
Vnpittied might he bee,
That imbases his degree,
With this indignitie.
   I tell you master, for a truth I tell you too, I
knowe a man that in this towne, had a Bible lying
on his shoppe boorde, and solde but three yardes
of satten vnto a Gentleman, and forswore 
himselfe at least three times in the coping, and yet the
booke laie open before him, and hee came newe
from reading of Salomons Prouerbes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That had beene somwhat grosse in him
if he had beene reading the twentith of Exodus.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, his minde was on the twentith
daie of the moneth following, when his money
<pagebreak id="C1R" />
was due.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis good to haue an eie to the maine:
house keeping is chargeable, and rent must bee
paide, the Landlord will haue his due, <font> <foreign>Caueat 
emptor</foreign> </font> , let the Tenant looke to it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Landlord will leade to the deuill, &amp;
the Tenant will follow after.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bancks.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What else? they be relatiues: Landlord
and Tenant are as <font> <foreign>Pater</foreign> </font> and <font> <foreign>Filius</foreign> </font> .   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O master, I could relate to you of these
relatiues, if it became me to speake like a 
commonwealths man, what an abuse is ingendered twixte
the Landlord and Tenant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Occasion of what Marocco.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Of more amisse by gis, than easily amended
is, of bauderie, and beggerie, and such lyke
matters, master. <font> <foreign>Ambubaiarum collegia, 
pharmacapolae, mendici mimi balatrones, hoc genus omne.</foreign> </font> Crie
out and complaine for the loffe of this good 
landlordes worship, God rest his soule, sayes T. B. wee
could haue had no wrong while hee liued: so hee
had had his rent at the daie, the deuill and Iohn
of Comber shoulde not haue fetcht Kate L. to
Bridewell, no nor all the Court whipt C. F. at the
cart, Ile tell you master, come what complaint
coulde haue come against Peticoate lane, Smocke
Alley, Shordich, or Rotten rowe, there were
champions and spokes men for this crue, other
manner of felowes I wis, than you thinke for, such
as sit in their sattens and riche furres, and wyth a
<pagebreak id="C1V" />
dash of a penne in a counting house, coulde doo
more than the proudest plaintiefe that 
commenceth anie matter or sute against this sisterhoode,
yea, and seale vp his letter and theyr lyps both at
once, that murmure anie thing against the 
inhabitantes of this holy corner. Master I coulde haue
shewed you the coppie of a Letter that was lost in
this yarde by chaunce, written by a man of some
account, so fauourably to the Treasurer of 
Bridewell, in the behalfe of an honest Tenaunt of his,
such a Tenant, master, as had her name <font> <foreign>a Tenendo</foreign> </font> ,
and would holde so fast betweene the thighs, that
shame it was for him that had anie shame, to be so
shamelesse to vse anie meanes to keep her from 
open shame.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thou speakest of mallice against some
or other Marocco, and perhappes thou meanest
that drabbe that the last daie when shee sawe thee
heere doo thy trickes, sayd thou wert a deuill &amp; I
a coniurer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Against her Master, no of mine honestie,
she is but a poore whoore, to her I meane. Tush,
she that I talke of can entertaine you with a duzen
of tiffite taffetie girles in a morning, I, and the
worst of them, when she is at the worst, shall haue
a wrought wastcoate on her backe, and a lockram
smocke worth three pence, as well rent behind as
before, I warrant you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ban.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Those rents by your leaue Marocco, helpe
to paie the Landlords rent at the quarters end.
<pagebreak id="C2R" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I master, and the Landlorde by your
leaue helpes to rent some of them betweene the
quarters.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thats but a tricke of youth lad, <font> <foreign>Omnis
homo mendax</foreign> </font> , Euerie man may amend.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True master, <font> <foreign>Et vt hora sic vita</foreign> </font> , A   
loues a
whoore as his lyfe. For hee will forbeare as long
as shee will beare, and thats ka mee, and ka thee,
knaue he, and queane she.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had neede bee of exceeding patience
Marocco, to forbeare as long as sheele beare, for a
better bearing beast is not in all Shordich, nor
Hounds-dich neither, than this beastly beast that
I thinke thou meanest. But speake not so loude,
for and if her landlord heard you, hee would aunswere
for her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke so, has answered so long for her,
that a can scarce answere for himselfe, and I speake
not so loude that I feare him, <font> <foreign>Male audit vbique</foreign> </font> ,
master, a heares verie badlye euerie where: and
worse a will heare, and a holde on, yea master, and
loose hearing and seeing to, and a vie it and see it,
as a has done these duzen yeres.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, whats that to the purpose, these
wrongs are priuate, and touch himself, and wrack
not the common wealth, as thou exclaymest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O master, then you know nothing: for
vnderstand you as of Nownes, some be substantiues,
some be adiectiues: so of Landlords, some of them
bee couetous, and some bee lecherous, and hee
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
is both.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Banckes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sayest mee so. Well then Marocco,
whether does more harme in the commonwelth,
the couetous or the lecherous Landlord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tush master, that question is no question.
For though it bee a question betweene the 
couetous and the prodigall, yet is it no question 
betwixt the couetous and the lecherous. The 
lecherous Landlord hath his wench at his 
commandement, and is content to take ware for his money,
his priuate scutcherie wounds not the 
commonwealth farther than that his whoore shall haue a
house rent free, when his honest neighbours wife
and children shall neither haue a peece of a house
or a householde loafe for him. Let him passe for a
farting churle, and weare his mistres fauors, <foreign>viz.</foreign>
rubies and precious stones on his nose, &amp;c. And
this <font> <foreign>Et caetera</foreign> </font> shall, if you will, bee the perfectest
poxe that euer grewe in Shordich or 
Southwarke.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And there haue beene bigge 
inflamations, and more vnquenchable than the great fire
that burnt so much blew threed on the toppe of
Fishstreet hill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But the couetous Landlord is the 
caterpiller of the common-wealth, hee neither feares
God nor the deuill, nor so hee maye racke it out,
cares not what Tenant he receiues: he is no 
wencher (praie God he be no bencher) hee sits warme
at home, and sets downe his accounts, and saies to
<pagebreak id="C3R" />
himselfe, my houses goe nowe but for twentie
poundes by the yeere, Ile make them all baudie
houses, and they will yeeld mee twice as much.
Vppon the Exchange comes to him one or two
honest men to take the~ at his hands, the poore 
artificer or his lyke, of what trade so euer, offers him
the rent it hath gone for, &amp; sureties perhaps. Yea,
saie so, good securitie, and foure pounds a yere for
a house, comes Pierce Pandor, and baudie 
Bettrice his wife, two that I warrant you were 
knowen well inough what they were, I two that had
beene as well carted and whipt, and couerd with
durt ouer head and eares, and they forsooth will
begin the world anue again, hauing a fresh wench
or two that came but from the carryers that 
morning, though shee had tapt many a canne in long
lane at Barthelmew tide. With this stocke of 
wenches will this Trustie Roger and his Bettrice set
vp forsooth with their pamphlet pots, and stewed
prunes, nine for a tester, in a sinfull saucer, and
they will offer this couetous and wretched 
landlorde fiue poundes by the yeere, yea sixe pounds
to haue his house and his countenaunce wythall.
But hee that will go to the deuill for money, will
admit them with fauour, and so let them haue his
house, with promise of anie thing whatsoeuer in
his power, yea, and if occasion serue, will write,
and speak, and take paines and plaie the sutor, and
beare wyth them in anie thing, so there bee anie
meane to doo it, and hee to bee sure of his rent.
<pagebreak id="C3V" />
God is his iudge hee does it for no fleshly respect,
but euen of a mere worldly motion, to beare sinne
out with sinne, and lecherie with couetousnesse.
Let the Parish complaine, why (sayes hee) what
should I doo, I haue my rent paid mee at my day.
I must make money of my lande, and so let them
doo their heartes out, thinkes hee, I shall haue my
rent the readier. This cormorant is hee that cares
not how he get it so hee haue it. This Stymphalist
is he that with fiue or sixe Tenements, and the 
retinue thereunto belonging, infectes the aire with
stench, and poisons that parish, yea and twentie
parishes off with the contagion of such carrion as
lies there in their bumble baths, and stinke at both
ends like filthie greene elder pipes. For him and
them master, such Landlordes and such Tenants.
Good master wish as I wish.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bankes.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whats thy wish Marocco?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That at the quarter daie the parish would
of their owne deuotion to the common wealth,
bestow a banket vpon them of ale and cakes in the
cage, &amp; a hundred or two of good faggots, to 
consume the bodies and bones of them all and euerie
mothers child, such Landlords and such Tenants
as so much against conscience, receiue &amp; deceiue,
and daie by daie, and houre by houre cheat, 
coosen, catch, and deuour in pillage from gentlemen,
prentises, and good fellowes, <font> <foreign>ab vno vsque ad mille</foreign> </font> ,
euen from the outside to the inside, from the cloak
to the shirt, leauing Nicol Neuerthriue neuer a
<pagebreak id="C4R" />
wench in the chamber or penie in the purse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ban.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Marocco, Praie thy wish take effect, I wish
for euerie parish so pestered with such tenants and
tenements, God put into their mindes to be but at
cost and charges for the faggots, for ale and cakes
I were mearst, if it cost fiue markes. But how does
this landlord fall into this <font> <foreign>Praemunire</foreign> </font> ? Why is thy
mallice so great against them, when tis the baude
and the whoore that make all this stirre?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O master, miserable landlords are cause of
all this mischiefe. Tis he that because he will haue
an vnreasonable rent, will vpholde anie villanie in
his tenant: a slaue to monie, a pandor to the baud,
a piller, nay a pillow &amp; a bolster to all the roguerie
committed in his houses. And yet will this filthie
felow sit at his doore on a sonday in the high street
and my mistres his wife by him, &amp; there forsooth
talke so saint-like of the sermon that day, and what
a good peece of worke the young man made, and
what a goodly gift of vtterance he had, but not the
value of a pound of beefe wil a giue him, were his
gift of vtterance comparable to S. Augustines, or
Chrisostomes eloquence. Sweare a will and
forsweare vpon the workeday, as well as anie. And if
percase a sit in place of authoritie, O howe seuere
will he be in all his proceedings against a yong or
good fellow in anie trifling matter. Then a takes
vpon him not a little: Sir (sayes hee) what did you
in such an house? Wherefore came you 
thether? And laie the lawe and the Prophetes too,
<pagebreak id="C4V" />
and so rate a Gentleman well descended, meerely
priuiledged with a furd gowne and a nightcap:
when in deede his bringing vp hath beene in 
beggerie and slauerie illiberally, hauing spent his time
in conference with the water tankard at the 
Conduit, lying miserably, and for sparing of wood, 
loding his gowne sleeue with fuell from the 
haberdashers, and wearing his handes in a frostie 
morning by the fugitiue flames of a few wast papers, a
naturall enemie to all learning and liberalitie. O
master, such a churle as you and I sawe heere last
daie talke with two souldiers in the yard, and put
his hand in his pouch, &amp; gaue them nere a penny.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ban.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Didst thou see that Marocco? Well, there
be too many such as he, yet there is a choice 
number of sober citizens that haue golden mindes, and
golden purses withall.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hor:</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I know well master, and to them that
haue such golden mindes, I wish golden mines:
master, I protest to you I speake it not to flatter, but
in reproach of those money-mongers, those 
lease-mongers, those caniballs, that dishonour the citie
wherein they dwell, but vprightly I speake it, that
you may not think I raile vpon mallice against any
priuate man for anie priuate quarrell: There are
many that beautifie London for their good parts,
who being ciuily and well brought vp, are affable
to straungers, charitable to the poore, liberall to
schollers, and such as Citizens should be, dutifull
to their prince, and deuout to their citie.
<pagebreak id="D1R" />
But as cockle is euer among corne, and drosse 
among gold, so will those foule churles cumber the 
best corners, and march cheek by ioul among the
better many, with as great shew of deuotion and
charitie as the best. From such dissembling 
holynesse, such double wickednesse, good Lord
delyuer vs.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Banks.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Tis almost supper time Marocco, I heare
mine host call, you haue done pretily well for two
pointes, referre the rest till another time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Horse.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As you please master, and let this be our
first lecture of the Anatomie of the world. If the
Trance holde me but till the next Tearme, where
now I haue but with a drie foote ouerleapt these
matters, I may chance of these and more leaue a
deeper print, and hauing handled a case of 
commodities, will saie somewhat further of their 
discommodities and differences, euen as the bit of
reason shall leade mee. And so I commit you to
your supper, and my selfe to my litter, for I
promise you I am not a little weary
with gambolling this
afternoone.
