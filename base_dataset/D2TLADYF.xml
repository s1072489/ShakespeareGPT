   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. S.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, the Reason why you be
call'd hither this day, is to sit as Peers of <font>Frances</font>
Countess of <font>Somerset</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Fenshaw,</font> <font>Clerk of the Crown</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Frances</font>
Countess of <font>Somerset</font> , hold up thy Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>She does so, and held it up till Mr. Lieutenant
told her she might put it down; and then he read
the Indictment, containing <font>Weston's</font> Accounts, in
the poisoning of Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> , and her
abetting of him, the 8th of <font>May</font> 1613.
   The Countess of <font>Somerset</font> , all the while the
Indictment was reading, stood, looking pale,
trembled, and shed some few Tears; and at the first
naming of <font>Weston</font> in the Indictment, put her Fan
before her Face, and there held it half cover'd till
the Indictment was read.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mr. <font>Fenshaw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Frances</font> Countess of <font>Somerset</font> , what
sayst thou? Art thou guilty of this Felony and
Murder, or not guilty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>The Lady <font>Somerset</font> making an Obeisance to the
Lord High Steward, answer'd</nonSpeech><dialogue> Guilty, </dialogue><nonSpeech>with a low
Voice, but wonderful fearful.
   My Lady, upon her Arraignment, having
pleaded Guilty, the Proceeding after was thus:</nonSpeech><dialogue>

<pagebreak id="333C2" />
<comment type="compiler">ATTORNEY REFERS TO THE KING'S INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE CASE.</comment>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There be other Directions in these
Instructions, by way of Interrogatories, that are
not now necessary to be read.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. S.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let the Lords the Peers view these 
Directions from the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Coke.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> None of these Interrogatories which
the King desired there should be Examinations
upon, came away empty; and whatsoever
Whisperings there be abroad of the Death of <font>Weston</font> ,
they all (some before the hour of their Death)
confess'd the Fact, and died penitent; and if need
should require, I have brought their Confessor
along, (namely, Dr. <font>Whyting</font> .)
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. H. S.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lords, you see, and have heard those
Directions under the King's Hand; give the Glory
to God, and Honour to the King.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> May it please your Grace, <font>&amp;c.</font>
whereas <font>Frances</font> Countess of <font>Somerset</font> hath been
indicted as Accessary before the Fact, of the
wilful Poisoning and Murder of Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> ;
upon her Indictment, she hath been arraign'd;
upon her Arraignment, pleaded guilty: I desire that
her Confession may be recorded, and Judgment
given against the Prisoner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Fenshaw.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Frances</font> Countess of <font>Somerset</font> , hold up
thine Hand: Whereas thou hast been indicted,
arraign'd, and pleaded guilty, as Accessary before
the Fact, of the wilful Poisoning and Murder of
Sir <font>Thomas Overbury</font> ; what canst thou now say for
thy self, why Judgment of Death should not be
pronounced against thee?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>C. of Som.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can much aggravate, but nothing
extenuate my Fault; I desire Mercy, and that the
Lords will intercede for me to the King. </dialogue><nonSpeech> (This she
spake humbly, fearfully, and so low, the Lord
Steward could not hear it, but Mr. Attorney
related it.) </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mr. Attorney.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Lady is so touch'd with
Remorse and Sense of her Fault, that Grief surprizes
her from expressing of her self; but that which she
<pagebreak id="334C1" />
hath confusedly said, is to this effect, That she
cannot excuse herself, but desires Mercy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Richard Conningsby</font> sitting before the Lord
High Steward, rises, and upon his Knee delivers
him the White Staff.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. H. S.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Frances</font> Countess of <font>Somerset</font> , whereas
thou hast been indicted, arraigned, pleaded guilty,
and that thou hast nothing to say for thy self, it is
now my part to pronounce Judgment; only thus
much before, Since my Lords have heard with
<pagebreak id="334C2" />
what Humility and Grief you have confessed the
Fact, I do not doubt they will signify so much to
the King, and mediate for his Grace towards you:
but in the mean time, according to the Law, the
Sentence must be this, That thou shalt be carried
from hence to the Tower of <font>London</font> , and from
thence to the place of Execution, where you are
to be hang'd by the Neck till you be dead; and
the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.
