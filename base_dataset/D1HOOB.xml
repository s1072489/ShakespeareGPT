 <head>THE DISPLAY OF
FOLLIE.</head> 
   <nonSpeech> <font>Huddle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> See you neighbour <font>Dunstable</font> what hote
spurring there is made after the Buck ouer yonder
land? were it with you and me as it hath bene
since each knew other, we could not behold
such sport thus farre of, but rather so farre as
might become vs, keep way with the formost.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunstable.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir then was then, and now is now, they that 
cannot 
do as they haue done, must content themselues with what they
may do: pleaseth it you therefore to giue ouer the game in the
plaine fielde, and let me tie vp our horses to yonder bough,
reposing our selues awhile vnder the shade of this goodly
greene Oake. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I readily consent to your indifferent
motion. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because it is vnwholsome and not altogether 
safe
to sleepe in this wilde wood, let me beseech you to discourse
such matters as our experience may delight vs to remember:
withall, voutchsafe I pray you, to report the newes of London,
for thence I vnderstand your maistership is lately come.             
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
With a glad will, but ere we enter into them, let me first tell 
you what I latest heard, which proouing true will equally glad 
vs both. This noble Earle is not come hither to take an
honorable recreation only, as heretofore he was wont, but purposeth
withall to keepe a standing house here the whole yeare
thorough. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But that I feare the contrarie, how       
should I
reioyce these glad tidings. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My selfe in like manner   
hold
the matter doubtfull, knowing the speciall imploiments her
Maiestie hath daily to make of his most approoued good
seruices, being full as he hath bene alwaies so excellent a
becomming states peare, that his worthinesse cannot but carrie him
from vs to matters of farre greater consequence. To say truly,
<pagebreak id="A4V" />
our vntoward deseruings haue merited no such benefit from
him for longer then we are receiuing good turnes at his hands,
<omission type="sentence" /> <comment type="compiler">THE REST OF HUDDLE'S SPEECH OMITTED: THE EARL IS NOT AS 
APPRECIATED AS HE SHOULD BE.</comment>
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Since it is your
pleasure to stay your discourse with a desire to heare my plaine
eloquence, I rather blame you for speaking too little against
that which is so worthy reproofe, then otherwise thinke much
or that you ouer said in the Earle his praise. To say truly, such
are our grosse manners, not caring what we say so we say
somwhat, and somwhat we must say, else could not the world take
knowledge of our sufficiencies, which serue vs much better to
finde wants in other men, where they are not, then to feele the
burthen of our owne extremities, lying heauy vpon our
<pagebreak id="B1R" />
shoulders ready to breake our weake backs. For my part, I meane to
turne that cursed speaking you named into hartie praier, that it
may please God to further this noble man his purpose and
desire, both to this whole countries benefit, and also to the
encoraging of other noble and worshipfull Gentlemen, who
accompanie him in loue and good will, to do the like by his
example, where they dwell. A thing so much discontinued and so
farre worne out of fashion, that vnlesse by some notable man
it be reduced and set vp againe, the old ancient patterns lost and
gone, I feare me, it will hardly or neuer catch the right shape
againe, men haue swarued so much to the new cut, wearing all
on London fashion, where they neuer thinke on their poore
countries, saue on quarter rent daies only. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Though you 
spared me on the maine which stood in your way, you thought 
to nick me on the bye, not set for you. <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">THE REST OF HUDDLE'S SPEECH OMITTED: DRESS HAS IMPROVED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="B1V" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Surely you fauour me rightly; for it was my      
meaning to 
shew the dislike I had of such as weare more on their backs in 
<pagebreak id="B2R" />
one day, then their fathers did in their whole life time.            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Now I dare vndertake by your waightie words, you meane 
such as weare more armour on their backs in one day, or are
girte with more wounds and stripes then their Fathers were.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay rather, I speake against that excesse, where
commendable Farmes which were wont to maintain &amp; bring vp honest
tennants and their children, ouer and aboue the rent, are dasht
vpon one sute of apparrell together with one daies
vnmeasurable expences.
<comment type="compiler">HUDDLES'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="B2V" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Through your gentle teachings, I
begin to perceaue an approoued error, in ouerdoing, as well in
things that haue good purposes and intents, as also in
matters grounded vppon mischiefs, carrying an outward shew of
holy and religious deeds. I confesse, Monasteries and Priories
were not so likely to haue bin causes hereof, as the other
<pagebreak id="B3R" />
dissolute houses, where refreshings were without respect or
partiality. The Moncks and Abbots of my knowledge, cut large
shiuers of the loafe for which they neuer sweate, to make them
selues strong in the peoples fauour and opinion, or else spent
their whole gettings vpon vnlawfull children. Yet 
notwithstanding by your fauour, you haue not attained vnto the
full of my meaning and desire herein. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confesse I haue
not, for the sight of beefed beggers that thronged so thick in
my way: but now I haue got past them, I will go neare to meet
you on your owne bawlke. Your desire is to haue houses kept
to beare the Lord of misrule company at Christmas, spending
then vpon Hick and Stephan, who haue no need of it, what
would maintaine a seemly family more then halfe a yeare. Such
may well be called the Lord of misrule his guests, who besides
excessiue ouer-eating &amp; drinking the~selues, spoiling by misuse
that they cannot deuour, leaue behind them also such
vnmannerly annoyances, called bestialities, that the Nobleman and
Gentleman that hath thus crammed his quoistrels, must of
necessitie forsake their house and housekeeping, till a good winde
blow away the vnpleasant sauours their Christmasse Poulcats
leaue behind them. Thus besides excessiue cost and trouble by
the fruits of this carelesse hospitalitie, their houses are left in
worse case then common Innes or ostelries. If it be a
sheep-shearing feast, maister Baily can entertaine you with his bill 
of
reckonings to his Maister, of three sheapheards wages, spent on
fresh cates, besides spices and Saffron pottage. So that the
Nobleman &amp; Gentleman should haue nothing come in clearly to
them at any season, if your ancient patterns might be rightly
obserued. I know your meaning is not to haue the Hockedame
waited on by them, who for the most part let their lands to
halfes, or else conuert all into rent. The entertainment one of
them giues vnto another cannot be that you call so hotly
vpon: for those fashions you haue a homely terme I list not to
remember you of. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The money your maistership hath    
spent
in learning and trauell, is euery penny better bestowed then
other. Now I plainly see, let an ignorant man be neuer so wise, or
of neuer so great experience, but if he meete with a man of
<pagebreak id="B3V" />
gifts and bringing vp, his presuming to know all things
prooueth plaine ignorance, and meere mistaking. Once to day I
tooke my selfe to know as many wayes to the Church as
maister Vicar himselfe, but now I see Plowmen are no preachers.
I haue a Sonne that hath cost me many a quarter of corne, on
whome for this dayes worke I will bestowe one Peck of pure
graine, which toucht no chaffe this many a day, to buie him
more learning; and though I am not able to breed a
Gentleman, I may perhaps, as well as some of my neighbors, bring vp
one. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I meruaile how you stumble on the Church and the
Minister: this hote weather and our long talke should rather
haue put you in minde of the Butler and the Butterie. Besides
I cannot bethinke me what vertue should be in your peck of
pelfe, especially to alter nature; my selfe withall the proofe I
could make, could neuer finde the skill to cause a barking
mongrell to become a true questing Spaniel. To be plaine with
you, I neuer thinke an Ape more deformed, then when he
striueth by borrowed skill, to put on that which nature cannot
grace: nay rather those things are most vgly, which are forced
and done in spight of nature. Euery one to whome Mastership
belongeth is not a Gentleman, what purchase soeuer his father
maketh, vnlesse he can procure bloud to alter kinde: that you
cannot giue your sonne, because you haue not attained vnto it
your selfe. The notabilitie hereof proceeds from chiualrie and
marshall prowesse, where for princes right, and
commonweales saftie, through worthy aduentures of bloud and life,
purchase is made at the dearest price and rate. Therefore as
there cannot be a greater cause amongst men, then the Prince
and commonwealths businesse, nor a greater matter then bloud
and life, to be powred out and parted withall, of necessitie the
greatest and principallest respect and regard hath euer bene 
had therevnto. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By your fauour sir, there are no such
lawes yet made to prooue Souldiers Gentlemen: or if there be,
it is left out of their stile in all that I can reade or vnderstand  
of
their profession. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If you speake ignorantly, I am
contented to helpe you ouer the stile, you seeme not able to clime,  
but
if you play the Foxe with me, grapes are no meate for you, <omission type="sentence" />

<comment type="compiler">THE REST OF HUDDLE'S SPEECH OMITTED: DIVERSE DEGREES OF VIRTUE.</comment>
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Without offending you with my rude
answers, let me aske you this mannerly question. Do you meane
those that are begotten and borne in a Campe, to be onely
Gentlemen of bloud, or how otherwise I beseech you to shew me?
I haue heard this matter often debated, but neuer fully agreed
vpon. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because you haue alreadie heard it doubtfully
handled, and at no time discust, it may in like sort become me
to giue place to some doctor of the Ciuill law, to whose
profession it especially appertaineth to know the certaintie of all
worthie antiquities. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It fits me not to importune you,
otherwise I should receiue a great good turne at your
masterships hands thereby, for my sonne takes great delight in
petegrees of Gentlemen, and hath some skill in quartering their
coates. God willing he shall one day waight vpon you to
better his knowledges, if it may please you to accept of his
<pagebreak id="B4V" />
vnworthinesse. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bring him with you on Sonday next to   
dinner,
where you shal be sure of a Pigge for your sonne his welcome,
therein I meane to proue his skill, how he can head and
shoulder the same, the iawes and eares he shall bestow vpon you after
he hath quartered them. The head so spoiled, he shall charge his
quadrate trencher with. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought I should make you
merry with my mistakings, I now and then catch a word or
two from my sonne, which for lack of due placing, marreth all
in the making. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You shall in earnest (if you list to   
carry it
with you) heare what I can do in your sonne his Art. The Pigs
head shall be vpon a Spit couchant, the toung pendant, the
braines dormant in the sauce poinant. Now for a supporter or
crest, because of the quadrufoile in his bare head, there shall be
a recompence made by purchase of the back ribbes and
chinebone. All these thus put together, must of necessitie conclude
somwhat, especially in a morning fasting. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most of these
termes my sonne hath by heart, and will talke them to a glasse
window I haue, when many times it is my fortune to
ouerheare him. According to your saying also he hath often confest
vnto me, that his wit and memorie haue serued him best to
those purposes in a morning eare he haue eaten any thing. But
still I am to put you in minde of my former desire, wherein I
am perswaded you are able to satisfie a much better man then
my selfe. <omission type="line" />

<pagebreak id="C2R" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Surely Sir, you haue spoken so darkely, that for the thick 
spleigh of boughes and broad leaues of this tree, I cannot
discerne your meaning. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huddle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Thinke you I go about to
deceiue you with darkenesse of words? If a field be said to
haue eyes, a wood may likewise haue eares. But whether you
heare me not, or list not to beleeue me, the likelihood hereof
shall carrie me to credit the same, knowing that matters of
lesse proofe and more vnlikely trueth, haue bene receiued
from worse grounds and beginnings then this commeth
from. But you may see how the loue I beare you hath carried
me to clime vnknowne hauntes, and such difficult pathes, as
there are no steppes or traces left mee to follow; therefore
you may say, it is like to proue a hard iourney to a weake
traueller. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now I better remember my selfe, I haue   
read
many stories agreeing with your worthies in their notable
deedes and exploites, done by couragious and bold attempts.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huddle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not seeke to winne you by extremitie of
speeches, but leaue you to the libertie of your owne better
conceauings. To keepe whole the vnderstanding of the matter,
I will come to that which shall neereliest agree with that I said
before. After this principall Worthie was enthronized by
others, himselfe was also addicted and disposed, for the better
conseruation of all things in order, in the integritie of his
iudgement and discernings, to consider with rewards and
dignities such deseruers and beautified mindes, as himselfe
had seene forward by ready and feruent dispositions,
placing and crediting vnto them for their tryed and approoued
seruices, such degree of trust and superioritie, as might both
stand in stead towards a recompence of their trauailes, and
also the more incourage them to go on with him in perfecting
things necessarie to vphold societies and vocations,
wherevnto he had lately sorted the whole people. Afterward, such of
<pagebreak id="C2V" />
all sorts as had defected and come short in sufficiencie, to
performe matters and places committed vnto them, so as the rest
receiued losse and hinderance by their fault or negligence; such
iniurious deceiuers were deposed, thrust downe, and
disfranchised, as persons vnfit to become the strong vertues and
properties beseeming men euer after compelled to exercise weake
things, and withall enioyned to liue out the rest of their dayes
in the company and conuersation of women. What occasion
soeuer notwithstanding vrging the vse of them, such were
neuer recalled nor suffered to execute duties amongst men. <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">DUNSTABLE'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thinke it hath bin the warmth
of gentle bloud, which beating within your brest, hath thrust
out this formalitie you indent your words withall: could my
consent helpe towards it, you should be made a gentle maister
Scriuener, for your orderly frame of words are so well suted,
that as me thinketh you haue much amended the old patterne
you began with in the morning. If you mistake me in sence
also no worse hereafter, it shall not repent me to talke of this
fashion yet a while longer with you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Though of my   
selfe
it soundeth not well, yet without brag be it spoken, there be
Gentlemen of bloud in this countrey that sit not so high in the
<pagebreak id="C3R" />
subsidie booke, neither are rated in furnitures and setting out of
men to the warres in sort as I am. <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">HUDDLES'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="C3V" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunstable.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had I thought your maistership would haue
taken my free speeches in so ill part, which concerned onely
my selfe and my ready abilitie, to forward to my power my
Prince her occasions and seruices, I would haue forborne to
haue vttered my minde, wherein I onely grieued, that any
should exempt themselues or forbeare to extend their
vttermost helpe and indeuour in such good workes. My
intent was not to repine at my owne easie charges, especially
to performe so necessarie a dutie. If it please you to forget
my foolish speeches and scattering questions, beginning
where the matter brake off, you shall fauour me; in that I
haue a speciall desire to heare at the full, you hauing so
notablie entred into the declaration thereof. You left at
absolute vertues, which are the gifts of nature, and accompany
Gentlemen from their birth. <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">HUDDLE'S SPEECH OMITTED.</comment>
<pagebreak id="C4R" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Belike then, if the worthie
progenitour had attained to the tipe of all perfections, his worthie
of-spring had at the first immediately bene seasoned with
that most precious liquor, according to the influence into
the former vessell. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yea vndoubtedly, but the mysterie
of the perfection celestiall, which you rightly termed a most
precious influence, it is too deuine to dwell vpon earth, or to
be discust by mortall sence and vnderstanding: but the next
vnto that omnipotencie, are Kings and Princes, because they
receiue theyr blessings from God directly, without other
benefit or additament whatsoeuer. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I pray you   
Sir,
how to diuerse without the benefit of this generous bloud,
attaine to such ripenesse as may make them worthie high place
and dignitie in the word? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Huddle.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Through forward
inclination and disposition, taken with the loue and desire to       
immitate 
such seruiceable vertues as they haue seene approoued and
rewarded in others, whose more properly at the first they
were, and so vpon iust cause, are both receiued and held
worthie men. In the first vertuous man, I shewed you euen now,
after his good speed was seene, and the way knowne, how he
did great things, others were stirred vp to haue pleasure and
delight in the like, yet such also as were better endued, and of a
more ready motion then the rest. For all could neither be 
incited by example, nor forced by compulsion to needfull and
concerning duties, to the pleasuring of themselues. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
By 
this reckening, wisdome to forethinke is not the least helpe 
both to seeke and also to become great places attained vnto.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All my speeches haue tended to that end and purpose,
<pagebreak id="C4V" />
Yet first I shewed you, how bold courage did rouse and
waken men from out the cradle of securitie, before they were
assisted by consultation: euen then also had they failed of
resolution to enterprise and breake through difficulties, such also as
perhaps were repugnant vnto reason, and aboue that wit could
perswade to be possible, then all had fainted, and nothing had
bene atcheiued. Now wit, arte, and counsell, which you spake
of right now, might haue serued them to prolong their plenty,
and to haue held them still in ease, to haue lestened and made
away by deuise, some of their superfluous and rising numbers;
but the strong vertue was first, and it preuailed to best
purposes and blessings. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Now sir I beseech you, speake
somewhat of the defects that were found in them that neuer came
forward. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I haue promised so to do. You may imagine,
that while the sunne is oppressed and surcharged with cloudes,
her vertue of comforting is for the while hindered; but when
she hath outwrought them, and broken thorough the black
prison, her light is then cleare, and her operations effectuall.
Likewise, whilest wantonnesse, belly cheare, and other
entangling delights, held men back from the vse and knowledge
of themselues: till I say, the maisterfull spirit had by maine
force, spoiled and driuen away all impediments, they could
purchase no freedome nor rest contented, vnlesse they were
able also to make a through conquest of themselues, then which
there could not be a greater victorie. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A faire and a
vertuous generation of worthy men, fit to take example at. <omission type="line" />

<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I pray you sir suffer me
yet to aske you this one question more, whether you thinke

set forward actions of greatest moment? <omission type="line" />
<comment type="compiler">HUDDLE'S SPEECH OMITTED: COURAGE IS THE MOST BENEFICIAL VIRTUE.</comment>
<pagebreak id="D2R" />
<omission type="line" /> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alas Sir, 
hard lodging and bad diet would be as good as a murthering 
piece to kill me out right. Yet for one day I could be content 
to see fashions amongst them with a quarter of a cold Pig, and 
an <font>Aqua vita</font> bottle vnder my girdle. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I can   
assure 
you, the warres and a colde stomack will neuer agree: at these 
yeares, you and I will pray from them that may. To martch 
in Armour, and to vnder the waight thereof, would breake 
our bones, being, as they are, cold, drie, and marrowlesse.          
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
My sonne telleth me, it is nothing now a daies to be a souldier, 
for they neuer come to pitcht fields, as they were wonte in 
our olde English warres, when the deuision of houses was.            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Is your sonne a Fencer that wayes to; I thinke he be an 
vniuersall man. But I pray you what warde hath he to beare of a
Musket bullet? it must needs be with his legges, for his hands
I know are not Pistoll proofe. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confesse those     
gunnes 
are diuelish things, and make many men runne away that other 
wayes would not turne their heads. But when I said a Souldier, 
I meant the Generall or commander in the warres. He telleth 
me many times he could discharge the place himselfe, though 
he neuer saw an enemy in the face. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not vnlike, but shew 
me I pray you, wherein the commaunders office consisteth, 
according to that you haue heard your sonne report.                  
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunstable.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 
Marrie sir, in ordering and ordaining the field, and in well 
lodging his campe, neare riuers and places defended from 
contagious noisome winds. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What shall then be the Lord 
Marshall his place vnder him, if his Generalship be thus imploied!
<pagebreak id="D2V" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dunst.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He saith <font>Hanniball</font> supplied both the romes      
himself, and
made the offices one: he alwaies when he came to ioyne
battels and prepare his fights, bestowed his footmen vpon hils and
places of aduantage, and his horsemen in the plaines and euen
valleis beneath. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If yong <font>Hanniball</font> your sonne     
were chiefe
in the field, his footmen should be Astronomers or wisards, to
know when they should not fight, then from the hilles to giue
signes to the horsemen to be gone, and flie away together, and
so your sonne his hoast should consist of a running campe.
Though I was neuer worthy to beare the name of a companion
in the warres, yet vnder his conduct I could be content to refuse
the offer of a very good place and office. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dun.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What       
office is 
that, and why? I pray you sir let me know. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Hud.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No 
entertainment could tempt me to be maister of his carriages, to      
carrie &amp; 
recarrie hils and dales, windes and waters; besides I know the 
great librarie that hath cost you so many quarters of Corne,
