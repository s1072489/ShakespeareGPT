<nonSpeech>SCENE, <font>A Gallery in Lady</font> Bountyful's <font>House</font> .</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Mrs.</font> Sullen <font>and</font> Dorinda <font>meeting</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Morrow, my dear Sister; are you for Church this
Morning?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mrs. Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Any where to Pray; for Heaven alone can help
me: But, I think, <font>Dorinda</font> , there's no Form of Prayer in the
Liturgy against bad Husbands. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But there's a Form of Law in <font>Doctors-Commons</font> ; 
and I
swear, Sister <font>Sullen</font> , rather than see you thus continually
discontented, I would advise you to apply to that: For besides the
part that I bear in your vexatious Broils, as being Sister to the
Husband, and Friend to the Wife; your Example gives me such 
an Impression of Matrimony, that I shall be apt to condemn
my Person to a long Vacation all its Life. -- But supposing,
Madam, that you brought it to a Case of Separation, what
you urge against your Husband? My Brother is, first, the most
constant Man alive.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The most constant Husband, I grant'ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He never sleeps from you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, he always sleeps with me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He allows you a Maintenance suitable to your       
Quality. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Maintenance! do you take me, Madam, for an 
hospital Child, that I must sit down, and bless my Benefactors for
Meat, Drink and Clothes? As I take it, Madam, I brought your
Brother Ten thousand Pounds, out of which, I might expect
some pretty things, call'd Pleasures.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You share in all the Pleasures that the Country    
affords.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Country Pleasures! Racks and Torments! dost
think, Child, that my Limbs were made for leaping of Ditches,
and clambring over Stiles; or that my Parents wisely foreseeing
my future Happiness in Country-pleasures, had early instructed
me in the rural Accomplishments of drinking fat Ale, playing at
Whisk, and smoaking Tobacco with my Husband; or of 
spreading of Plaisters, brewing of Diet-drinks, and stilling
Rosemary-Water with the good old Gentlewoman, my 
Mother-in-Law. 
<pagebreak id="12" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm sorry, Madam, that it is not more in our power 
to 
divert you; I cou'd wish indeed that our Entertainments were
a little more polite, or your Taste a little less refin'd: But,
pray, Madam, how came the Poets and Philosophers that
labour'd so much in hunting after Pleasure, to place it at last in
a Country Life?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because they wanted Money, Child, to find out
the Pleasures of the Town: Did you ever see a Poet or
Philosopher worth Ten thousand Pound; if you can shew me such a
Man, I'll lay you Fifty Pound you'll find him somewhere within 
the weekly Bills. -- Not that I disapprove rural Pleasures, as
the Poets have painted them; in their Landschape every <font>Phillis</font>
has her <font>Coridon</font> , every murmuring Stream, and every flowry
Mead gives fresh Alarms to Love. -- Besides, you'll find,
that their Couples were never marry'd: -- But yonder I see
my <font>Coridon</font> , and a sweet Swain it is, Heaven knows. -- Come,
<font>Dorinda</font> , don't be angry, he's my Husband, and your Brother;
and between both is he not a sad Brute?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have nothing to say to your part of him, you're  
the
best Judge.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Sister, Sister! if ever you marry, beware   
of a 
sullen, silent Sot, one that's always musing, but never thinks:
-- There's some Diversion in a talking Blockhead; and since
a Woman must wear Chains, I wou'd have the Pleasure of
hearing 'em rattle a little. -- Now you shall see, but take this by
the way; -- He came home this Morning at his usual Hour
of Four, waken'd me out of a sweet Dream of something else,
by tumbling over the Tea-table, which he broke all to pieces,
after his Man and he had rowl'd about the Room like sick
Passengers in a Storm, he comes flounce into Bed, dead as a Salmon
into a Fishmonger's Basket; his Feet cold as Ice, his Breath hot
as a Furnace, and his Hands and his Face as greasy as his Flanel
Night-cap. -- Oh Matrimony! -- He tosses up the
Clothes with a barbarous swing over his Shoulders, disorders the
whole Oeconomy of my Bed, leaves me half naked, and my
whole Night's Comfort is the tuneable Serenade of that wakeful
Nightingale, his Nose. -- O the Pleasure of counting the
melancholly Clock by a snoring Husband! -- But now, Sister,
you shall see how handsomely, being a well-bred Man, he will
beg my Pardon.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Head akes consumedly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you be pleased, my Dear, to drink Tea    
with us 
this Morning? it may do your Head good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Coffee? Brother.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pshaw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you please to dress and go to Church with 
me,
the Air may help you.

   <nonSpeech> <font>Scrub,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Day o'th Week is this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sunday</font> , an't please your Worship.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Sunday</font> ! bring me a Dram, and d'ye hear, set  
out the
Venison-Pasty <comment type="compiler">A SPACE IN SOURCE TEXT WHERE &quot;V&quot; IN &quot;Venison-Pasty&quot;  
SHOULD BE</comment> , and a Tankard of strong Beer upon the Hall-Table,
I'll go to breakfast. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stay, stay, Brother, you shan't get off so; you    
were very
naught last Night, and must make your Wife Reparation; come,
come, Brother, won't you ask Pardon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For being drunk last Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I can afford it, can't I?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I can't, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you may let it alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But I must tell you, Sir, that this is not to 
be born.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm glad on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is the Reason, Sir, that you use me thus
inhumanely?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Scrub?</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Get things ready to shave my Head. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have a care of coming near his Temples,       
<font>Scrub</font> , for
fear you meet something there that may turn the Edge of your
Razor. -- Inveterate Stupidity! did you ever know so hard,
so obstinate a Spleen as his? O Sister, Sister! I shall never ha'
Good of the Beast till I get him to Town; <font>London</font> , dear
<font>London</font> is the Place for managing and breaking a Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And has not a Husband the same Opportunities there
for humbling a Wife?
<pagebreak id="14" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, Child, 'tis a standing Maxim in       
conjugal 
Discipline, that when a Man wou'd enslave his Wife, he
hurries her into the Country; and when a Lady would be arbitrary
with her Husband, she wheedles her Booby up to Town. -- A
Man dare not play the Tyrant in <font>London</font> , because there are so
many Examples to encourage the Subject to rebel. O <font>Dorinda,
Dorinda</font> ! a fine Woman may do any thing in <font>London</font> : O'my
Conscience, she may raise an Army of Forty thousand Men.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fancy, Sister, you have a mind to be trying your 
Power
that way here in <font>Litchfield</font> ; you have drawn the <font>French</font> Count
to your Colours already.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The <font>French</font> are a People that can't live   
without
their Gallantries.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And some <font>English</font> that I know, Sister, are not  
averse to
such Amusements.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Sister, since the Truth must out, it    
may do
as well now as hereafter; I think one way to rouse my
Lethargick sotish Husband, is, to give him a Rival; Security begets
Negligence in all People, and Men must be alarm'd to make 'em
alert in their Duty: Women are like Pictures of no Value in the
Hands of a Fool, till he hears Men of Sense bid high for the
Purchase.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This might do, Sister, if my Brother's Understanding
were to be convinc'd into a Passion for you; but I fancy there's
a natural Aversion of his side; and I fancy, Sister, that you
don't come much behind him, if you dealt fairly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I own it, we are united Contradictions, Fire  
and
Water: But I cou'd be contented, with a great many other Wives,
to humour the censorious Mob, and give the World an
Appearance of living well with my Husband, cou'd I bring him
but to dissemble a little Kindness to keep me in Countenance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But how do you know, Sister, but that instead of
rousing your Husband by this Artifice to a counterfeit Kindness, he
should awake in a real Fury.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let him: -- If I can't entice him to the one, I
wou'd provoke him to the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But how must I behave my self between ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must assist me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, against my own Brother!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's but half a Brother, and I'm your entire  
Friend:
<pagebreak id="15" />
If I go a step beyond the Bounds of Honour, leave me; till
then I expect you should go along with me in every thing, while
I trust my Honour in your Hands, you may trust your Brother's
in mine. -- The Count is to dine here to Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis a strange thing, Sister, that I can't like    
that Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You like nothing, your time is not come; Love
and Death have their Fatalities, and strike home one time or
other: -- You'll pay for all one Day, I warrant'ye. -- But,
come, my Lady's Tea is ready, and 'tis almost Church-time.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>

 <head>SCENE, THE INN.</head> 

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Aimwell <font>dress'd, and</font> Archer.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And was she the Daughter of the House?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Landlord is so blind as to think so; but I dare
swear she has better Blood in her Veins.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why dost think so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because the Baggage has a pert <font> <foreign>Je ne scai    
quoi</foreign> </font> , she reads
Plays, keeps a Monkey, and is troubled with Vapours.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By which Discoveries I guess that you know more of 
her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not yet, Faith, the Lady gives her self Airs,     
forsooth,
nothing under a Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me take her in hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Say one Word more o'that, and I'll declare my self,
spoil your Sport there, and every where else; look'ye, <font>Aimwell</font> ,
every Man in his own Sphere.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Right; and therefore you must pimp for your Master.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the usual Forms, good Sir, after I have serv'd 
my
self. -- But to our Business: -- You are so well dress'd,
<font>Tom</font> , and make so handsome a Figure, that I fancy you may do
Execution in a Country Church; the exteriour part strikes first,
and you're in the right to make that Impression favourable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's something in that which may turn to 
Advantage: The Appearance of a Stranger in a Country Church draws
as many Gazers as a blazing Star; no sooner he comes into the
Cathedral, but a Train of Whispers runs buzzing round the
Congregation in a moment; -- Who is he? whence comes he?
do you know him? -- Then I, Sir, tips me the Verger with
half a Crown; he pockets the Simony, and Inducts me into the
<pagebreak id="16" />
best Pue in the Church, I pull out my Snuff-box, turn my self
round, bow to the Bishop, or the Dean, if he be the
commanding Officer; single out a Beauty, rivet both my Eyes to hers, 
set
my Nose a bleeding by the Strength of Imagination, and shew
the whole Church my concern by my endeavouring to hide it;
after the Sermon, the whole Town gives me to her for a Lover,
and by perswading the Lady that I am a dying for her, the
Tables are turn'd, and she in good earnest falls in Love with me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's nothing in this, <font>Tom</font> , without a      
Precedent;
but instead of riveting your Eyes to a Beauty, try to fix 'em
upon a Fortune, that's our Business at present.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pshaw, no Woman can be a Beauty without a Fortune.
-- Let me alone, for I am a Mark'sman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Tom.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When were you at Church before, pray?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Um -- I was there at the Coronation.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And how can you expect a Blessing by going to     
Church
now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Blessing! nay, <font>Frank</font> , I ask but for a Wife.   
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Truly the Man is not very unreasonable in his     
Demands.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit at the opposite Door.</font> </nonSpeech>
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Bonniface <font>and</font> Cherry.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well Daughter, as the saying is, have you brought
<font>Martin</font> to confess?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Father, don't put me upon getting any thing 
out 
of a Man; I'm but young you know, Father, and I don't
understand Wheedling.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Young! why you Jade, as the saying is, can any
Woman wheedle that is not young, you'r Mother was useless at
five and twenty; not wheedle! would you make your Mother
a Whore and me a Cuckold, as the saying is? I tell you his
Silence confesses it, and his Master spends his Money so freely, and
is so much a Gentleman every manner of way that he must be a
Highwayman.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Gibbet <font>in a Cloak</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Landlord, Landlord, is the Coast clear?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Mr. <font>Gibbet</font> , what's the News?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter, ask no Questions, all fair and          
honourable,
here, my dear <font>Cherry</font> </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gives her a Bag.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two hundred      
Sterling
<pagebreak id="17" />
Pounds as good as any that ever hang'd or sav'd a Rogue; lay
'em by with the rest, and here -- Three wedding or mourning
Rings, 'tis much the same you know -- Here, two
Silver-hilted Swords; I took those from Fellows that never shew any
part of their Swords but the Hilts: Here is a Diamond Necklace
which the Lady hid in the privatest place in the Coach, but I
found it out: This Gold Watch I took from a Pawn-broker's
Wife; it was left in her Hands by a Person of Quality, there's
the Arms upon the Case.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But who had you the Money from?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! poor Woman! I pitied her; -- From a poor Lady
just elop'd from her Husband, she had made up her Cargo, and
was bound for <font>Ireland</font> , as hard as she cou'd drive; she told me
of her Husband's barbarous Usage, and so I left her half a
Crown: But I had almost forgot, my dear <font>Cherry</font> , I have a
Present for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is't?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Pot of Cereuse, my Child, that I took out of a   
Lady's
under Pocket.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, Mr. <font>Gibbet</font> , do you think that I paint?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, you Jade, your Betters do; I'm sure the Lady  
that
I took it from had a Coronet upon her Handkerchief. -- Here,
take my Cloak, and go, secure the Premisses.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will secure 'em. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, heark'ye, where's <font>Hounslow</font> and            
<font>Bagshot</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They'll be here to Night.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> D'ye know of any other Gentlemen o'the Pad on this
Road?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fancy that I have two that lodge in the House    
just now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Devil! how d'ye smoak 'em?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, the one is gone to Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's suspitious, I must confess.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And the other is now in his Master's Chamber; he
pretends to be Servant to the other, we'll call him out, and pump
him a little.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my Heart.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Martin</font> , Mr. <font>Martin</font> ?
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Martin <font>combing a Perrywig, and singing</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Roads are consumed deep; I'm as dirty as old
<pagebreak id="18" />
<font>Brentford</font> at <font>Christmas</font> . -- A good pretty Fellow that; who's
Servant are you, Friend?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Master's.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Really.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's much. -- The Fellow has been at the Bar by
his Evasions: -- But, pray, Sir, what is your Master's Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Tall, all dall</font> ; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>sings and combs the     
Perrywig</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue> This is
the most obstinate Curl --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask you his Name?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Name, Sir, -- <font>Tall, all dal</font> -- I never ask'd  
him his
Name in my Life. <font>Tall, all dall.</font>
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What think you now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Plain, plain, he talks now as if he were before a  
Judge:
But, pray, Friend, which way does your Master travel?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Horseback.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well again, an old Offender, right; -- But, I
mean does he go upwards or downwards?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Downwards, I fear, Sir: <font>Tall, all</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm afraid my Fate will be a contrary way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha! Mr. <font>Martin</font> you're very arch. -- This
Gentleman is only travelling towards <font>Chester</font> , and wou'd be
glad of your Company, that's all. -- Come, Captain, you'll
stay to Night, I suppose; I'll shew you a Chamber -- Come,
Captain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Farewel, Friend -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Captain, your Servant. -- Captain! a pretty
Fellow; s'death, I wonder that the Officers of the Army don't
conspire to beat all Scoundrels in Red, but their own.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Cherry.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gone! and <font>Martin</font> here! I hope he did not      
listen; I
wou'd have the Merit of the discovery all my own, because I
wou'd oblige him to love me. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mr. <font>Martin</font> , who was
that Man with my Father?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some Recruiting Serjeant, or whip'd out Trooper, I
suppose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> All's safe, I find.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, my Dear, have you con'd over the Catechise
I taught you last Night?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, question me.
<pagebreak id="19" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is Love? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Love is I know not what, it comes I know not how,
and goes I know not when.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, an apt Scholar. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Chucks her under  
the Chin.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Where does Love enter?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Into the Eyes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And where go out?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I won't tell'ye.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What are Objects of that Passion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Youth, Beauty, and clean Linen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Reason?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The two first are fashionable in Nature, and the  
third
at Court.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's my Dear: What are the Signs and Tokens of
that Passion?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A stealing Look, a stammering Tongue, Words
improbable, Designs impossible, and Actions impracticable.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's my good Child, kiss me. -- What must a 
Lover do to obtain his Mistress.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He must adore the Person that disdains him, he must
bribe the <comment type="compiler">A SPACE IN SOURCE TEXT WHERE &quot;e&quot; IN &quot;the&quot; SHOULD BE</comment>    
Chambermaid that betrays him, and court the
Footman that laughs at him; -- He must, he must --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Child, I must whip you if you don't mind your
Lesson; he must treat his --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, ay, he must treat his Enemies with Respect, his
Friends with Indifference, and all the World with Contempt;
he must suffer much, and fear more; he must desire much, and
hope little; in short, he must embrace his Ruine, and throw
himself away.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Had ever Man so hopeful a Pupil as mine? come, my
Dear, why is Love call'd a Riddle?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because being blind, he leads those that see, and 
tho'
a Child, he governs a Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Mighty well. -- And why is Love pictur'd blind?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because the Painters out of the weakness or       
privilege
of their Art chose to hide those Eyes that they cou'd not draw.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's, my dear little Scholar, kiss me again. -- 
And
why shou'd Love, that's a Child, govern a Man?
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because that a Child is the end of Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And so ends Love's Catechism. -- And now, my Dear,
we'll go in, and make my Master's Bed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold, hold, Mr. <font>Martin</font> , -- You have taken a  
great
deal of Pains to instruct me, and what d'ye think I have learn't
by it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That your Discourse and your Habit are            
Contradictions,
and it wou'd be nonsense in me to believe you a Footman any
longer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Oons, what a Witch it is!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Depend upon this, Sir, nothing in this Garb shall 
ever
tempt me; for tho' I was born to Servitude, I hate it: -- Own
your Condition, swear you love me, and then -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And then we shall go make the Bed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must know then, that I am born a Gentleman, my
Education was liberal; but I went to <font>London</font> a younger
Brother, fell into the Hands of Sharpers, who stript me of my
Money, my Friends disown'd, and now my Necessity brings me
to what you see.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then take my Hand -- promise to marry me
before you sleep, and I'll make you Master of two thousand
Pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Two thousand Pound that I have this Minute in my
own Custody; so throw off your Livery this Instant, and I'll go
find a Parson.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What said you? A Parson!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! do you scruple?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Scruple! no, no, but -- two thousand Pound you
say?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> S'death, what shall I do -- but heark'e, Child,   
what 
need you make me Master of your self and Money, when you
may have the same pleasure out of me, and still keep your
Fortune in your Hands.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you won't marry me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I wou'd marry you, but -- 
<pagebreak id="21" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O sweet, Sir, I'm your humble Servant, you're     
fairly
caught, wou'd you perswade me that any Gentleman who cou'd
bear the Scandal of wearing a Livery, wou'd refuse two 
thousand Pound let the Condition be what it wou'd -- no, no, Sir,
-- but I hope you'll Pardon the Freedom I have taken, since it
was only to inform my self of the Respect I ought to pay
you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Going.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fairly bit, by <font>Jupiter</font> -- hold, hold, and     
have you
actually two thousand Pound.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cher.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I have my Secrets as well as you -- when     
you please
to be more open, I shall be more free, and be assur'd that I
have Discoveries that will match yours, be what they will --
in the mean while be satisfy'd that no Discovery I make shall
ever hurt you, but beware of my Father. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So -- we're like to have as many Adventures in    
our Inn,
as <font>Don Quixote</font> had in his -- let me see, -- two thousand
Pound! if the Wench wou'd promise to dye when the Money
were spent, I gad, one wou'd marry her, but the Fortune may
go off in a Year or two, and the Wife may live -- Lord
knows how long? then an Inkeeper's Daughter; ay that's the
Devil -- there my Pride brings me off.

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Mrs.</font> Sullen, Dorinda.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha, my dear Sister, let me embrace    
thee,
now we are Friends indeed! for I shall have a Secret of yours,
as a Pledge for mine -- now you'll be good for something, I
shall have you conversable in the Subjects of the Sex.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But do you think that I am so weak as to fall in   
Love
with a Fellow at first sight?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pshaw! now you spoil all, why shou'd not we be
as free in our Friendships as the Men? I warrant you the
Gentleman has got to his Confident already, has avow'd his Passion,
toasted your Health, call'd you ten thousand Angels, has run over
your Lips, Eyes, Neck, Shape, Air and every thing, in a 
Description that warms their Mirth to a second Enjoyment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Hand, Sister, I an't well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, -- she's breeding already -- come Child   
up with
it -- hem a little -- so -- now tell me, don't you like the
Gentleman that we saw at Church just now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Man's well enough.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well enough! is he not a Demigod, a           
<font>Narcissus</font> ,
a Star, the Man i'the Moon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Sister, I'm extreamly ill.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall I send to your Mother, Child, for a     
little of
her Cephalick Plaister to put to the Soals of your Feet, or shall
I send to the Gentleman, for something for you? -- Come,
unlace your Steas, unbosome your self -- the Man is
perfectly a pretty Fellow, I saw him when he first came into
Church.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw him too, Sister, and with an Air that shone,
methought like Rays about his Person.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well said, up with it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No forward Coquett Behaviour, no Airs to set him   
off,
no study'd Looks nor artful Posture, -- but Nature did it all -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> better and better -- one Touch more -- come. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But then his Looks -- did you observe his Eyes?
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes, I did -- his Eyes, well, what of his
Eyes?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sprightly, but not wandring; they seem'd to view,  
but
never gaz'd on any thing but me -- and then his Looks so
humble were, and yet so noble, that they aim'd to tell me that
he cou'd with Pride dye at my Feet, tho' he scorn'd Slavery any
where else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Physick works purely -- How d'ye find your
self now, my Dear?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hem! much better, my Dear -- O here comes our
Mercury! </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Scrub.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well <font>Scrub</font> , what News of the
Gentleman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, I have brought you a Packet of News.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Open it quickly, come.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In the first place I enquir'd who the Gentleman  
was?
they told me he was a Stranger, Secondly, I ask'd what the
Gentleman was, they answer'd and said, that they never saw
him before. Thirdly, I enquir'd what Countryman he was,
they reply'd 'twas more than they knew. Fourthly, I
demanded whence he came, their Answer was, they cou'd not tell.
And Fifthly, I ask'd whither he went, and they reply'd they
knew nothing of the matter, -- and this is all I cou'd learn.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what do the People say, can't they guess?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> why some think he's a Spy, some guess he's a
Mountebank, some say one thing, some another; but for my own part,
I believe he's a Jesuit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Jesuit! why a Jesuit?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> because he keeps his Horses always ready sadled, 
and
his Footman talks French.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Footman!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, he and the Count's Footman were Gabbering    
French
like two intreaguing Ducks in a Mill-Pond, and I believe they
talk'd of me, for they laugh'd consumedly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What sort of Livery has the Footman?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Livery! Lord, Madam, I took him for a Captain,
he's so bedizen'd with Lace, and then he has Tops to his Shoes,
up to his mid Leg, a silver headed Cane dangling at his Nuckles,
-- he carries his Hands in his Pockets just so -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Walks in the
French Air</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> and has a fine long Perriwig ty'd up in a Bag --
Lord, Madam, he's clear another sort of Man than I.
<pagebreak id="24" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That may easily be -- but what shall we do
now, Sister?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have it -- This Fellow has a world of            
Simplicity, and
some Cunning, the first hides the latter by abundance -- <font>Scrub</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We have a great mind to know who this Gentleman is,
only for our Satisfaction.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Madam, it would be a Satisfaction, no doubt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You must go and get acquainted with his Footman, and
invite him hither to drink a Bottle of your Ale, because you're
Butler to Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Madam, I am Butler every Sunday.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O brave, Sister, O my Conscience, you         
understand
the Mathematicks already -- 'tis the best Plot in the World, your
Mother, you know, will be gone to Church, my Spouse will be
got to the Ale-house with his Scoundrels, and the House will be our
own -- so we drop in by Accident and ask the Fellow some
Questions our selves. In the Countrey you know any Stranger is
Company, and we're glad to take up with the Butler in a
Country Dance, and happy if he'll do us the Favour.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh! Madam, you wrong me, I never refus'd your
Ladyship the Favour in my Life.

I read her thousands in her Looks, she look'd like <font>Ceres</font> in her

Harvest, Corn, Wine and Oil, Milk and Honey, Gardens,
Groves and Purling Streams play'd on her plenteous Face.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her Face! her Pocket, you mean; the Corn, Wine
and Oil lies there. In short, she has ten thousand Pound, that's
the English on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Her Eyes -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are Demi-Cannons to be sure, so I won't stand their

   <nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray excuse me, my Passion must have vent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Passion! what a plague, d'ee think these          
Romantick Airs
will do our Business? Were my Temper as extravagant as yours,
my Adventures have something more Romantick by half.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Adventures!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, The Nymph that with her twice ten hundred    
Pounds
   With brazen Engine hot, and Quoif clear starch'd
   Can fire the Guest in warming of the Bed --
There's a Touch of Sublime <font>Milton</font> for you, and the Subject but
an Inn-keeper's Daughter; I can play with a Girl as an Angler
do's with his Fish; he keeps it at the end of his Line, runs it
up the Stream, and down the Stream, till at last, he brings it to
hand, tickles the Trout, and so whips it into his Basket.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, there's a Captain below; as the saying   
is, that

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen of his Coat are welcome every where; will
you make him a Complement from me, and tell him I should
be glad of his Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Who shall I tell him, Sir, wou'd. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha! that Stroak was well thrown in -- I'm only
a Traveller like himself, and wou'd be glad of his Company,
that's all.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Brother's to be sure, he wou'd never give me any
thing else, so I'll make bold with his Honour this bout -- you

before, I hope. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And pray, Sir, how came I by the Honour of seeing
you now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I scorn to intrude upon any Gentleman -- but my
Landlord --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Sir, I ask your Pardon, you're the Captain he   
told
me of.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> At your Service, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Regiment, may I be so bold?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A marching Regiment, Sir, an old Corps.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very old, if your Coat be Regimental,              
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You
have serv'd abroad, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, in the Plantations, 'twas my Lot to be   
sent
into the worst Service, I wou'd have quitted it indeed, but a Man
of Honour, you know -- Besides 'twas for the good of my
<pagebreak id="27" />
Country that I shou'd be abroad -- Any thing for the good
of one's Country -- I'm a <font>Roman</font> for that.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One of the first, I'll lay my Life                 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You found
the <font>West Indies</font> very hot, Sir?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Sir, too hot for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Sir, han't I seen your Face at <font>Will's</font>
Coffee-house?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, and at <font>White's</font> too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And where is your Company now, Captain?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They an't come yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, d'ye expect 'em here?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> They'll be here to Night, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Which way do they march?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Across the Country -- the Devil's in't, if I han't 
said
enough to encourage him to declare -- but I'm afraid he's not
right, I must tack about.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is your Company to quarter in <font>Litchfield</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In this House, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! all?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Company's but thin, ha, ha, ha, we are but three,
ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You're merry, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, Sir, you must excuse me, Sir, I understand the 
World,
especially, the Art of Travelling; I don't care, Sir, for
answering Questions directly upon the Road -- for I generally ride
with a Charge about me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Three or four, I believe. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I am credibly inform'd that there are Highway-men
upon this Quarter, not, Sir, that I cou'd suspect a Gentleman of
your Figure -- But truly, Sir, I have got such a way of
Evasion upon the Road, that I don't care for speaking Truth to
any Man.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Caution may be necessary -- Then I presume
you're no Captain?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not I, Sir, Captain is a good travelling Name, and 
so I
take it; it stops a great many foolish Inquiries that are generally
made about Gentlemen that travel, it gives a Man an Air of
something, and makes the Drawers obedient -- And thus far I
am a Captain, and no farther.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And pray, Sir, what is your true Profession?
<pagebreak id="28" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Sir, you must excuse me -- upon my Word, Sir,
I don't think it safe to tell you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha, upon my word I commend you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font>
Bonniface.</nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, Mr. <font>Bonniface</font> , what's the News?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's another Gentleman below, as the saying is, 
that
hearing you were but two, wou'd be glad to make the third Man
if you wou'd give him leave.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What is he?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Clergyman, as the saying is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Clergyman! is he really a Clergyman? or is it only
his travelling Name, as my Friend the Captain has it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Sir, he's a Priest and Chaplain to the French
Officers in Town.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Is he a French-man?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, Sir, born at <font>Brussels</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A French-man, and a Priest! I won't be seen in his
Company, Sir; I have a Value for my Reputation, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but Captain, since we are by our selves -- Can
he speak English, Landlord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very well, Sir, you may know him, as the saying    
is, to
be a Foreigner by his Accent, and that's all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then he has been in <font>England</font> before?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never, Sir, but he's a Master of Languages, as the
saying is, he talks Latin, it do's me good to hear him talk Latin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you understand Latin, Mr. <font>Bonniface</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not I, Sir, as the saying is, but he talks it so   
very fast
that I'm sure it must be good.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray desire him to walk up.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Here he is, as the saying is.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Foigard.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Save you, Gentlemen's, both.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A French-man! Sir, your most humble Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Och, dear Joy, I am your most faithful Shervant,  
and
yours alsho.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Doctor, you talk very good English, but you have a
mighty Twang of the Foreigner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My English is very vel for the vords, but we      
Foregners
you know cannot bring our Tongues about the Pronunciation
so soon.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Foreigner! a down-right Teague by this Light.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you born in <font>France</font> , Doctor.
<pagebreak id="29" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was educated in <font>France</font> , but I was borned   
at <font>Brussels</font> ,
I am a Subject of the King of <font>Spain</font> , Joy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What King of <font>Spain</font> , Sir, speak.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon my Shoul Joy, I cannot tell you as yet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Captain, that was too hard upon the Doctor,   
he's
a Stranger.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O let him alone, dear Joy, I am of a Nation that  
is not
easily put out of Countenance.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Come, Gentlemen, I'll end the Dispute. -- Here,
Landlord, is Dinner ready?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Bon.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon the Table, as the saying is.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Gentlemen -- pray -- that Door -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Foig.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no fait, the Captain must lead.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aim.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Doctor, the Church is our Guide.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gib.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay, so it is. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit foremost, they

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Archer <font>and</font> Scrub <font>singing, and hugging one         
another</font> ,
Scrub <font>with a Tankard in his Hand</font> , Gipsey <font>listning at a        
distance</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Tall, all dall</font> -- Come, my dear Boy -- Let's
have that Song once more.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, we shall disturb the Family; -- But will  
you
be sure to keep the Secret?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pho! upon my Honour, as I'm a Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis enough. -- You must know then that my Master 
is
the Lord Viscount <font>Aimwell</font> ; he fought a Duel t'other day in
<font>London</font> , wounded his Man so dangerously, that he thinks fit
to withdraw till he hears whether the Gentleman's Wounds be
mortal or not: He never was in this part of <font>England</font> before,
so he chose to retire to this Place, that's all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gip.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And that's enough for me. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And where were you when your Master fought?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We never know of our Masters Quarrels.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No! if our Masters in the Country here receive a
Challenge, the first thing they do is to tell their Wives; the
Wife tells the Servants, the Servants alarm the Tenants, and in
half an Hour you shall have the whole County in Arms.
<pagebreak id="30" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To hinder two Men from doing what they have no
mind for: -- But if you should chance to talk now of my
Business?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Talk! ay, Sir, had I not learn't the knack of    
holding
my Tongue, I had never liv'd so long in a great Family.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, ay, to be sure there are Secrets in all       
Families.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Secrets, ay; -- But I'll say no more. -- Come,
sit down, we'll make an end of our Tankard: Here -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my Heart; who knows but you and I may
come to be better acquainted, eh -- Here's your Ladies
Healths; you have three, I think, and to be sure there must be
Secrets among 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Secrets! Ay, Friend; I wish I had a Friend -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Am not I your Friend? come, you and I will be sworn
Brothers.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall we?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> From this Minute. -- Give me a kiss -- And now
Brother <font>Scrub</font> --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And now, Brother <font>Martin</font> , I will tell you a  
Secret that
will make your Hair stand on end: -- You must know, that I
am consumedly in Love.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's a terrible Secret, that's the Truth on't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Jade, <font>Gipsey</font> , that was with us just    
now in the
Cellar, is the arrantest Whore that ever wore a Petticoat; and
I'm dying for love of her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha -- Are you in love with her Person, or
her Vertue, Brother <font>Scrub</font> ? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I should like Vertue best, because it is more    
durable
than Beauty; for Vertue holds good with some Women long,
and many a Day after they have lost it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> In a Country, I grant ye, where no Woman's
Vertue is lost, till a Bastard be found.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, cou'd I bring her to a Bastard, I shou'd     
have her
all to my self; but I dare not put it upon that Lay, for fear of
being sent for a Soldier. -- Pray, Brother, how do you
Gentlemen in <font>London</font> like that same Pressing Act?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Very ill, Brother <font>Scrub</font> ; -- 'Tis the worst   
that ever
was made for us: Formerly I remember the good Days,
when we cou'd dun our Masters for our Wages, and if they
refused to pay us, we cou'd have a Warrant to carry 'em before a
<pagebreak id="31" />
Justice; but now if we talk of eating, they have a Warrant
for us, and carry us before three Justices.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And to be sure we go, if we talk of eating; for  
the
Justices won't give their own Servants a bad Example. Now this
is my Misfortune -- I dare not speak in the House, while
that Jade <font>Gipsey</font> dings about like a Fury -- Once I had the
better end of the Staff.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And how comes the Change now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, the Mother of all this Mischief is a Priest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Priest!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, a damn'd Son of a Whore of <font>Babylon</font> ,     
that came
over hither to say Grace to the <font>French</font> Officers, and eat up our
Provisions -- There's not a Day goes over his Head
without Dinner or Supper in this House.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How came he so familiar in the Family?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because he speaks <font>English</font> as if he had liv'd 
here all his
Life; and tells Lies as if he had been a Traveller from his Cradle.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And this Priest, I'm afraid has converted the     
Affections
of your <font>Gipsey</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Converted! ay, and perverted, my dear Friend: -- 
For
I'm afraid he has made her a Whore and a Papist. -- But this
is not all; there's the <font>French</font> Count and Mrs. <font>Sullen</font> ,       
they're in
the Confederacy, and for some private Ends of their own to be
sure.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A very hopeful Family yours, Brother <font>Scrub</font> ; I
suppose the Maiden Lady has her Lover too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not that I know; -- She's the best on 'em,       
that's the
Truth on't: But they take care to prevent my Curiosity, by
giving me so much Business, that I'm a perfect Slave. -- What
d'ye think is my Place in this Family?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Butler, I suppose.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, Lord help you -- I'll tell you -- Of a
<font>Monday</font> , I drive the Coach; of a <font>Tuesday</font> , I drive the       
Plough; on
<font>Wednesday</font> , I follow the Hounds; a <font>Thursday</font> , I dun the
Tenants; on <font>Fryday</font> , I go to Market; on <font>Saturday</font> , I draw
Warrants; and a <font>Sunday</font> , I draw Beer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha! if variety be a Pleasure in Life, you 
have
enough on't, my dear Brother -- But what Ladies are those?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ours, ours; that upon the right Hand is Mrs.      
<font>Sullen</font> ,
and the other is Mrs. <font>Dorinda</font> . -- Don't mind 'em, sit still,
Man --
<pagebreak id="32" />
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Mrs.</font> Sullen, <font>and</font> Dorinda.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have heard my Brother talk of my Lord
<font>Aimwell</font> , but they say that his Brother is the finer Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's impossible, Sister.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's vastly rich, but very close, they say.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No matter for that; if I can creep into his Heart, 
I'll
open his Breast, I warrant him: I have heard say, that People
may be guess'd at by the Behaviour of their Servants; I cou'd
wish we might talk to that Fellow.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So do I; for, I think he's a very pretty      
Fellow:
Come this way, I'll throw out a Lure for him presently.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>They walk a turn towards the opposite side of the Stage, Mrs.</font> 
Sullen
<font>drops her Glove</font> , Archer <font>runs, takes it up, and gives it to    
her</font> .</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Corn, Wine, and Oil, indeed -- But, I think, the
Wife has the greatest plenty of Flesh and Blood; she should be
my Choice -- Ah, a, say you so -- Madam -- Your
Ladyship's Glove.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, Sir, I thank you -- what a handsom Bow
the Fellow has?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bow! why I have known several Footmen come down
from <font>London</font> set up here for Dancing-Masters, and carry off the
best Fortunes in the Country.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Project, for ought I know,  
had been
better than ours, Brother <font>Scrub</font> -- Why don't you
introduce me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ladies, this is the strange Gentleman's Servant  
that
you see at Church to Day; I understood he came from <font>London</font> ,
and so I invited him to the Cellar, that he might show me the
newest Flourish in whetting my Knives.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And I hope you have made much of him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O yes, Madam, but the Strength of your Ladyship's
Liquour is a little too potent for the Constitution of your humble
Servant.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What, then you don't usually drink Ale?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Madam, my constant Drink is Tea, or a little  
Wine
and Water; 'tis prescrib'd me by the Physician for a Remedy
against the Spleen.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O la, O la! -- a Footman have the Spleen. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought that Distemper had been only proper 
to
People of Quality.
<pagebreak id="33" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, like all other Fashions it wears out, and so
descends to their Servants; tho' in a great many of us, I believe
it proceeds from some melancholly Particles in the Blood,
occasion'd by the Stagnation of Wages.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How affectedly the Fellow talks -- How long, pray,
have you serv'd your present Master?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not long; my Life has been mostly spent in the 
Service of the Ladies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And pray, which Service do you like best?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, the Ladies pay best; the Honour of serving
them is sufficient Wages; there is a Charm in their looks that
delivers a Pleasure with their Commands, and gives our Duty
the Wings of Inclination.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That Flight was above the pitch of a Livery;  
and,
Sir, wou'd not you be satisfied to serve a Lady again?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As a Groom of the Chamber, Madam, but not as a
Footman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose you serv'd as Footman before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For that Reason I wou'd not serve in that Post    
again;
for my Memory is too weak for the load of Messages that the
Ladies lay upon their Servants in <font>London</font> ; my Lady <font>Howd'ye</font> , 
the
last Mistress I serv'd call'd me up one Morning, and told me,
<font>Martin</font> , go to my Lady <font>Allnight</font> with my humble Service; tell
her I was to wait on her Ladyship yesterday, and left word with
Mrs. <font>Rebecca</font> , that the Preliminaries of the Affair she knows of,
are stopt till we know the concurrence of the Person that I know
of, for which there are Circumstances wanting which we shall
accommodate at the old Place; but that in the mean time there
is a Person about her Ladyship, that from several Hints and
Surmises, was accessary at a certain time to the disappointments that
naturally attend things, that to her knowledge are of more
Importance.

about half an Hour long; so I hapned to misplace two Syllables,
and was turn'd off, and render'd incapable --

Lieutenancy offer'd me three or four Times; but that is not Bread,
Madam -- I live much better as I do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, he sings rarely. -- I was thought to do

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Arch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Are you for Passion, or Humour?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Scrub.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O le! he has the purest Ballad about a Trifle --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Trifle! pray, Sir, let's have it.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I fancy, Sister, he may be some Gentlemen, a       
Friend of
my Lords, that his Lordship has pitch'd upon for his Courage,
Fidelity, and Discretion to bear him Company in this Dress,
and who, ten to one was his Second too.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Count happen'd to be the most agreeable Man

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And how did he relish it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He said little, mumbled something to himself,      
promis'd
to be guided by me: But here he comes -- 
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Sullen.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What singing was that I heard just now?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The singing in you're Head, my Dear, you
complain'd of it all Day.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You're impertinent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I was ever so, since I became one Flesh with  
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> One Flesh! rather two Carcasses join'd unnaturally
together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or rather a living Soul coupled to a dead Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, this is fine Encouragement for me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, my Wife shews you what you must do.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And my Husband shews you what you must suffer.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> S'death, why can't you be silent?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> S'death, why can't you talk?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you talk to any purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Do you think to any purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sister, heark'ye; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Whispers.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I shan't be 
home till it be
late. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What did he whisper to ye?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Dor.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That he wou'd go round the back way, come into the
Closet, and listen as I directed him. -- But let me beg you
once more, dear Sister, to drop this Project; for, as I told you
before, instead of awaking him to Kindness, you may provoke
him to a Rage; and then who knows how far his Brutality may
carry him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm provided to receive him, I warrant you: But
here comes the Count, vanish. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Dorinda.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="36" />
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Count</font> Bellair</nonSpeech><dialogue>
Don't you wonder, <font>Monsieur le Count</font> , that I was not at Church
this Afternoon?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I more wonder, Madam, that you go dere at all, or
how you dare to lift those Eyes to Heaven that are guilty of so
much killing.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> If Heaven, Sir, has given to my Eyes with the 
Power
of killing, the Virtue of making a Cure, I hope the one may
atone for the other.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Co.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O largely, Madam; wou'd your Ladyship be as ready to
apply the Remedy as to give the Wound? -- Consider, Madam,
I am doubly a Prisoner; first to the Arms of your General, then
to your more conquering Eyes; my first Chains are easy, there
a Ransom may redeem me, but from your Fetters I never shall
get free.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Alass, Sir, why shou'd you complain to me of
your Captivity, who am in Chains my self? you know, Sir,
that I am bound, nay, must <comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: most</comment> be tied up in that  
particular that
might give you ease: I am like you, a Prisoner of War -- Of
War indeed: -- I have given my Parole of Honour; wou'd
you break yours to gain your Liberty?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Co.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Most certainly I wou'd, were I a Prisoner among the
<font>Turks</font> ; dis is your Case; you're a Slave, Madam, Slave to the
worst of <font>Turks</font> , a Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There lies my Foible, I confess; no           
Fortifications,
no Courage, Conduct, nor Vigilancy can pretend to defend a
Place, where the Cruelty of the Governour forces the Garrison
to Mutiny.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Co.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And where de Besieger is resolv'd to die before de  
Place -- 
Here will I fix; </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Kneels.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With Tears, Vows, and Prayers
assault your Heart, and never rise till you surrender; or if I must
storm -- Love and St. <font>Michael</font> -- And so I begin the Attack -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Stand off -- Sure he hears me not -- And I    
cou'd
almost wish he -- did not. -- The Fellow makes love very
prettily. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But, Sir, why shou'd you put such a Value 
upon
my Person, when you see it despis'd by one that knows it so
much better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Co.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He knows it not, tho' he possesses it; if he but    
knew the
Value of the Jewel he is Master of, he wou'd always wear it next
his Heart. <comment type="compiler">PUNCTUATION AS IN SOURCE TEXT</comment> and sleep with it in    
his Arms.
<pagebreak id="37" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But since he throws me unregarded from him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And one that knows your Value well, comes by, and
takes you up, is it not Justice. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Goes to lay hold on her.</font> </nonSpeech>

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! Murther your Husband, to defend your Bully.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Bully! for shame, Mr. <font>Sullen</font> ; Bullies    
wear long
Swords, the Gentleman has none, he's a Prisoner you know -- 
I was aware of your Outrage, and prepar'd this to receive your
Violence, and, if Occasion were, to preserve my self against the
Force of this other Gentleman.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Madam, your Eyes be bettre Fire Arms than your
Pistol, they nevre miss.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What! court my Wife to my Face!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pray, Mr. <font>Sullen</font> , put up, suspend your   
Fury for a
Minute.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To give you time to invent an Excuse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I need none.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, for I heard every Sillable of your Discourse.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Coun,</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay! and begar, I tink de Dialogue was vera pretty.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I suppose, Sir, you heard something of   
your
own Barbarity.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Barbarity! oons what does the Woman               
<comment type="compiler">SOURCE TEXT: Women</comment> call Barbarity?
do I ever meddle with you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> As for you, Sir, I shall take another time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, begar, and so must I.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look'e, Madam, don't think that my Anger proceeds
from any Concern I have for your Honour, but for my own,
and if you can contrive any way of being a Whore without
making me a Cuckold, do it and welcome.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir, I thank you kindly, you wou'd allow me the
Sin but rob me of the Pleasure -- No, no, I'm resolv'd
never to venture upon the Crime without the Satisfaction of seeing 
you punish'd for't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then will you grant me this, my Dear? let any Body
else do you the Favour but that French-man, for I mortally hate
his whole Generation. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, Sir, that be ungrateful, for begar, I love   
some

<pagebreak id="38" /> 
   <nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Sir, -- Garzoon, Madam, I am not your Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis time to undeceive you, Sir, -- I         
believ'd your
Addresses to me were no more than an Amusement, and I hope
you will think the same of my Complaisance, and to convince
you that you ought, you must know, that I brought you hither
only to make you instrumental in setting me right with my
Husband, for he was planted to listen by my Appointment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By your Appointment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Certainly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And so, Madam, while I was telling twenty        
Stories to 
part you from your Husband, begar, I was bringing you 
together all the while.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Mrs. <font>Sull.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I ask your Pardon, Sir, but I hope this will  
give
you a Taste of the Vertue of the English Ladies.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Count.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Begar, Madam, your Vertue be vera Great, but     
Garzoon
