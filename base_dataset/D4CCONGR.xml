COMEDY.</head> 

 <head>ACT I. SCENE I.</head> 

<nonSpeech> <font>A Gallery in the Ld.</font> Touchwood's <font>House, with
 Chambers adjoyning</font> .</nonSpeech>

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Careless, <font>Crossing the Stage, with his Hat, Gloves, and
Sword in his Hands; as just risen from Table</font> : Mellefont
<font>following him</font> .</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Ned</font> , <font>Ned</font> , whither so fast? What, turn'd
flincher! Why, you wo' not leave us?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where are the Women? Pox I'm 
weary of guzling, and begin to think them 
the better Company.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then thy Reason staggers, and thou'rt almost
drunk.
<pagebreak id="2" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No faith, but your Fools grow noisy -- and if a 
man must endure the noise of words without Sence, I think 
the Women have the more Musical Voices, and become 
Nonsence better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, they are at that end of the Gallery; retired 
to their Tea, and Scandal; according to their Antient
Custome, after Dinner. -- But I made a pretence of 
following you, because I had something to say to you
in private, and I am not like to have many opportunities
this Evening. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And here's this Cox-Comb most Critically come to
interrupt you.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Brisk.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Boys, Boys, Lads, where are you? What do you
give ground? Mortgage for a Bottle, ha? <font>Careless</font> , this
is your trick; you're always spoiling Company by 
leaving it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And thou art always spoiling Company by coming
into 't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pooh, ha, ha, ha, I know you envy me. Spite,
proud spite, by the Gods! and burning envy. -- I'le
be judged by <font>Mellefont</font> here, who gives and takes  
Raillery better, you or I. Pox, Man, when I say you spoil 
Company by leaving it, I mean you leave no body for the 
Company to Laugh at. I think there I was with you, ha?
<font>Mellefont</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O' my word, <font>Brisk</font> , that was a home thrust; you
have silenc'd him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, my dear <font>Mellefont</font> , let me perish, if    
thou art
not the Soul of Conversation, the very Essence of Wit, 
and Spirit of Wine, -- the Deuce take me if there were three 
good things said; or one, understood, since thy 
Amputation from the body of our Society. -- He, I think that's
pretty and Metaphorical enough: I' Gad I could not have 
said it out of thy Company. -- <font>Careless</font> , ha?
<pagebreak id="3" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hum, ay, what is't?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, <font> <foreign>Mon Coeur</foreign> </font> ! What is't! nay gad I'll 
punish 
you for want of Apprehension: The Deuce take me if I
tell you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, hang him, he has no tast, -- but dear      
<font>Brisk</font>
excuse me, I have a little business.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prithee get thee gone; thou seest we are 
serious.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> We'll come immediately, if you'll but go in, and   
keep
up good Humour and Sense in the Company, prithee do,
they'll fall asleep else.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'gad so they will -- well I will, I will, Gad
you shall Command me from the <font>Zenith</font> to the <font>Nadir</font> . -- 
But the Deuce take me if I say a good thing till you come. -- 
But prithee dear Rogue, make haste, prithee make haste,
I shall burst else. -- And yonder your Uncle my Lord
<font>Touchwood</font> swears, he'll Disinherit you, and Sir <font>Paul Pliant</font>
threatens to disclaim you for a Son-in-Law, and my Lord
<font>Froth</font> won't Dance at your Wedding to Morrow; nor
the Deuce take me, I won't Write your Epithalamium -- 
and see what a condition you're like to be brought 
to.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I'll speak but three words, and follow you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Enough, enough, <font>Careless</font> , bring your        
Apprehension
along with you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pert Cox-Comb.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith 'tis a good natur'd Cox-Comb, and has very
Entertaining follies -- you must be more humane to him; at
this Juncture it will do me Service. -- I'll tell you, I
would have mirth continued this day at any rate; tho' 
Patience purchase folly, and Attention be paid with noise:
There are times when Sense may be unseasonable, as well as 
Truth. Prithee do thou wear none to day; but allow
<font>Brisk</font> to have Wit, that thou may'st seem a Fool.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, how now, why this extravagant proposition?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, I would have no room for serious design; for I 
am Jealous of a Plot. I would have Noise and 
Impertinence keep my Lady <font>Touchwood's</font> Head from Working: For
<pagebreak id="4" />
Hell is not more busie than her Brain, nor contains more 
Devils, than that Imaginations. 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I thought your fear of her had been over -- is not 
to Morrow appointed for your Marriage with <font>Cynthia</font> , and 
her Father Sir <font>Paul Plyant</font> , come to settle the Writings, this
day, on purpose?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> True, but you shall judge whether I have not reason
to be allarm'd. None besides you, and <font>Maskwell</font> , are 
acquainted with the Secret of my Aunt <font>Touchwood's</font> violent Passion 
for me. Since my first refusal of her Addresses, she has 
endeavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle; yet has
managed 'em with that subtilty, that to him they have born
the face of kindness; while her Malice, like a Dark 
Lanthorn, onely shone upon me, where it was directed. Still it
gave me less perplexity to prevent the success of her 
displeasure, than to avoid the importunities of her Love; and of
two evils, I thought my self favour'd in her aversion: But
whether urged by her despair, and the short prospect of time
she saw, to accomplish her designs; whether the hopes of her
revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the view of this my 
Marriage with <font>Cynthia</font> , I know not; but this Morning she
surpriz'd me in my Bed. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Was there ever such a Fury! 'tis well Nature has  
not
put into her Sexes power to Ravish. -- Well, bless us!
Proceed. What follow'd? 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What at first amaz'd me; for I look'd to have seen 
her
in all the Transports of a slighted and revengful Woman:
But when I expected Thunder from her Voice, and Lightning
in her Eyes; I saw her melted into Tears, and hush'd into
a Sigh. It was long before either of us spoke, Passion had 
ty'd her Tongue, and Amazement mine. -- In short, the 
Consequence was thus, she omitted nothing, that the most
violent Love could urge, or tender words express; which
when she saw had no effect: but still I pleaded Honour and 
nearness of Blood to my Uncle; then came the Storm I fear'd
at first: For starting from my Bed-side like a Fury, she flew
to my Sword, and with much ado I prevented her doing me
or her self a mischief: having disarm'd her; in a gust of 
<pagebreak id="5" />
Passion she left me, and in a resolution, confirm'd by a Thousand 
Curses, not to close her Eyes, till she had seen my ruin.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Exquisite Woman! But what the Devil does she
think, thou hast no more Sense, than to get an Heir upon 
her Body to Disinherit thy self: for as I take it this 
Settlement upon you, is, with a Proviso, that your Uncle have no
Children.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It is so. Well, the Service that you are to do me,
will be a Pleasure to your self; I must get you to engage
my Lady <font>Pliant</font> all this Evening, that my Pious Aunt
may not work her to her Interest. And if you chance 
to secure her to your self, you may incline her to mine. 
She's handsome, and knows it; is very silly, and thinks 
she has Sense, and has an old fond Husband.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess a very fair Foundation, for a Lover to 
build upon.    
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For my Lord <font>Froth</font> , he and his Wife will be
sufficiently taken up, with admiring one another, and
<font>Brisk's</font> Gallantry, as they call it. I'le observe my Uncle
my self; and <font>Jack Maskwell</font> has promised me, to watch
my Aunt narrowly, and give me notice upon any 
suspicion. As for Sir <font>Paul</font> , my wise Father-in-Law that is to
be, my Dear <font>Cynthia</font> has such a share in his Fatherly 
fondness, he would scarce make her a Moment uneasy, to have
her happy hereafter.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So, you have Mann'd your Works: But I wish
you may not have the weakest Guard, where the 
Enemy is strongest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Maskwell</font> , you mean; prithee why should you    
suspect
him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Faith I cannot help it, you know I never lik'd
him; I am a little Superstitious in Physiognomy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He has Obligations of Gratitude, to bind him
to me; his Dependance upon my Uncle is through my 
means.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Upon your Aunt, you mean.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Aunt!
<pagebreak id="6" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm mistaken if there be not a Familiarity 
between them, you do not suspect: For all her Passion for 
you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pooh, pooh, nothing in the World but his 
design to do me Service; and he endeavours to be well
in her esteem, that he may be able to effect it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, I shall be glad to be mistaken; but, your
Aunts Aversion in her Revenge, cannot be any way so
effectually shown, as in bringing forth a Child to 
Disinherit you. She is Handsome and cunning, and naturally
wanton. <font>Maskwell</font> is Flesh and Blood at best, and 
opportunities between them are frequent. His Affection to 
you, you have confessed, is grounded upon his Interest,
that, you have transplanted; and should it take Root 
in my Lady, I don't see what you can expect from the 
Fruit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess the Consequence is visible, were your 
suspicions just, -- but see the Company is broke up, let's
meet 'em.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lord</font> Touchwood, <font>Lord</font> Froth, <font>Sir</font> Paul Pliant,
<font>and</font> Brisk.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Out upon't, Nephew -- leave your 
Father-in-Law, and me, to maintain our ground against Young
People.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I beg your Lordships Pardon. -- We were just 
returning. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Were you, Son? Gadsbud much better as it 
is -- good, strange! I swear I'm almost Tipsy -- 
t'other Bottle would have been too powerful for me, -- 
as sure as can be it would. -- we wanted your 
Company, but Mr. <font>Brisk</font> -- where is he? I swear and
vow, he's a most facetious Person -- and the best 
Company. -- And, my Lord <font>Froth</font> , your Lordship is so
merry a Man, he, he, he.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O foy, Sir <font>Paul</font> , what do you mean? Merry!
O Barbarous! I'd as lieve you call'd me Fool.
<pagebreak id="7" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I protest and vow now, 'tis true; when
Mr. <font>Brisk</font> Jokes, your Lordships Laugh does so become you,
he, he, he.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ridiculous! Sir <font>Paul</font> you're strangely     
mistaken,
I find Champagne is powerful. I assure you, Sir <font>Paul</font> , I Laugh
at no bodies Jest but my own, or a Ladies; I assure you, Sir 
<font>Paul</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? how, my Lord? What, affront my Wit! Let 
me perish, do I never say any thing worthy to be Laugh'd
at?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O foy, don't misapprehend me, I don't say so, 
for
I often smile at your Conceptions. But there is nothing more
unbecoming a Man of Quality, than to Laugh; Jesu, 'tis 
such a Vulgar Expression of the Passion! every body can
Laugh. Then especially to Laugh at the Jest of an Inferiour
Person, or when any body else of the same Quality does
not Laugh with him. Ridiculous! To be pleased with
what pleases the Croud! Now when I Laugh, I always
Laugh alone.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I suppose that's because you Laugh at your own   
Jests,
I'gad, ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He, he, I swear tho', your Raillery provokes
me to a smile.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, my Lord, it's a sign I hit you in the Teeth, 
if
you show 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He, he, he, I swear that's so very pretty , I 
can't 
forbear.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I find a Quibble bears more sway in your Lordships
Face, than a Jest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sir <font>Paul</font> , if you please we'll retire to  
the 
Ladys, and Drink a Dish of Tea, to settle our Heads.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my heart. -- Mr. <font>Brisk</font> you'll come
to us, -- or call me when you're going to Joke, I'll be ready 
to Laugh incontinently.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit Ld.</font> Touch. <font>and Sir</font> Paul.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But does your Lordship never see Comedies?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O yes, sometimes, -- but I never Laugh.
<pagebreak id="8" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, no. -- Never Laugh indeed, Sir.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, why what d'ee go there for?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To distinguish my self from the 
Commonalty, and mortify the Poets; the Fellows grow so
Conceited, when any of their foolish Wit prevails 
upon the side Boxes. -- I swear, -- he, he, he,
I have often constrained my Inclinations to Laugh. -- 
He, he, he, to avoid giving them encouragement.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You are Cruel to your self, my Lord, as well as
Malicious to them.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I confess, I did my self some violence at     
first,
but now I think I have Conquer'd it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me perish, my Lord, but there is something   
very 
particular and novel in the Humour; 'tis true, it makes
against Wit, and I'm sorry for some Friends of mine that
Write, but -- I'gad, I love to be malicious. -- Nay,
Deuce take me, there's Wit in't too -- and Wit must be
foil'd by Wit; cut a Diamond with a Diamond; no other
way, I'gad.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Oh, I thought you would not be long, before 
you found out the Wit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Wit! In what? Where the Devil's the Wit, in not
Laughing when a Man has a mind to't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord, why can't you find it out? -- Why
there 'tis, in the not Laughing -- don't you Apprehend
me? -- My Lord, <font>Careless</font> , is a very honest Fellow, but
harkee, -- you understand me. Somewhat heavy, a 
little shallow, or so. -- Why I'll tell you now, suppose
now, you come up to me -- nay, prithee <font>Careless</font> be 
instructed. Suppose, as I was saying, you come up to me, holding
your sides, and Laughing as if you would bepiss your self -- 
I look grave, and ask the cause of this Immoderate Mirth. -- 
You Laugh on still, and are not able to tell me -- still I look
grave, not so much as smile. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Smile, no, what the Devil should you smile at, when
you suppose I can't tell you?
<pagebreak id="9" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pshaw, pshaw, prithee don't interrupt me. -- But
I tell you, you shall tell me -- at last. -- But it shall be
a great while first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, but prithee don't let it be a great while,  
because
I long to have it over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well then, you tell me, some good Jest, or very
Witty thing, Laughing all the while as if you were 
ready to die -- and I hear it, and look thus. -- Would not
you be disappointed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No; for if it were a witty thing, I should not 
expect you to understand it.  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O foy, Mr. <font>Careless</font> , all the World allow 
Mr.
<font>Brisk</font> to have Wit; my Wife says, he has a great deal. I hope
you think her a Judge?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pooh, my Lord, his Voice goes for nothing. -- 
I can't tell how to make him Apprehend, -- take
it t'other way. Suppose I say a witty thing to you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Care.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I shall be disappointed indeed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let him alone, <font>Brisk</font> , he is obstinately bent  
not to
be instructed.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm sorry for him, Deuce take me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Shall we go to the Ladies, my Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With all my heart, methinks we are a 
Solitude without 'em.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or, what say you, to another Bottle of 
Champaign?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, for the Universe, not a drop more I
beseech you, O Intemperate! I have a flushing in my Face
already.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Takes out a Pocket-Glass, and looks in it.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Let me see, let me see, my Lord, I broke my Glass 
that was in the Lid of my Snuff-Box. Hum! Deuce take
me, I have encourag'd a Pimple here too.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Takes the Glass and looks.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then you must mortifie him, with a Patch; my
Wife shall supply you. Come, Gentlemen, <font> <foreign>allons</foreign> </font> .
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font> <foreign>Exeunt.</foreign> </font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="10" />
<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lady</font> Touchwood, <font>and</font> Maskwell.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll hear no more. -- Y' are False and 
Ungrateful; come, I know you false.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have been frail, I confess, Madam, for your 
Ladyships Service.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I should trust a Man, whom I had known
betray his Friend!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What Friend have I betray'd? Or to Whom?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your fond Friend <font>Mellefont</font> , and to me; can 
you deny it?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I do not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you not wrong'd my Lord, who has
been a Father to you in your wants, and given you being?
have you not wrong'd him in the highest manner, in his
Bed?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> With your Ladyships help, and for your Service, as I
told you before. I can't deny that neither. -- Any thing 
more, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> More! Audacious Villain. O what's more, is 
most my Shame, -- have you not Dishonoured 
me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, that I deny; for I never told in all my
Life: So that Accusation's Answer'd; on to the next.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Death, do you dally with my Passion? Insolent
Devil! But have a care, -- provoke me not; For, by
the Eternal Fire, you shall not scape my Vengance. -- 
Calm Villain! How unconcern'd he stands, Confessing
Treachery and Ingratitude! Is there Vice more black! --
O I have Excuses, Thousands for my Faults; Fire in my
Temper, Passions in my Soul apt to every provocation; oppressed
at once with Love, and with Despair. But a sedate, a
thinking Villain, whose Black Blood runs temperately bad,
what excuse can clear? one, who is no more moved with 
the reflection of his Crimes, than of his Face; but walks
unstartled from the Mirrour, and streight forgets the hideous
form.
<pagebreak id="11" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Will you be in Temper, Madam? I would not talk,
not to be heard. I have been </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>She Walks about Disorder'd.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
a very great Rogue for your sake, and you reproach me
with it; I am ready to be a Rogue still, to do you Service;
and you are flinging Conscience and Honour in my Face, to
rebate my Inclinations. How am I to behave my self? You
know I am your Creature, my Life and Fortune in your
power; to disoblige you, brings me certain Ruin. Allow
it, I would betray you, I would not be a Traytor to my
self: I don't pretend to Honesty, because you know I am a 
Rascal: But I would convince you, from the necessity of my
being firm with you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Necessity, Impudence! Can no Gratitude 
incline you, no Obligations touch you? Have not my
Fortune, and my Person, been subjected to your 
Pleasure? Were you not in the nature of a Servant, and
have not I in effect made you Lord of all, of me,
and of my Lord? Where is that humble Love, the
Languishing, that Adoration, which once was paid me,
and everlastingly engaged?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fix'd, Rooted in my Heart, whence nothing can 
remove 'em, yet you. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yet, what yet?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Misconceive me not, Madam, when I say
I have had a Generous, and a Faithful Passion, which
you had never favour'd, but through Revenge and 
Policy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Look you, Madam, we are alone, -- pray 
contain your self, and hear me. You know you Lov'd 
your Nephew, when I first Sigh'd for you; I quickly
found it, an Argument that I Lov'd; for with that
Art you veil'd your Passion, 'twas imperceptible to all
but Jealous Eyes. This discovery made me bold; I
confess it; for by it, I thought you in my Power.
Your Nephew's Scorn of you, added to my hopes; I
watch'd the Occasion, and took you, just Repulsed by
him, warm at once with Love and Indignation; your
<pagebreak id="12" />
Disposition, my Arguments, and happy Opportunity, 
accomplish'd my Design; I prest the yielding Minute, and
was blest. How, I have Lov'd you since, Words have 
not shown, then how should Words express.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, mollifying Devil! -- And have I not
met your Love with forward Fire?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Zeal I grant was Ardent, but misplac'd;
there was Revenge in view; that Womans Idol had
defil'd the Temple of the God, and Love was made a 
Mock-Worship, -- a Son and Heir, would have edg'd
Young <font>Mellefont</font> upon the brink of Ruin, and left him
nought but you to catch at for Prevention.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Again, provoke me! Do you wind me like a
Larum, only to rouse my own still'd Soul for your 
Diversion? Confusion!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Na, Madam, I'm gone, if you Relapse, -- what
needs this? I say nothing but what your self, in open
hours of Love, have told me. Why should you deny it?
Nay, how can you? Is not all this present Heat owing
to the same Fire? Do you not Love him still? How have 
I this day Offended you, but in not breaking off his Match 
with <font>Cynthia</font> ? Which e're to Morrow shall be done, -- 
had you but Patience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, what said you <font>Maskwell</font> -- another
Caprice, to unwind my temper.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By heaven, no; I am your Slave, the Slave of all
your Pleasures; and will not rest till I have given you peace,
would you suffer me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O' <font>Maskwell</font> , in Vain I do disguise me    
from thee,
thou know'st me, know'st the very inmost Windings and
Recesses of my Soul. -- Oh <font>Mellefont</font> ! I burn; Married
to Morrow! Despair strikes me. Yet my Soul knows I hate
him too: Let him but once be mine, and next immediate
Ruin seize him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Compose your self, You shall Enjoy and Ruin him 
too, -- Will that please you?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How, how? Thou Dear, thou precious Villain,
how?
<pagebreak id="13" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You have already been tampering with my Lady
<font>Plyant</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have: She is ready for any Impression I think
fit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She must be throughly perswaded, that <font>Mellefont</font>
Loves her.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Touch.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is so Credulous that way naturally,
and likes him so well, that she will believe it faster
than I can perswade her. But I don't see what you 
can propose from such a trifling design; for her first
Conversing with <font>Mellefont</font> , will convince her of the
contrary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know it. -- I don't depend upon it. -- 
But it will prepare some thing else; and gain us leasure
to lay a stronger Plot: if I gain a little time, I shall 
not want Contrivance.

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lady</font> Froth <font>and</font> Cynthia.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Cynthia.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Indeed, Madam! Is it Possible your Ladyship 
could have been so much in Love?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I could not sleep; I did not sleep one wink for
Three Weeks together.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Prodigious! I wonder, want of sleep, and so much 
Love, and so much Wit as your Ladyship has, did not turn
your Brain.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O my Dear <font>Cynthia</font> , you must not rally your
Friend, -- but really, as you say, I wonder too, -- 
but then I had a way. -- For between you and
I, I had Whymsies and Vapours, but I gave them 
vent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How pray, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O I Writ, Writ abundantly, -- do you
never Write?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Write, what?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Songs, Elegies, Satyrs, Encomiums, 
Panegyricks, Lampoons, Plays, or Heroick Poems.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord, not I, Madam; I'm content to be a 
Courteous Reader.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Inconsistent! In Love, and not Write!
if my Lord and I had been both of your Temper,
we had never come together, -- O bless me! What
a sad thing would that have been, if my Lord and I
should never have met!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then neither my Lord and you would ever have
met with your Match, on my Conscience.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O' my Conscience no more we should; thou
say'st right -- for sure my Lord <font>Froth</font> is as fine a 
Gentleman, and as much a Man of Quality! Ah! Nothing at
<pagebreak id="15" />
all of the Common Air, -- I think I may say he
wants nothing, but a Blue Ribbon and a Star, to make
him Shine, the very Phosphorus of our Hemisphere. Do
you understand those Two hard Words? If you don't,
I'll explain 'em to you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, yes, Madam, I'm not so Ignorant. -- 
At least I won't own it, to be troubled with your 
Instructions. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I beg your Pardon; but being 
Derived from the <font>Greek</font> , I thought you might have escap'd the
Etymology. -- But I'm the more amazed, to find 
you a Woman of Letters, and not Write! Bless me!
how can <font>Mellefont</font> believe you Love him?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why Faith, Madam, he that won't take my Word,
shall never have it under my Hand.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I Vow <font>Mellefont's</font> a pretty Gentleman, but
Methinks he wants a Manner.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> A Manner! what's that, Madam?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Some distinguishing Quality, as for example,  
the
<font> <foreign>Belle-air</foreign> </font> or <font> <foreign>Brillant</foreign> </font> of Mr. <font>Brisk</font> ; the     
Solemnity, yet
Complaisance of my Lord, or something of his own, that should 
look a little <font> <foreign>Jene-scay quoysh</foreign> </font> ; he is too much a          
Mediocrity,
in my mind.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He does not indeed affect either pertness, or 
formality; for which I like him: Here he comes.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And my Lord with him: pray observe the 
difference.

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lord</font> Froth, Mellefont, Brisk.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Impertinent Creature, I could almost be angry 
with her now. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, I have been telling my dear          
<font>Cynthia</font> ,
how much I have been in Love with you; I swear I have;
I'm not asham'd to own it now; ah! it makes my heart
leap, I vow I sigh when I think on't: my dear Lord! ha,
ha, ha, do you remember, my Lord? </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Squeezes him by
the hand, looks kindly on him, sighs, and then laughs out.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="16" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Pleasant Creature! perfectly well, ah! that 
look, ay, there it is; who could resist! 'twas so my heart
was made a Captive first, and ever since 't has been in 
Love with happy Slavery.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O that Tongue, that dear deceitful Tongue!
that Charming Softness in your Mien and your Expression,
and then your Bow! Good my Lord, bow as you did
when I gave you my Picture, here suppose this my 
Picture -- </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Gives him a Pocket-glass.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>
Pray mind, my Lord; ah! he bows Charmingly; nay, my
Lord, you sha'n't kiss it so much; I shall grow jealous, I
vow now. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>He bows profoundly low, then kisses the Glass.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I saw my self there, and kissed it for your
sake.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah! Gallantry to the last degree -- Mr.       
<font>Brisk</font> ,
you're a Judge; was ever any thing so well-bred as my
Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Never any thing; but your Ladyship, let me
perish.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O prettily turn'd again; let me die, but you 
have a great deal of Wit: Mr. <font>Mellefont</font> , don't you think
Mr. <font>Brisk</font> has a World of Wit?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, yes, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord, Madam -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> An infinite deal!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Jesu, Madam -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> More Wit than any Body.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm everlastingly your humble Servant, Deuce take
me, Madam.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't you think us a happy Couple?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I vow, my Lord, I think you the happiest
Couple in the World, for you are not only happy in one
another, and when you are together, but happy in your selves,
and by your selves.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I hope <font>Mellefont</font> will make a good Husband
too.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis my Interest to believe he will, my Lord.
<pagebreak id="17" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> D'e think he'll Love you as well as I do my
Wife? I'm afraid not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I believe he'll Love me better.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Heavens! that can never be; but why do you
think so?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because he has not so much reason to be fond of   
himself.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O your humble Servant for that, dear Madam;
well, <font>Mellefont</font> , you'll be a happy Creature.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, my Lord, I shall have the same reason for my
happiness that your Lordship has, I shall think my self happy.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ld. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ah, that's all.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> ( <font>to Lady</font> Froth) </nonSpeech><dialogue> Your Ladyship is in the     
right; but
I'gad I'm wholly turn'd into Satyr. I confess I Write but
seldom, but when I do -- keen <font>Iambicks</font> I'gad. But my
Lord was telling me, your Ladyship has made an Essay toward
an Heroick Poem.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Did my Lord tell you? Yes I vow, and the      
Subject
is my Lord's Love to me. And what do you think I call it?
I dare Swear you won't guesse -- <font>The Sillibub</font> , ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Because my Lord's Title's <font>Froth</font> , I'gad, ha, 
ha, ha,
Deuce take me very <font> <foreign>a Propos</foreign> </font> and Surprizing, ha, ha, ha.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He, Ay, is not it? -- and then I call my Lord
<font>Spumoso</font> ; and my self, what d'e think I call my self?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Lactilla</font> may be, -- 'gad I cannot tell.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Biddy</font> , that's all; just my own Name.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Biddy!</font> I'gad very pretty -- Deuce take me if
your Ladyship has not the Art of Surprizing the most
Naturally in the World, -- I hope you'll make me happy
in Communicating the Poem.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, you must be my Confident, I must ask 
your Advice.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Brisk.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm your Humble Servant, let me perish -- I
presume your Ladyship has Read <font>Bossu</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O yes, and <font>Rapine</font> , and <font>Dacier</font> upon   
<font>Aristotle</font>
and <font>Horace</font> . -- My Lord you must not be Jealous, I'm
Communicating all to Mr. <font>Brisk</font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, I'll allow Mr. <font>Brisk</font> ; have you
nothing about you to shew him, my Dear?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>L. Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I believe I have. -- Mr. <font>Brisk</font> , come
<pagebreak id="18" />
will you go into the next Room? and there I'll shew you all
I have. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> L. Froth <font>and</font> Brisk.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Ld. <font>Froth.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll walk a turn in the Garden, and come to 
you. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You're thoughtful, <font>Cynthia</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm thinking, that tho' Marriage makes Man and
Wife One Flesh, it leaves 'em still Two Fools; and they
become more Conspicuous by setting off one another.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That's only when Two Fools meet, and their follies
are oppos'd.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I have known Two Wits meet, and by the
opposition of their Wits, render themselves as ridiculous
as Fools. 'Tis an odd Game we're going to Play at:
What think you of drawing Stakes, and giving over in time?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, hang't, that's not endeavouring to Win,
because it's possible we may lose; since we have Shuffled
and Cutt, let's e'en turn up Trump now.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Then I find its like Cards, if either of us have a
good Hand, it is an Accident of Fortune.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, Marriage is rather like a Game at Bowls, 
Fortune indeed makes the match, and the Two nearest, and
sometimes the Two farthest are together, but the Game 
depends entirely upon Judgment.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Still it is a Game, and Consequently one of us must
be a Loser.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not at all; only a Friendly Tryal of Skill, and the
Winnings to be Shared between us. -- What's here, the
Musick! -- Oh, my Lord has promised the Company a 
New Song, we'll get 'em to give it us by the way.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Musicians crossing the Stage.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue>

I never saw him thus before.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hold your self Contented, my Lady <font>Plyant</font> , 
-- I
find Passion coming upon me by inspiration, and I cannot 
submit as formerly, therefore give way.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How now! will you be pleased to retire, and -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No marry will I not be pleased, I am pleased

   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What can this mean!

who are you? What am I? 'Slidikins can't I govern you?
What did I Marry you for? Am I not to be absolute and
uncontroulable? Is it fit a Woman of my Spirit, and Conduct, should
be contradicted in a matter of this Concern?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It concerns me, and only me; -- besides, I'm   
not to
be govern'd at all times. When I am in Tranquility, my Lady
<font>Plyant</font> shall Command Sir <font>Paul</font> ; but when I am provoked to
fury, I cannot incorporate with Patience and Reason, -- as soon
may Tygers Match with Tygers, Lambs with Lambs,
and every Creature couple with its Foe, as the Poet says. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> He's hot-headed still! 'Tis in vain to talk to you;
but remember I have a Curtain-Lecture for you, you 
disobedient, headstrong Brute.
<pagebreak id="20" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, 'tis because I won't be headstrong,        
because I
won't be a Brute, and have my Head fortifi'd, that I am thus 
exasperated, -- but I will protect my Honour, and yonder is the
Violater of my Fame.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> 'Tis my Honour that is concern'd, and the violation
was intended to me. Your Honour! You have none, but
what is in my keeping, and I can dispose of it when I please -- 
therefore don't provoke me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hum, gads bud she says true, -- well, my Lady,
March on, I will fight under you then: I am convinced, as far
as Passion will permit.

   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> <font>Thy, Thy</font> ,  come away <font>Thy</font> , touch him

Language!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have I behaved my self with all the decorum, and
nicety, befitting the Person of Sir <font>Paul's</font> Wife? Have I
preserved my Honour as it were in a Snow-House for this three year
past? Have I been white and unsulli'd even by Sir <font>Paul</font> himself?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>Paul.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, she has been an impenetrable Wife, even to

you take aim at my Wife? Gads bud I was never angry before

innocent.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Sir <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Innocent! why heark'ee, come hither <font>Thy</font> ,     
heark'ee,
I had it from his Aunt, my Sister <font>Touchwood</font> , -- gadsbud
he does not care a Farthing for any thing of thee, but thy
Portion, why he's in Love with my Wife; he would have
tantalized thee, and made a Cuckold of thy poor Father, -- 
and that would certainly have broke my Heart -- I'm sure
if ever I should have Horns, they would kill me; they would
never come kindly, I should dye of 'em, like any Child, that
were cutting his Teeth -- I should, indeed, <font>Thy</font> -- therefore
come away; but providence has prevented all, therefore
come away, when I bid you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Cynt.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I must obey. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Ex.</font> <font>Sir</font> Paul <font>and</font>      
Cynthia.</nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O, such a thing! the Impiety of it startles me -- 
to wrong so good, so fair a Creature, and one that lov'd you 
tenderly -- 'tis a barbarity of barbarities, and nothing could 
be guilty of it --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But the greatest Villain imagination can form, I
grant it; and next to the Villany of such a fact, is the 
Villany of aspersing me with the guilt. How? which way was
I to wrong her? for yet I understand you not.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Why, gads my life, Cousin <font>Mellefont</font> , you cannot
be so peremptory as to deny it; when I tax you with it to
your face; for now Sir <font>Paul's</font> gone, you are <font> <foreign>Corum            
Nobus</foreign> </font> .
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By Heaven, I love her more than life, or -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Fiddle, faddle, don't tell me of this and that, and
every thing in the World, but give me Mathemacular
Demonstration, answer me directly -- but I have not 
patience -- oh! the Impiety of it, as I was saying, and the 
unparallell'd wickedness! O merciful Father! how could you
think to reverse Nature so, to make the Daughter the means
of procuring the Mother?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> The Daughter procure the Mother!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ay, for tho' I am not <font>Cynthia's</font> own Mother, I am
her Father's Wife; and that's near enough to make it Incest.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Incest! O my precious Aunt, and the Devil in 
Conjunction. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="22" />
   <nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O reflect upon the horror of that, and then the
guilt of deceiving every body; Marrying the Daughter, 
only to make a Cuckold of the Father; and then seducing
me, debauching my purity, and perverting me from the
road of Virtue, in which I have trod thus long, and never
made one Trip, not one <font> <foreign>faux pas</foreign> </font> ; O consider it, what would
you have to answer for, if you should provoke me to
frailty? Alas! Humanity is feeble, Heaven knows! very feeble, 
and unable to support it self.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Where am I? sure, is it day? and am I awake,
Madam? --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> And no body knows how Circumstances may 
happen together, -- to my thinking, now I could resist
the strongest Temptation, -- but yet I know, 'tis 
impossible for me to know whether I could or no, there is no
certainty in the things of this life.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Madam, pray give me leave to ask you one
question. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O Lord, ask me the question, I'll swear I'll       
refuse it:
I swear I'll deny it, -- therefore don't ask me, nay you
shan't ask me, I swear I'll deny it. O Gemini, you have 
brought all the Blood into my face; I warrant, I am as red
as a Turky-Cock; O fie, Cousin <font>Mellefont</font> !
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, Madam, hear me; I mean -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Hear you, no, no; I'll deny you first, and hear you
afterwards: For one does not know how ones mind may
change upon hearing -- hearing is one of the Senses, and
all the Senses are fallible; I won't trust my Honour, I assure
you; my Honour is infallible and uncomatible.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> For Heaven's sake, Madam. --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O name it no more -- bless me, how can you talk
of Heaven! and have so much wickedness in your Heart?
May be you don't think it a sin, -- they say some of you
Gentlemen don't think it a sin, -- may be it is no sin to
them that don't think it so; -- indeed, if I did not think it
a sin, -- but still my honour, if it were no sin, -- but then,
to Marry my Daughter, for the Conveniency of frequent
Opportunities, -- I'll never consent to that, as sure as can
be, I'll break the Match.
<pagebreak id="23" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Death and amazement, -- Madam, upon my knees. -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>L. <font>P.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, nay, rise up, come you shall see my good
Nature. I know Love is powerful, and no body can help his 
passion: 'Tis not your fault; nor I swear it is not mine, --
how can I help it, if I have Charms? And how can you 
help it, if you are made a Captive; I swear it's pity it should
be a fault, -- but my honour -- well, but your honour 
too -- but the sin! -- well but the necessity -- O Lord,
here's some body coming, I dare not stay. Well, you must
consider of your Crime; and strive as much as can be
against it, -- strive besure -- but don't be melancholly, don't
despair, -- but never think that I'll grant you any thing; O
Lord, no; -- but besure you lay aside all thoughts of the 
Marriage, for tho' I know you don't Love <font>Cynthia</font> , only as a
blind for your Passion to me; yet it will make me jealous, -- 
O Lord, what did I say? Jealous! no, no, I can't be jealous,
for I must not Love you, -- therefore don't hope, -- but don't
despair neither, -- O, they're coming, I must fly. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech> <nonSpeech> <font> (after a pause,) </font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So then, -- spight of 
my care and
foresight, I am caught, caught in my security, -- yet this
was but a shallow artifice, unworthy of my Matchiavilian
Aunt: There must be more behind, this is but the first flash,
the priming of her Engine; destruction follows hard, if not
most presently prevented.
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Maskwell.</nonSpeech><dialogue>
<font>Maskwell</font> , welcome, thy presence is a view of Land,
appearing to my Shipwrack'd hopes: The Witch has rais'd
the Storm, and her Ministers have done their Work; you
see the Vessels are parted.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I know it; I met Sir <font>Paul</font> towing away         
<font>Cynthia</font> :
Come, trouble not your head, I'll joyn you together e're
to Morrow Morning, or drown between you in the attempt.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There's comfort in a hand stretch'd out, to one    
that's 
sinking; tho' ne'er so far off.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No sinking, nor no danger, -- come, cheer up;
why you don't know, that while I plead for you, your Aunt
has given me a retaining Fee; -- nay, I am your greatest 
Enemy, and she does but Journey-Work under me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha! how's this?
<pagebreak id="24" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What d'e think of my being employ'd in the execution 
of all her Plots? Ha, ha, ha, by Heaven it's true; I have 
undertaken to break the Match, I have undertaken to make your 
Uncle Disinherit you, to get you turn'd out of Doors; and to --
ha, ha, ha, I can't tell you for Laughing, -- oh she has open'd
her heart to me, -- I am to turn you a Grazing, and to -- ha,
ha, ha, Marry <font>Cynthia</font> my self; there's a Plot for you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha! O I see, I see my Rising Sun! Light breaks thro'
Clouds upon me, and I shall live in Day -- O my <font>Maskwell</font> !
how shall I thank or praise thee; Thou hast outwitted
Woman. -- But tell me, how could'st thou thus get into her
Confidence? -- Ha! How? But was it her Contrivance to perswade
my Lady <font>Plyant</font> to this extravagant belief?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It was, and to tell you the truth, I encouraged it 
for
your diversion: Tho it made you a little uneasy for the present,
yet the reflection of it must needs be entertaining, -- I
warrant she was very Violent at first.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha, I, a very Fury; but I was most afraid of
her violence at last, -- if you had not come as you did; I don't
know what she might have attempted.  
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Ha, ha, ha, I know her temper, -- well, you must
know then, that all my Contrivances were but Bubbles; till
at last I pretended to have been long Secretly in Love with 
<font>Cynthia</font> ; that did my business; that convinced your Aunt,
I might be trusted; since it was as much my interest as hers
to break the Match: Then she thought my Jealousie might
qualifie me to assist her in her Revenge. And, in short, in
that belief, told me the Secrets of her heart. At length we
made this agreement, if accomplish her designs <font> (as I told
you before) </font> she has ingaged to put <font>Cynthia</font> with all her Fortune
into my Power.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> She is most gracious in her Favour, -- well, and   
dear
<font>Jack</font> , how hast thou Contrived?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mas.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I would not have you stay to hear it now; for I    
don't
know, but she may come this way; I am to meet her anon,
after that I'll tell you the whole matter; be here in this 
Gallery an hour hence, by that time I imagine our Consultation may
be over.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mel.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will; till then, success attend thee.            
</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> </nonSpeech>
<pagebreak id="25" />
   <nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Till then, Success will attend me; for when I meet
you, I meet the only Obstacle to my Fortune. <font>Cynthia</font> , let 
thy Beauty gild my Crimes; and whatsoever I commit
of Treachery or Deceit, shall be imputed to me as a
Merit -- Treachery, what Treachery? Love cancels all 
the Bonds of Friendship, and sets Men right upon their first 
Foundations.  
   Duty to Kings, Piety to Parents, Gratitude to Benefactors, and
Fidelity to Friends, are different and particular Ties: But the
Name of Rival cuts 'em all asunder, and is a general 
acquittance -- Rival is equal, and Love like Death an universal
Leveller of Mankind. Ha! but is there not such a thing as 
Honesty? Yes, and whosoever has it about him, bears an 
Enemy in his Breast: For your honest man, as I take it, is 
that nice, scrupulous, conscientious Person, who will cheat
no body but himself; such another Coxcomb, as your wise
man, who is too hard for all the World, and will be made a 
Fool of by no body, but himself: Ha, ha, ha. Well for
Wisdom and Honesty, give me Cunning and Hypocrisie; oh
'tis such a pleasure, to angle for fair-faced Fools! then that
hungry Gudgeon Credulity, will bite at any thing -- Why,
let me see, I have the same Face, the same Words and Accents,
when I speak what I do think; and when I speak what I do
not think -- the very same -- and dear dissimulation is 
the only Art, not to be known from Nature.

<nonSpeech> <font>Enter Lord</font> Touchwood, <font>and Lady</font> Touchwood.</nonSpeech>

   <nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> My Lord, can you blame my Brother <font>Plyant</font> , if
he refuse his Daughter upon this Provocation?
The Contract's void by this unheard of Impiety.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't believe it true; he has better Principles 
--  
Pho, 'tis nonsense. Come, come, I know my Lady <font>Plyant</font> has
a large Eye, and wou'd centre every thing in her own Circle;
'tis not the first time she has mistaken Respect for Love, and
made Sir <font>Paul</font> jealous of the Civility of an undesigning
person, the better to bespeak his security in her unfeigned
Pleasures.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You censure hardly, my Lord; my Sister's Honour
is very well known.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Yes, I believe I know some that have been
familiarly acquainted with it. This is a little Trick wrought by
some pitiful Contriver, envious of my Nephew's Merit.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, my Lord, it may be so, and I hope it will
be found so: but that will require some time; for in such a 
Case as this, demonstration is necessary.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> There should have been demonstration of the 
contrary too, before it had been believ'd -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> So I suppose there was.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How! Where? When?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> That I can't tell; nay, I don't say there was -- 
I am willing to believe as favourably of my Nephew as I can.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know that. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>half aside.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? Don't you believe that, say you, my Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, I don't say so -- I confess I am troubled to
find you so cold in his Defence.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> His Defence! bless me, wou'd you have me
defend an ill thing?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You believe it then?
<pagebreak id="27" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I don't know; I am very unwilling to speak my
Thoughts in any thing that may be to my Cousin's 
disadvantage; besides, I find, my Lord, you are prepared to
receive an ill impression from any opinion of mine which is
not consenting with your own: But since I am like to be
suspected in the end, and 'tis a pain any longer to dissemble:
I own it to you; in short I do believe it, nay, and can 
believe any thing worse, if it were laid to his charge -- 
Don't ask me my Reasons, my Lord, for they are not fit to
be told you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'm amaz'd, here must be something more than
ordinary in this. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Aside.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Not fit to be told me, Madam?     
You
can have no Interests, wherein I am not concern'd, and 
consequently the same Reasons ought to be convincing to me,
which create your satisfaction or disquiet.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But those which cause my disquiet, I am willing
to have remote from your hearing. Good my Lord, don't
press me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Don't oblige me to press you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Whatever it was, 'tis past: And that is better to 
be unknown which cannot be prevented; therefore let me
beg you rest satisfied --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When you have told me, I will -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> You won't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By my Life, my Dear, I will.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> What if you can't.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How? Then I must know, nay I will: No more 
trifling -- I charge you tell me -- by all our mutual
Peace to come; upon your Duty --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, my Lord, you need say no more, to make
me lay my heart before you, but don't be thus transported;
compose your self: It is not of Concern, to make you lose
one minutes temper. 'Tis not indeed, my Dear. Nay, by 
this kiss you shan't be angry. O Lord, I wish I had not told
you any thing. Indeed, my Lord, you have frighted me.
Nay, look pleas'd, I'll tell you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well, well.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, but will you be calm -- indeed it's nothing  
but -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But what?
<pagebreak id="28" />
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> But will you promise me not to be angry -- nay
you must -- not to be angry with <font>Mellefont</font> -- I dare swear 
he's sorry -- and were it to do again, would not -- 
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Sorry, for what? 'Death you rack me with delay.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, no great matter, only -- well I have your
promise -- Pho, why nothing, only your Nephew had a
mind to amuse himself, sometimes with a little Gallantry 
towards me. Nay, I can't think he meant any thing seriously,
but methought it look'd odly.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Confusion and Hell, what do I hear!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Or, may be, he thought he was not enough a-kin
to me, upon your account, and had a mind to create a 
nearer relation on his own; a Lover you know, my Lord -- Ha,
ha, ha. Well but that's all -- now you have it; well
remember your promise, my Lord, and don't take any notice of
it to him.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> No, no, no -- Damnation!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Nay, I swear you must not -- a little harmless
mirth -- only misplac'd that's all -- but if it were more, 'tis
over now, and all's well. For my part I have forgot it; and
so has he, I hope -- for I have not heard any thing from
him these two days.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> These two days! Is it so fresh? Unnatural Villain!
'Death I'll have him stripp'd and turn'd naked out of my doors
this moment, and let him rot and perish, incestuous Brute!
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> O for Heaven's sake, my Lord, you'll ruine me
if you take such publick notice of it, it will be a Town-talk:
Consider your own and my Honour -- nay, I told you you
would not be satisfied when you knew it.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Before I've done, I will be satisfied. Ungrateful
Monster, how long? --
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Lord, I don't know: I wish my Lips had grown
together when I told you -- almost a Twelvemonth -- 
nay, I won't tell you any more, till you are your self. Pray,
my Lord, don't let the Company see you in this disorder -- 
Yet, I confess, I can't blame you; for I think I was never so
surpriz'd in my Life -- Who would have thought my
Nephew could have so misconstrued my Kindness -- but will

you go into your Closet, and recover your Temper. I'll <comment type="compiler">SOURCE      
TEXT: I'l FOLLOWED BY A SPACE</comment>
make an excuse of sudden Business to the Company, and
come to you. Pray, good dear my Lord, let me beg you
do now: I'll come immediately, and tell you all; will you
my Lord?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will -- I am mute with wonder.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well but go now, here's some body coming.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ld. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Well I go -- you won't stay, for I would hear
more of this. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit</font> Ld. <font>Touch.</font> </nonSpeech>
   <nonSpeech>Ldy. <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I follow instantly -- So.  

</dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Enter</font> Maskwell.</nonSpeech> 

   <nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> This was a Master-piece, and did not need my
help -- tho' I stood ready for a Cue to come in and 
confirm all, had there been occasion.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Have you seen <font>Mellefont</font> ?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I have; and am to meet him here about this
time.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How does he bear his Disappointment?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Secure in my Assistance, he seem'd not much
afflicted, but rather laugh'd at the shallow Artifice, which so
little time must of necessity discover. Yet he is apprehensive
of some farther design of yours, and has engaged me to
watch you. I believe he will hardly be able to prevent your
Plot, yet I would have you use Caution and
Expedition.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Expedition indeed; for all we do, must be 
perform'd in the remaining part of this Evening, and before the
Company break up; lest my Lord should cool, and have an
opportunity to talk with him privately -- my Lord must
not see him again.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> By no means; therefore you must aggravate my
Lord's Displeasure to a degree that will admit of no
Conference with him. -- What think you of mentioning me?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> How?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To my Lord, as having been privy to <font>Mellefont's</font>
design upon you, but still using my utmost Endeavours to
<pagebreak id="30" />
dissuade him: Tho' my Friendship and Love to him has made
me conceal it; yet you may say, I threatned the next time
he attempted any thing of that kind, to discover it to my 
Lord.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> To what end is this?
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> It will confirm my Lord's opinion of my Honour
and Honesty, and create in him a new Confidence in me,
which (should this design miscarry) will be necessary to the 
forming of another Plot that I have in my head -- to cheat
you, as well as the rest. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>aside.</font> </nonSpeech> 
   <nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I'll do it -- I'll tell him you hindred him once
from forcing me.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> Excellent! your Ladyship has a most improving
Fancy. You had best go to my Lord, keep him as long as 
you can in his Closet, and I doubt not but you will mould
him to what you please; your Guests are so engaged in their
own Follies and Intrigues, they'll miss neither of you.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech>Ldy <font>T.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> When shall we meet? -- at eight this Evening
in my Chamber; there rejoice at our success, and toy away
an hour in mirth.
   </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Mask.</font> </nonSpeech><dialogue> I will not fail. </dialogue><nonSpeech> <font>Exit.</font> Ldy <font>Touchwood</font> .</nonSpeech><dialogue>
I know what she means by toying away an hour well enough.
Pox I have lost all Appetite to her; yet she's a fine Woman,
I lov'd her once. But I don't know, since I have been in a 
great measure kept by her, the case is alter'd; what was my 
Pleasure is become my Duty: And I have as little stomach
to her now as if I were her Husband. Should she smoke
my design upon <font>Cynthia</font> , I were in a fine pickle. She has a
damn'd penetrating head, and knows how to interpret a
Coldness the right way; therefore I must dissemble Ardour
and Ecstasie, that's resolv'd: How easily and pleasantly is 
that dissembled before Fruition! Pox on't that a Man can't
drink without quenching his Thirst. Ha! yonder comes
<font>Mellefont</font> thoughtful. Let me think: Meet her at eight -- 
hum -- ha! by Heaven I have it -- if I can speak to my
Lord before -- Was it my Brain or Providence? No
Matter which -- I will deceive 'em all, and yet secure my self,
